                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA


    PATRICIA L. BAKER

          v.                                                  Civil No. 23-2013 (CKK)

                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION
                                      (July 26, 2024)

         Plaintiff Patricia Baker, proceeding pro se, filed a Complaint against Defendant Google

LLC (“Google”), seeking $2,500,000 after Defendant disabled her Google account due to the

presence of Child Sexual Abuse Material (“CSAM”). Plaintiff asserts that Defendant is liable for

breach of contract, fraud, violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United

States Constitution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Now pending before the

Court is Defendant’s [8] Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

12(b)(6). Upon consideration of the pleadings, the attachments thereto,1 the relevant legal

authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court shall GRANT Defendant’s [8] Motion to

Dismiss and shall DISMISS this case without prejudice.




1
    The Court’s consideration has focused on the following documents:
      • Plaintiff’s Complaint (“Compl.”), ECF No. 1-2;
      • Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (“Def.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 8;
      • Plaintiff’s Motion in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), ECF
         No. 10; and
      • Defendant’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant Google LLC’s Motion to
         Dismiss (“Def.’s Reply”), ECF No. 11.

                                                 1
                                         I. BACKGROUND

        For the purposes of the Motion before the Court, the Court accepts as true the allegations

in Plaintiff’s Complaint. The Court does “not accept as true, however, the plaintiff's legal

conclusions or inferences that are unsupported by the facts alleged.” Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on

Foreign Inv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Plaintiff proceeds in this matter pro se.

Complaints filed by pro se litigants are held to less stringent standards than those applied to

formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972); Brown v.

District of Columbia, 514 F.3d 1279, 1283 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Additionally, the Court must

consider not only the facts alleged in Plaintiff's Complaint, but also the facts alleged in Plaintiff’s

briefs filed in response to the Motions to Dismiss. See Brown v. Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc.,

789 F.3d 146, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“[A] district court errs in failing to consider a pro

se litigant's complaint ‘in light of’ all filings, including filings responsive to a motion to

dismiss.”) (quoting Richardson v. United States, 193 F.3d 545, 548 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); Fillmore v.

AT&T Mobility Servs. LLC, 140 F. Supp. 3d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2015) (JEB) (“The Court, as it must in

a case brought by a pro se plaintiff, considers the facts as alleged in both the Complaint and

Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.”). The Court recites only the

background necessary for the Court’s resolution of the pending Motion to Dismiss.

        Plaintiff was denied access to her Google account, patricia.baker500@gmail.com, in or

around March 2023. Compl. at 2, 8. Plaintiff received a notification explaining why Defendant

disabled her account. See id. at 8. This notification stated: “It looks like this account has content

that involves a child being sexually abused or exploited. This is a severe violation of Google’s

policies and might be illegal.” Id. Plaintiff denied having any CSAM and appealed Defendant’s

decision to disable her account through Defendant’s internal appeal process. See id. at 6, 9–11.




                                                   2
Her appeal was forwarded to Google’s video-hosting service, YouTube, which reviewed her

appeal and confirmed that her account violated Defendant’s Community Guidelines. Def.’s Mot.

at 3; Compl. at 10–1. Defendant therefore denied her appeal and the termination of Plaintiff’s

Google account––including her associated Gmail and YouTube accounts––was upheld. See

Def.’s Mot. at 3. Plaintiff has since been permanently denied access to her Google account. See

Compl. at 11; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 2.

       Plaintiff then retained counsel through a service LegalShield, who wrote a letter on her

behalf to Defendant asking them to provide her with the details of her alleged violation as well as

provide her with access to the contents of her account to migrate the information elsewhere.

Compl. at 6–7; see Pl.’s Opp’n at 2. Plaintiff has indicated that she cannot afford full

representation, id., and she therefore proceeds pro se in this matter.

       Plaintiff filed a Complaint in District of Columbia Superior Court on June 16, 2023.

Compl. at 2. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is liable for breach of contract; fraud; violations of

the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments; and intentional infliction of emotional distress; id.;

she requests $2,500,000 in damages. Id. at 12. Defendant removed the Complaint to this Court

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332. See Notice of Removal ¶¶ 9, 14, ECF No. 1.

Defendant then filed a [8] Motion to Dismiss on July 20, 2023, in which it argues that Plaintiff’s

pleadings fail to satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and 12(b)(6) and, additionally, that

Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. See

generally Def.’s Mot. This Motion is now ripe for the Court’s review.

                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD

       A party may move under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss a complaint on the grounds that it

“fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “[A]




                                                  3
complaint [does not] suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual

enhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). Rather, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations that, if

accepted as true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.

“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to

draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 

556U.S. at 678.

        In ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court accepts as true the

well-pleaded allegations in the operative complaint, but “not ... the plaintiff’s legal conclusions

or inferences that are unsupported by the facts alleged.” Ralls, 758 F.3d at 315. The Court may

consider not only “the facts alleged in the complaint” but also “documents attached to the

complaint as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint and matters about which the

Court may take judicial notice.” Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao, 226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196 (D.D.C.

2002) (RBW) (citing EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624–25 (D.C.

Cir. 1997)).

        Pro se pleadings are held to “less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by

lawyers,” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam), but still they must satisfy the

minimal requirement of alleging sufficient “factual matter” to permit a court “to infer more than

the mere possibility of misconduct,” Brown v. Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc., 789 F.3d 146, 150
(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Atherton v. District of Columbia Off. of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681–

82 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted)). When considering a motion to dismiss,

a court should read the pro se filings collectively. See Brown, 789 F.3d at 152 (“[A] district court

errs in failing to consider a pro se litigant’s complaint ‘in light of’ all filings, including filings




                                                    4
responsive to a motion to dismiss.”) (quoting Richardson v. United States, 193 F.3d 545, 548
(D.C. Cir. 1999)).

                                        III. DISCUSSION

       Defendant presents several arguments in support of its Motion to Dismiss. See generally

Def.’s Mot. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by Section 230 of the

Communications Decency Act; Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to satisfy Rule 8’s pleading

requirements; and Plaintiff failed to plead sufficient factual matter to render any of her claims

plausible. Id. at 1–2; see generally Def.’s Reply. The Court holds that Plaintiff’s Complaint fails

to meet the requirements set out by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and fails to state claims

upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) and, therefore, that Plaintiff’s Complaint

shall be dismissed without prejudice. In light of this conclusion, the Court need not address

whether Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act bars Plaintiff’s Complaint

   A. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8

       Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to satisfy basic pleading requirements in

support of her claims for breach of contract, fraud, constitutional violations, and intentional

infliction of emotional distress. Def.’s Mot. at 2, 8–9. The Court agrees.

       While pro se pleadings are held to “less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted

by lawyers,” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam), pro se litigants must

nevertheless comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Jarrell v. Tisch, 

656 F. Supp.237, 239 (D.D.C. 1987) (JGP); see also Fontaine v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 

42 F. Supp. 3d102, 107 (D.D.C. 2014) (KBJ) (“procedural rules must be followed [], and district courts have

discretion to dismiss a pro se plaintiff's complaint sua sponte for non-compliance”). Rule 8(a) of

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires complaints to contain “a short and plain statement


                                                  5
of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); see Iqbal, 556

U.S. at 678–79; Ciralsky v. CIA 355 F.3d 661, 668–71 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The purpose of the

minimum standard of Rule 8 is to give fair notice to the defendants of the claim being asserted,

sufficient to prepare a responsive answer, to prepare an adequate defense, and to determine

whether the doctrine of res judicata applies. Brown v. Califano, 75 F.R.D. 497, 498 (D.D.C.

1977) (JJS).

       Although Rule 8 does not expect “detailed factual allegations,” it does require enough

factual information “to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” Twombly, 

550 U.S. at544, and to “permit[] the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,” Jones v.

Horne, 634 F.3d 588, 596 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotations omitted). Courts in

this jurisdiction have routinely found that “[a] confused and rambling narrative of charges and

conclusions . . . does not comply with the requirements of Rule 8.” Cheeks v. Fort Myer Constr.

Corp., 71 F. Supp. 3d 163, 169 (D.D.C. 2014) (RCL) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also

Allen v. Mosseri, No. 1:22-cv-01366, 2022 WL 7182145, at *1 (D.D.C. 2022) (DLF) (dismissing

case because complaint “consists of a random collection of statements without clarity or

particularity”); Srulock-Zindler v. Zindler, No. 1:18-cv-01342, 2018 WL 11670246, at *1

(D.D.C. 2018) (RC) (dismissing case because complaint “fails to make out a discernable claim”);

Ferrell v. Fudge, No. 21-01412, 2023 WL 2043148, at *7 (D.D.C. 2023) (CKK) (dismissing case

because complaint “relies mostly on, at best, boilerplate allegations . . . with insinuations of a

conspiracy”). The Court notes that “[w]hile such a pro se litigant must of course be given fair

and equal treatment, [s]he cannot generally be permitted to shift the burden of litigating h[er]

case to the courts[.]” Dozier v. Ford Motor Co., 702 F.2d 1189, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 1983); see also

Roman v. National Reconnaissance Off., 952 F. Supp. 2d 159, 163 (D.D.C. 2013) (EGS) (“[A]




                                                  6
pro se complaint must still meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) to survive a Rule

12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.”).

       Plaintiff asserts some facts but relies primarily on conclusory allegations with

insinuations of a conspiracy orchestrated against her by Defendant. See, e.g., Compl. at 1–2;

Pl.’s Opp’n at 3–4. Plaintiff alleges that “Google, LLC falsely accused her of having content in

[her account] that supposedly involves a child being sexually abused or exploited,” id. at 1, but

does not expound upon this claim. She speculates that others, including Google, may be to

blame for the CSAM; for example, she claims that “Defendant Google, LLC may have

developed the illicit CSAM,” id. at 1–2, that “[i]f the CSAM material really exists, Plaintiff

states Defendant or a hacker developed it,” id. at 4, and later that “Plaintiff believes Defendant

(could have) induced or contributed to the development of this ugly material,” id. at 3. Plaintiff

asserts that “she is innocent of any wrongdoing” and that Google has “deprived Plaintiff other

[sic] gmail account for no proven reason.” Id. at 5. Plaintiff also includes information about

various hardships she has experienced, including the loss of family members, but fails to connect

them to her allegations against Defendant other than that “Plaintiff has to now deal with all of

this mess” in addition to her existing hardships. Id. at 6. Finally, Plaintiff contends that she “has

provided this Court with tangible facts of what Defendant Google LLC did to her – they took her

gmail account away from her without proper notice, and without any proof of what is alleged.”

Id. She demands $2.5 million in compensation. Compl. at 12.

       The Court finds that Plaintiff’s bare assertions fail to “give fair notice of the claim[s]

being asserted so as to permit [Defendant] the opportunity to . . . prepare an adequate defense.”

Brown, 75 F.R.D. 497 at 498. Although the Court sympathizes with Plaintiff’s situation, her

filings provide only a “confused and rambling narrative,” Cheeks, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 163, with




                                                  7
allegations of a conspiracy, Ferrell, 2023 WL 2043148, at *7, and a demand for millions of

dollars in damages for claims that the Court cannot say rise above a “speculative level” or “mere

possibility.” Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to fail to meet the requirements

of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.

   B. Rule 12(b)(6) Failure to State a Claim

       While Plaintiff’s failure to meet Rule 8’s pleading standard is sufficient for the Court to

dismiss her claims, the Court will also briefly address Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff fails to

state a plausible claim for relief. See Def.’s Mot. at 13–14; Def.’s Reply at 5–8. The Court shall

now address each of Plaintiff’s claims in turn.

           a. Breach of Contract

       Plaintiff argues that Defendant breached a contract allegedly created through Google’s

”Service Agreement” by disabling her Google account. See Compl. at 1; Pl.’s Opp’n at 4. But

Plaintiff does not allege any facts indicating that Defendant was contractually prohibited from

removing her Google account. See generally Compl.; Pl,’s Opp’n. Plaintiff only makes the

conclusory statement that “Defendant breached their contract with Plaintiff by not allowing her

to have access to her site.” See id. at 4. However, as Defendant points out, “[t]he applicable

terms of service are the Google Terms of Service… and the YouTube Terms of Service,” and

“[n]othing in these Terms of Service guarantees Plaintiff access to her Gmail account.” Def.’s

Reply at 5; see also id. Ex. 1 (Google’s Terms of Service); Ex. 2 (YouTube Terms of Service).

Furthermore, the Terms of Service specifically provide that Google can remove a user’s content

and suspend or terminate access to their Google services for a variety of reasons, including if the




                                                  8
user’s conduct is illegal or harmful. See Ex. 1 at 13; Ex. 2 at 12. Accordingly, the Court finds

that Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

           b. Fraud

       Plaintiff also claims that Defendant is liable for fraud. See Compl. at 1. In order to

establish a prima facie case of fraud under California law,2 Plaintiff must allege that there has

been: (a) misrepresentation; (b) knowledge of falsity; (c) intent to defraud; (d) justifiable

reliance; and (e) resulting damage. Lazar v. Superior Court, 909 P.2d 981, 984 (Cal. 1996). To

survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff need not make out a prima facie case of discrimination.

See Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F.3d 1111, 1114 (D.C. Cir. 2000). However, a plaintiff

must still allege “facts that, if true, would establish the elements of each claim,” Greer v. Bd. of

Trs. of Univ. of the D.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d 297, 310 (D.D.C. 2015) (TSC), and, therefore, “the

Court may explore the plaintiff’s prima facie case at the dismissal stage to determine whether the

plaintiff can ever meet [her] initial burden to establish a prima facie case,” Tressler v. Nat'l R.R.

Passenger Corp., 819 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2011) (RLW) (citation omitted).

       Plaintiff argues that “Defendant Google is guilty of fraud because they have deprived

Plaintiff other [sic] gmail account for no proven reason,” and that “[t]heir assertions are false,

thereby fraudulent. A literally true statement that creates a false impression can be actionable in

fraud.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 5. Beyond these conclusory statements, Plaintiff offers nothing to support

the elements of fraud––i.e., nothing to suggest that Google intended to defraud her, that she


2
  The relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant is governed by Google’s Terms of Service,
and these terms lay out that “California law [] govern[] all disputes arising out of or relating to
these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services.” See Def’s Reply Ex. 1 at
13. Accordingly, the Court shall apply California state law. See Milanovich v. Costa Crociere,
S.P.A., 954 F.2d 763, 767 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“Under American law, contractual choice-of-law
provisions are usually honored.”).

                                                  9
relied on any potential misrepresentations made by Defendant, or that any such reliance resulted

in damage. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for fraud upon

which relief can be granted.

           c. Constitutional Violations

       Plaintiff’s next claim is that Defendant violated her Constitutional rights under the First,

Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. See Compl. at 1. Specifically, she alleges that Google has

“in effect denied Plaintiff the ability to plead the ‘fifth’ if she were guilty of any wrong doing

here – which she is not,” and that Google has “denied her the right to life, liberty, and happiness”

under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pl.’s Opp’n at 5. She additionally claims that

Defendant violated her Due Process rights. Id.
       It is well-established that these constitutional rights “are protected only against

infringements by governments.” Lugar v. Edmonson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936 (1982) (quoting

Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 156 (1978)); see also Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507, 513
(1976) (“[T]he constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by

government, federal or state.”); Flagg Bros., 438 U.S. at 157 (“[O]nly a State or a private person

whose action may be fairly treated as that of the State itself may deprive him of an interest

encompassed within the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection[.]”) (citations and internal quotation

marks omitted); see Anderson v. USAir, Inc., 818 F.2d 49, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“[Appellant’s]

Fifth Amendment claim fails because [the] private corporation [] is not a state actor.”). Here,

Defendant Google is a private business, not a state actor,3 Freedom Watch, Inc. v. Google, Inc.,




3
 Plaintiff states that “the Corporation Service company is their registred [sic] agent for DC.”
Compl. at 3. To the extent that Plaintiff intended to allege that Google was a state actor, this
argument is insufficiently pled and fails.

                                                  10
368 F. Supp. 3d 30, 40 (D.D.C. 2019) (TNM) (finding Google is private business), aff’d, 818 F.

App’x 497 (D.C. Cir. 2020), and therefore cannot be held liable for the constitutional violations

that Plaintiff asserts. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth

Amendments likewise fail.

           d. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

       Finally, Plaintiff claims that Defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional

distress. See Compl. at 2; Pl.’s Opp’n at 5–6. Under California law, “[a] cause of action for

intentional infliction of emotional distress exists when there is (1) extreme and outrageous

conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing or reckless disregard of the probability of

causing emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and

(3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous

conduct.” Hughes v. Pair, 209 P.3d 963, 976 (Cal. 2009) (cleaned up).

       The Court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to meet the standard for

“severe or extreme emotional distress.” There is a “high bar” for severe and extreme emotional

distress, requiring the distress to have “such substantial quality or enduring quality that no

reasonable [person] . . . should be expected to endure it.” Id. Plaintiff has indicated that “[b]eing

accused of being involved in activity involving a child being hurt or abused is very disturbing

and upsetting;” she also alleges that she has suffered “stress,” “experience[d] pain,” and that this

has been “frustrating.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 6. Plaintiff’s experience of being very disturbed, upset,

and frustrated is similar to the suffering experienced by the plaintiff in Hughes v. Pair, which the

Supreme Court of California deemed to be insufficient to reach the level of severe emotional

distress. See Hughes, 209 P.3d at 976–77 (plaintiff complained of “discomfort, worry, anxiety,

upset stomach, concern, and agitation”); see also Def.’s Reply at 11 (“It was neither extreme nor


                                                  11
outrageous for Google to terminate Plaintiff’s account and privately inform her of its action and

reasons for doing so.”). Additionally, the hardships that Plaintiff discusses are mostly unrelated

to her incident with Defendant, although she indicates that she “has to now deal with all of this

mess concerning being falsely accused of having… (CSAM)” in addition to her existing

hardships. See Pl.’s Opp’n 6 (mentioning the death of relatives and her daughter’s health

conditions). Plaintiff has also not alleged any facts indicating that Defendant intended to cause

her any distress. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled facts required to state a

plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

                                          *       *       *

       In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the pleading requirements under

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and, additionally, has failed to state claims upon which relief

can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). Accordingly, the Court need not address whether Section

230 of the Communications Decency Act bars Plaintiff’s Complaint.

                                              IV. CONCLUSION

       For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s [8] Motion to Dismiss and

dismisses this matter without prejudice. An appropriate order accompanies this Memorandum

Opinion.

                 GONZALEZ v. GOOGLE LLC
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
                  the ninth circuit
    No. 21–1333. Argued February 21, 2023—Decided May 18, 2023
In 2015, Nohemi Gonzalez, a U. S. citizen, was killed in a set of coordinated
  terrorist attacks carried out across Paris, France, under the direction of
  the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Gonzalez's parents and
  brothers sued Google LLC under 18 U. S. C. § 2333(a) and (d)(2), alleging
  that Google was both directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist
  attack that killed Gonzalez. With regard to their secondary-liability
  claims under § 2333(d)(2), plaintiffs alleged that Google aided and abet-
  ted and conspired with ISIS through ISIS' use of YouTube, which
  Google owns and operates. The District Court dismissed plaintiffs'
  complaint for failure to state a claim, though it offered plaintiffs leave
  to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs opted to appeal, and the Ninth
  Circuit affrmed in a consolidated opinion that the Court also addressed
  in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U. S. 471. With regard to this case,

Page Proof Pending Publication
  the Ninth Circuit held that most of plaintiffs' claims were barred by
  § 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The sole exceptions
  were claims based on allegations that YouTube maintained a revenue-
  sharing system through which Google approved ISIS videos and shared
  revenue with ISIS; however, the court held that those allegations failed
  to state a viable claim in any event. Plaintiffs sought review in this
  Court of the Ninth Circuit's application of § 230 but not of that court's
  holdings regarding the revenue-sharing claims.
Held: The Court declines to address the application of § 230 to a complaint
  that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief. The
  secondary-liability claims here are materially identical to those in the
  Twitter plaintiffs' complaint, and thus it appears to follow from the hold-
  ing of that case that the complaint here fails to state a claim for aiding
  and abetting under § 2333(d)(2). The remainder of plaintiffs' claims
  here may be barred by the Ninth Circuit's unchallenged holdings below.
  Accordingly, the Court remands the case for the Ninth Circuit to con-
  sider plaintiffs' complaint in light of this Court's decision in Twitter.

     “ISIS” is shorthand for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. In some
form or another, it has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization
since 2004; ISIS has also been known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant, al Qaeda in Iraq, and the al-Zarqawi Network.

U. S. C. §§ 2333(a) and (d)(2), alleging that Google was both
directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist attack that
killed Gonzalez.2 For their secondary-liability claims, plain-
tiffs alleged that Google aided and abetted and conspired
with ISIS. All of their claims broadly center on the use of
YouTube, which Google owns and operates, by ISIS and
ISIS supporters.
   The District Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for fail-
ure to state a claim, though it offered plaintiffs leave to
amend their complaint. Instead, plaintiffs stood on their
complaint and appealed, and the Ninth Circuit affrmed in a
consolidated opinion that we also addressed in Twitter, Inc.
v. Taamneh, 598 U. S. 471 (2023). 2 F. 4th 871 (2021). With
respect to this case, the Ninth Circuit held that most of the
plaintiffs' claims were barred by § 230 of the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 137, 47 U. S. C. § 230(c)(1).
The sole exceptions were plaintiffs' direct- and secondary-
Page Proof Pending Publication
liability claims based on allegations that Google approved
ISIS videos for advertisements and then shared proceeds
with ISIS through YouTube's revenue-sharing system. The
Ninth Circuit held that these potential claims were not
barred by § 230, but that plaintiffs' allegations failed to state
a viable claim in any event.

    Title 18 U. S. C. § 2333(a) provides: “Any national of the United States
injured in his or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of
international terrorism, or his or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may sue
therefor in any appropriate district court of the United States and shall
recover threefold the damages he or she sustains and the cost of the suit,
including attorney's fees.” Section 2333(d)(2) provides: “In an action
under subsection (a) for an injury arising from an act of international ter-
rorism committed, planned, or authorized by an organization that had been
designated as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U. S. C. 1189), as of the date on which
such act of international terrorism was committed, planned, or authorized,
liability may be asserted as to any person who aids and abets, by know-
ingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person
who committed such an act of international terrorism.”
622                GONZALEZ v. GOOGLE LLC

                            Per Curiam

   We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's appli-
cation of § 230. See 598 U. S. ––– (2022). Plaintiffs did not
seek review of the Ninth Circuit's holdings regarding their
revenue-sharing claims. In light of those unchallenged hold-
ings and our disposition of Twitter, on which we also granted
certiorari and in which we today reverse the Ninth Circuit's
judgment, it has become clear that plaintiffs' complaint—
independent of § 230—states little if any claim for relief.
As plaintiffs concede, the allegations underlying their
secondary-liability claims are materially identical to those at
issue in Twitter. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. Since we hold
that the complaint in that case fails to state a claim for aiding
and abetting under § 2333(d)(2), it appears to follow that the
complaint here likewise fails to state such a claim. And, in
discussing plaintiffs' revenue-sharing claims, the Ninth Cir-
cuit held that plaintiffs plausibly alleged neither that “Google
reached an agreement with ISIS,” as required for conspiracy
liability, nor that Google's acts were “intended to intimidate
Page Proof Pending Publication
or coerce a civilian population, or to infuence or affect a
government,” as required for a direct-liability claim under
§ 2333(a). 2 F. 4th, at 901, 907. Perhaps for that reason,
at oral argument, plaintiffs only suggested that they should
receive leave to amend their complaint if we were to reverse
and remand in Twitter. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58, 163.
   We need not resolve either the viability of plaintiffs' claims
as a whole or whether plaintiffs should receive further leave
to amend. Rather, we think it suffcient to acknowledge
that much (if not all) of plaintiffs' complaint seems to fail
under either our decision in Twitter or the Ninth Circuit's
unchallenged holdings below. We therefore decline to ad-
dress the application of § 230 to a complaint that appears to
state little, if any, plausible claim for relief. Instead, we va-
cate the judgment below and remand the case for the Ninth
Circuit to consider plaintiffs' complaint in light of our deci-
sion in Twitter.
                                                  It is so ordered.

2                                           IN RE: GOOGLE LLC




    Google LLC (“Google”) petitions for a writ of manda-
mus directing the United States District Court for the
Western District of Texas to vacate its order denying
Google’s motion to transfer and to transfer the case to the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. Jawbone Innovations, LLC (“Jawbone”) op-
poses. For the following reasons, we grant the petition and
direct transfer.
                              I
     Jawbone filed this patent infringement suit against
Google in the Western District of Texas (“Western Dis-
trict”) in September 2021, four months after being assigned
ownership of the nine asserted patents and seven months
after being incorporated in Texas. Appx60, Appx63,
Appx909. Jawbone also rents space in Waco, Texas to store
documents relating to the patents, and from which it con-
ducts some distribution and sales activities, Appx486-87,
but no Jawbone personnel work in that or any other loca-
tion in the Western District, Appx918.
     Google moved under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to transfer the
action to the Northern District of California (“Northern
District”). It argued that: the relevant technical aspects of
the accused earbuds, smartphones, speakers, displays, and
software products at the center of Jawbone’s infringement
allegations were researched, designed, and developed at
Google’s headquarters within the Northern District,
Appx15; the technology underlying the asserted patents as-
signed to Jawbone was likewise developed and prosecuted
in Northern California (by a company that developed and
sold “Jawbone” products and once bore a “Jawbone” name),
Appx15, Appx433, Appx958; witnesses and sources of proof
(including prototypes of the accused products, Google’s key
personnel with knowledge about the technical and finan-
cial issues, and four of the six named inventors) were pri-
marily located in the Northern District, Appx2, Appx5; and

IN RE: GOOGLE LLC                                           3



no witnesses or sources of proof were located in the West-
ern District, Appx2.
    The district court denied the motion. The court
acknowledged that the Northern District had a compara-
tive advantage in being able to compel unwilling witnesses
and in being more convenient for more willing witnesses.
Appx933. On the other hand, the court also determined
that the court congestion factor and judicial economy con-
siderations weighed against transfer. Appx934. The re-
maining factors, the court determined, favored neither
forum. Id. On balance, the court concluded that Google
had failed to demonstrate that the Northern District was
clearly more convenient and, accordingly, denied transfer.
Id.                              II
     Our limited task on mandamus is to determine
whether the district court clearly abused its discretion. See
In re Juniper Networks, Inc., 14 F.4th 1313, 1318 (Fed. Cir.
2021). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), a district court
may transfer any civil action to any other district court
where the action might have been brought for the conven-
ience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.
We follow regional circuit standards governing motions un-
der § 1404(a). See In re TS Tech USA Corp., 
551 F.3d 1315,1319 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit has made clear that while “the decision
of whether to transfer a case is committed to the district
court’s discretion,” In re Planned Parenthood Fed. of Am.,
Inc., 52 F.4th 625, 629 (5th Cir. 2022), when a movant
“demonstrates that the transferee venue is clearly more
convenient” the district court “should” grant transfer, In re
Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 315 (5th Cir. 2008)
(en banc); see also Planned Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 629(“The ultimate inquiry is whether the destination venue is
‘clearly more convenient than the venue chosen by the
plaintiff.’”) (quoting Volkswagen, 545 F.3d at 315).

4                                            IN RE: GOOGLE LLC




    The Fifth Circuit has identified “private and public in-
terest factors,” which are “not necessarily exhaustive or ex-
clusive,” to be evaluated in connection with determining
whether a case should be transferred.                  Planned
Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 630 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The private interest factors are: (1) the relative
ease of access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of com-
pulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses; (3)
the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all
other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, ex-
peditious, and inexpensive. Id. The public interest factors
are: (1) the administrative difficulties flowing from court
congestion; (2) the local interest in having localized inter-
ests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with
the law that will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance of
unnecessary problems of conflict of laws or in the applica-
tion of foreign law. Id.     The district court found that two of these factors weigh
against transfer (one only slightly), two weigh in favor of
transfer (one only slightly), and the remaining four factors
are neutral. Appx933-34. Notwithstanding our deferential
standard of review, and the fact that assessing the weight
given to any of the factors – as well as their overall balance
– is within the “sound discretion of the trial court based not
on per se rules but rather on an individualized, case-by-
case consideration of convenience and fairness,” In re
Vistaprint Ltd., 628 F.3d 1342, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted), we conclude that the dis-
trict court clearly abused its discretion. As we discuss
below, once the clear errors are corrected, (a) the two fac-
tors the district court found weigh against transfer are, at
best for Jawbone, neutral; (b) the factor the district court
found weighs only slightly in favor of transfer actually
weighs heavily in favor of transfer; (c) two factors the dis-
trict court found to be neutral actually favor transfer; and
(d) the remaining three factors either favor transfer or are
neutral, as the district court found.

                              A
     The district court held that the factor considering “all
other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, ex-
peditious, and inexpensive” weighs against transfer. This
was clearly erroneous. The only reason the court gave for
this determination was Jawbone’s co-pending case against
Apple in the Western District of Texas. Appx929-30. How-
ever, Apple, like Google, moved to transfer to the Northern
District of California. 1 Moreover, at the time Google’s mo-
tion was pending, another case involving the same patents,
Jawbone v. Amazon, had been ordered transferred from the
Eastern District of Texas to the Northern District of Cali-
fornia. Appx891-908. Consequently, whatever efficiencies
would be had by combining cases asserting the same pa-
tents against different defendants with different accused
products are as likely to be enjoyed by transferring this
case as not. Hence, even before the recent dismissal of the
Apple case, see supra n.1, this factor is, at best for Jawbone,
neutral. As importantly, judicial economy considerations
could not undermine the clear case for transfer in light of
the imbalance on the other factors. See In re Samsung El-
ecs. Co., 2 F.4th 1371, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (noting that
“incremental gains” in judicial economy were not sufficient



    1    The district court discounted Apple’s pending mo-
tion to transfer on the ground that it had ordered the par-
ties in that case to go through full fact discovery and then
re-brief the transfer motion. Appx929-30. However, in the
Apple case, the district court subsequently vacated its or-
der in light of our decision in In re Apple, 52 F.4th 1360(Fed. Cir. 2022); stayed proceedings pending its resolution
of Apple’s transfer motion, Jawbone Innovations, LLC v.
Apple Inc., No. 6:21-cv-00984-ADA (W.D. Tex. Nov. 8,
2022); and subsequently granted those parties’ joint motion
to dismiss with prejudice, Jawbone, No. 6:21-cv-00984-
ADA (W.D. Tex. Dec. 23, 2022).

“to justify overriding the inconvenience to the parties and
witnesses”); Planned Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 632 n.5 (de-
clining to give significant weight to possibility of co-pend-
ing cases when those cases “involve[d] different parties[]
[and] different claims,” “although some factual issues may
be similar”).
    The district court held that the “administrative diffi-
culties flowing from court congestion” factor weighed
slightly against transfer. While we defer to the district
court’s assessment of the average time to trial data, see
Planned Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 631; In re Genentech, Inc.,
566 F.3d 1338, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“We do not disturb
the district court’s suggestion that it could dispose of the
case more quickly than if the case was transferred to the
Northern District of California.”), in this case it was a clear
abuse of discretion to accord this factor any weight, see Ju-
niper, 14 F.4th at 1322 (discounting time-to-trial difference
because there was no “need of a quick resolution” where
patentee lacked “position in the market . . . being threat-
ened”). It appears undisputed that Jawbone (unlike its
predecessor owners of the patents) is not engaged in prod-
uct competition in the marketplace and is not threatened
in the market in a way that, in other patent cases, might
add urgency to case resolution and give some significance
to the time-to-trial difference. Nor does the record reveal
any other basis on which to accord significance to whatever
greater speed the district court speculates it could reach
trial as compared to Northern California. See Genentech,
566 F.3d at 1347 (describing this factor as “most specula-
tive”). This factor, then, is neutral.
                              B
    The district court held that the “cost of attendance for
willing witnesses” factor weighed only slightly in favor of
transfer. This was clearly erroneous as this factor weighs
heavily in favor of transfer.

IN RE: GOOGLE LLC                                          7



    It is evident that the Northern District of California
would be more convenient for potential witnesses. In addi-
tion to several third-party witnesses located in the North-
ern District, Google submitted a sworn declaration from its
Discovery and Litigation Support team Project Manager,
Michelle True, which identified Google employees in the
Northern District who were part of the product and engi-
neering teams with technical knowledge of the accused
functionality, employees who authored articles that were
discussed in the complaint, and employees knowledgeable
about Google’s marketing of the accused products and fi-
nances. Appx21-28.
     The court weighed this factor only slightly in favor of
transfer after finding Ms. True’s declaration was unrelia-
ble, Appx920, but the steep discounting of this factor is un-
reasonable on the record. Ms. True’s investigation revealed
at least eleven Google employees in the Northern District
that the district court credited as potential witnesses,
Appx916, and found no Google employee in the Western
District of Texas who worked on what Google understood
to be the accused features, Appx21-23, Appx25, Appx27.
The district court faulted Ms. True for not addressing three
of Google’s Texas employees that Jawbone identified as
having potentially relevant knowledge based on Jawbone’s
review of their online profiles, but Google provided sworn,
unequivocal deposition testimony from each employee ex-
plaining that none of them work on the accused features.
Even if these three individuals had relevant and material
information, the court found that eleven other potential
witnesses reside in the Northern District. 2 On this record,



    2   The district court also discounted the declaration
on the ground that Ms. True was not an engineer who had
personally worked on the design, development, or testing
of the accused products. Appx914 n.2. But neither the
court nor Jawbone cited any authority that would impose

8                                           IN RE: GOOGLE LLC




the district court should have weighed this factor firmly
(not slightly) in favor of transfer.
                              C
    The district court held that the “local interest” factor
was neutral, but its conclusion was an abuse of discretion
as it gave significant weight to Jawbone’s office and corpo-
rate residence in Waco. Appx933. The court recognized
that Jawbone “established itself in Waco less than one year
before it filed this lawsuit,” id., and “none of its personnel
are here in this District,” Appx918. Jawbone incorporated
in Texas in February 2021 and established an office in
Waco in August 2021, just one month before it filed suit
against Google. Appx486. Jawbone conducts no activities
from Texas that relate to the accused technology.
Appx877-78. Under such circumstances, Jawbone has no
meaningful presence in the Western District of Texas that
should be given significant, let alone, comparable weight to
the facts tying the litigation to the California forum, where
both the patented and accused technology were developed.
See Juniper, 14 F.4th at 1320-21 (“[L]ittle or no weight
should be accorded to a party’s ‘recent and ephemeral’



such a requirement, and there is no reason to doubt the
adequacy of Ms. True’s investigation regarding the eleven
potential witnesses in the Northern District. That is so
even if the district court could legitimately fault Ms. True’s
statement that she was “not aware of any current Google
employees working on the Accused Features and the Ac-
cused Products,” in light of Google’s seeming concession
that some of its Texas employees work on aspects of the
accused products (though not, says Google, the accused fea-
tures). Appx27, Appx914 n.2. The statement reveals, at
most, a partial gap in Ms. True’s knowledge, but no basis
for substantially discounting the imbalanced nature of
where the potential Google witnesses are located.

presence in the transferor forum, such as by establishing
an office in order to claim a presence in the district for pur-
poses of litigation.”); In re Verizon Bus. Network Servs. Inc.,
635 F.3d 559, 562 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (giving no weight to lo-
cation of office in transferor forum where plaintiff had no
personnel but merely retained documents from prior litiga-
tion there).
     By contrast, the events giving rise to this patent in-
fringement suit clearly have a particularized connection
with Northern California. The patented technology was in-
vented in, and the patents prosecuted from, that forum.
Additionally, the district court found that Google developed
the accused products in the Northern District, notwith-
standing Google’s separate office in Austin. Appx932; see
also Def. Distributed v. Bruck, 30 F.4th 414, 435 (5th Cir.
2022) (“[T]he local interest in having localized interests de-
cided at home, ‘most notably regards not merely the par-
ties’ significant connections to each forum writ large, but
rather the significant connections between a particular
venue and the events that gave rise to a suit.’”) (quoting In
re Apple Inc., 979 F.3d 1332, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2020)). It was
clear error not to find that the local interest factor favors
transfer.
     The district court found the “relative ease of access to
sources of proof” factor was neutral. This was clearly erro-
neous as this factor favors transfer. Physical prototypes of
the accused products have been identified only as in the
Northern District of California, Appx21, Appx23, Appx25,
and four of the six inventors reside in the Northern Dis-
trict, as do the prosecuting attorneys, relevant former
Google employees, and third-party companies that provide
certain accused functionality for the accused products,
Appx22, Appx24. The Northern District would clearly pro-
vide easier access to sources of proof, including documents,
and be more convenient for potential non-party witnesses.

                               D
      We will address the remaining factors briefly. The dis-
 trict court correctly recognized that the “availability of
 compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses”
 favors transfer, as the Northern District could compel mul-
 tiple potential witnesses to appear at trial while no likely
 non-party witnesses have been identified whom the West-
 ern District has authority to compel. We agree with the
 district court, and both parties, that the “familiarity of the
 forum with the law that will govern the case” and the “prob-
 lems associated with conflicts of law” are neutral.
                              III
      In sum, on the record before us, four factors favor
 transfer and four factors are neutral. No factor weighs
 against transfer. The center of gravity of this action, focus-
 ing on the Volkswagen factors and the overriding conven-
 ience inquiry, is clearly in the Northern District of
 California, not in the Western District of Texas. The dis-
 trict court clearly erred in finding otherwise and its deci-
 sion to deny Google’s motion to transfer was a clear abuse
 of discretion.
      Accordingly,
      IT IS ORDERED THAT:
     The petition is granted. The district court’s order deny-
 ing Google’s motion to transfer is vacated, and the district
 court is directed to grant the transfer motion.

""5. The district court improperly discounted sworn declarations identifying key witnesses in California and failed to account for the significant imbalance in witness location."",

                                    MEMORANDUM OPINION
        Plaintiff, who appears to be incarcerated in Poland, initiated this matter on January 31,

2020. She filed a pro se complaint and first application for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

(“IFP”). The court found that plaintiff’s first IFP application was patently insufficient and failed

to provide any information whatsoever regarding her financial circumstances. See 28 U.S.C. §

1915(a)(1). In furtherance, on March 5, 2020, the court issued an order allowing plaintiff thirty

days to submit an acceptable amended IFP application or to pay the $400 filing fee applicable to

civil actions.

        On June 8, 2020, plaintiff filed a motion for extension of time, and in the following month,

she submitted three additional notices. Both the motion and the notices are mostly intelligible. On

July 6, 2020, plaintiff complied, albeit late, and filed an amended IFP application in response to

the court’s order. The court will grant the amended IFP application and now turn to plaintiff’s

complaint.

        The prolix complaint is written in both English and, ostensibly, Polish. Where the

complaint is in English is it nonetheless entirely incomprehensible. Plaintiff sues Google and other

unspecified defendants for violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The rambling complaint seems to (1)
take general issue with her incarceration in Poland, including her psychological and medical

treatment; (2) allege theft of intellectual property; (3) raise issues regarding unknown financial

information that she provided to “Polish courts” and other unknown “Polish institutions[;]” and

(4) allege that defendant attempted to murder her. Any other details are undecipherable. The relief

sought is unknown.

       Further, the complaint does not include facts that would give rise to a plausible inference

that the plaintiff has suffered the deprivation of a protected right, see Melton v. District of

Columbia, 85 F. Supp. 3d 183, 193 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Events may not have unfolded as Plaintiff

wished, but [her] dissatisfaction . . . [does] not form a basis for a due process violation”), or how

Google may be sued pursuant to Section 1983, where there is no indication that it is a state actor

acting under color of state law, see City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 829 (1985).

       Pro se litigants must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Jarrell v. Tisch,

656 F. Supp. 237, 239 (D.D.C. 1987). Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires

complaints to contain “(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction

[and] (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”

Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a); see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79 (2009); Ciralsky v. CIA, 

355 F.3d661, 668–71 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The Rule 8 standard ensures that defendants receive fair notice of

the claim being asserted so that they can prepare a responsive answer and an adequate defense and

determine whether the doctrine of res judicata applies. Brown v. Califano, 75 F.R.D. 497, 498
(D.D.C. 1977). “A confused and rambling narrative of charges and conclusions . . . does not

comply with the requirements of Rule 8.” Cheeks v. Fort Myer Constr. Corp., 

71 F. Supp. 3d 163,169 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
       The ambiguous allegations composing the complaint fail to provide adequate notice of any

claim. The intended causes of action and specific alleged wrongdoing committed by defendant

are undefined. The pleading also fails to set forth allegations with respect to this court’s

jurisdiction, or a valid basis for an award of damages. In fact, it is unclear what actual damages,

if any, plaintiff claims. Therefore, this case will be dismissed. A separate order accompanies this

memorandum opinion.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge REYNA.
  Opinion dissenting-in-part filed by Circuit Judge PROST.
 REYNA, Circuit Judge.
     EcoFactor sued Google in the Western District of Texas
 alleging patent infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,738,327.
 After discovery and resolution of various motions, the case
 was heard by a jury. The jury found that Google infringed
 the asserted claim 5 of the ’327 patent and awarded dam-
 ages to EcoFactor. Google appeals three of the district
 court’s orders: the denial of Google’s motion for summary
 judgment that claim 5 of the ’327 patent was invalid under
 35 U.S.C. § 101; the denial of Google’s motion for judgment
 as a matter of law of non-infringement of the ’327 patent;
 and the denial of Google’s motion for a new trial on dam-
 ages. For the following reasons, we affirm.
                         BACKGROUND
                 A. U.S. Patent No. 8,738,327
U.S. Patent No. 8,738,327 (“’327 patent”) relates gen-
 erally to the operation of smart thermostats in computer-
 networked heating and cooling systems (“HVAC systems”).
 The primary recited purpose of the patent is to reduce
 strain on the electricity grid during a period of expected
 high demand through adjustments to the user’s thermostat
 settings that reduce the electricity consumed by the user’s
 HVAC system. ’327 patent at 1:21–27, 9:46–54. Claim 1 of
 the ’327 patent recites a system “for controlling the opera-
 tional status of an HVAC system” where “at least one ther-
 mostat [is] associated with a structure that receives
 temperature measurements from inside the structure.” Id. at 9:26–31. Claim 1 includes an “estimation” limitation
 where “one or more servers receive inside temperatures
 from the thermostat and compare[] the inside tempera-
 tures of the structure and the outside temperatures over
 time to derive an estimation for the rate of change in inside
 temperature of the structure in response to outside

 temperature.” Id. at 9:38–45 (emphasis added). Claim 5
 adds that “the estimation [limitation in claim 1] is a pre-
 diction about the future rate of change in temperature in-
 side the structure.” Id. at 9:65–67.
                     B. Procedural History
      EcoFactor, owner of the ’327 patent, sued Google for
 patent infringement over Google’s smart thermostat prod-
 ucts, particularly several Nest thermostats. 1 After discov-
 ery, Google moved for summary judgment that certain
 claims of the ’327 patent (including claim 5) were invalid
 because they were directed to patent ineligible subject mat-
 ter, an abstract idea, under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The district
 court denied the motion. J.A. 5046.
     The district court also denied Google’s Daubert motion
 to exclude the opinion of EcoFactor’s damages expert, Mr.
 Kennedy, rejecting Google’s argument that Mr. Kennedy’s
 opinion was unreliable and therefore prejudicial.
 J.A. 2254.
     Following a six-day jury trial, the jury found that
 Google infringed claim 5 of the ’327 patent and awarded
 EcoFactor damages. J.A. 45–49. Google renewed its mo-
 tion for judgment as a matter of law (“JMOL”) of non-in-
 fringement of the ’327 patent, arguing that the accused
 products do not measure, but rather, estimate the temper-
 ature inside the structure and therefore cannot infringe.
 Google also moved for a new trial on damages, arguing that
 the opinion of EcoFactor’s damages expert, Mr. Kennedy,
 was speculative and unreliable such that it should have
 been excluded from trial. The district court denied both
 motions from the bench. J.A. 6662; J.A. 6688.

    Google appeals.          We     have   jurisdiction   under
 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).
                           DISCUSSION
     Google raises three issues on appeal. 2 First, Google
 contends the district court erred in denying Google’s mo-
 tion for summary judgment that claim 5 of the ’327 patent
 was directed to patent ineligible subject matter under
 § 101. Second, Google asserts the district court erred in
 denying Google’s JMOL motion for non-infringement of the
 ’327 patent. Third, Google contends the district court erred
 in denying Google’s motion for a new trial on damages be-
 cause Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion was based on unre-
 liable methodology. We address each issue in turn.
                      I. Patent Eligibility
     Google appeals the district court’s denial of summary
 judgment that claim 5 of the ’327 patent was patent ineli-
 gible under § 101.
     Section 101 of the Patent Act provides that: “Whoever
 invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and
 useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor,
 subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”
 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Supreme Court has articulated a two-
 step test, commonly referred to as the “Alice” test, for ex-
 amining whether a patent claims patent-ineligible subject
 matter. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Intern., 573 U.S.



2    This appeal was originally consolidated and in-
 cluded an original appeal by EcoFactor and cross-appeal by
 Google. The consolidated appeal contained other patents
 and issues. Prior to oral argument, the parties stipulated
 to the dismissal of the original appeal by EcoFactor, Appeal
 No. 22–1974, leaving only Google’s cross-appeal involving
 the ’327 patent. See Appeal No. 22–1974, ECF No. 59 at 7.

 208, 217–18 (2014). At Alice step one, we review whether
 a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept, such as an
 abstract idea. Id. At Alice step two, we review whether the
 claim recites elements sufficient to transform the abstract
 idea into a patent-eligible application. Id. at 217–18, 221.
     Prior to trial, Google filed a motion for summary judg-
 ment, arguing that claim 5 of the ’327 patent (among oth-
 ers) was invalid as directed to patent ineligible subject
 matter under § 101. The district court reviewed the mo-
 tion, relying on the Alice inquiry. The district court denied
 the motion and submitted step two of the Alice inquiry to
 the jury. J.A. 5046.
     At trial, the verdict form asked whether Google met its
 burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
 elements of claim 5 of the ’327 patent, when taken individ-
 ually and as an ordered combination, involved activities or
 technology that were well-understood, routine, or conven-
 tional to a skilled artisan at the time of the invention.
 J.A. 47. After hearing testimony and receiving evidence
 from both parties, the jury answered “no” for claim 5 of the
 ’327 patent. J.A. 47. Google filed a post-trial JMOL motion
 repeating its § 101 arguments, which the district court de-
 nied.
     Google now appeals the district court’s denial of sum-
 mary judgment regarding patent ineligibility of claim 5 of
 the ’327 patent, but we have held that a district court’s de-
 nial of summary judgment is not appealable after a trial on
 the merits. Syngenta Crop Prot., LLC v. Willowood, LLC,
 944 F.3d 1344, 1364 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citing Ortiz v. Jor-
 dan, 562 U.S. 180, 183–84 (2011)); see also 10 Wright and
 Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2715 (4th ed.) (ex-
 plaining a denial from summary judgment is an order
 “from which no immediate appeal is available”). We have
 explained that an order denying summary judgment is “not
 a judgment” and “does not foreclose trial on the issues on
 which summary judgment was sought;” rather, it is

 6                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 “merely a judge’s determination that genuine issues of ma-
 terial fact exist.” Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co., 
797 F.2d1564, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (reasoning that a denial of sum-
 mary judgment “does not settle or even tentatively decide
 anything about the merits of the claim” (citation omitted)).
 Denial of summary judgment decides only one thing—that
 the case should go to trial. Id.     At trial, the jury heard testimony from various wit-
 nesses on whether the elements of claim 5 were well-un-
 derstood, routine, or conventional. See, e.g., J.A. 5345–
 5346 (209:20–210:6); J.A. 6373–6374 (1237:15–1238:19);
 J.A. 6415–6416 (1279:1–1280:20); J.A. 6449–6451
 (1313:17–1315:11). Google, however, appeals the order
 denying summary judgment but not the jury verdict of in-
 eligibility. As the Supreme Court has explained, “the full
 record developed in court supersedes the record existing at
 the time of the summary-judgment motion.” Ortiz, 
562U.S. at 184. Because trial on the merits of the § 101 issue
 was held, the court’s denial of summary judgment is not
 appealable.
                      II. Infringement
     For infringement, the only limitation at issue is
 claim 1’s recitation of a system for controlling the HVAC
 system that includes a thermostat “that receives tempera-
 ture measurements from inside the structure.” ’327 patent
 at 9:26–31. Google alleges that because the accused ther-
 mostat products are designed to be completely enclosed in
 metal, plastic, and/or glass housings, they cannot directly
 measure the surrounding ambient temperature “inside the
 structure” like other thermostats. 3 Appellant Br. 41–44.



     3   The parties agree that the term “ambient tempera-
 ture” refers to the temperature surrounding a particular
 thermostat, i.e., the temperature of the room or structure
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18      Page: 7    Filed: 06/03/2024




 ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC                              7



 Google argues that its thermostats can only derive an esti-
 mate of the ambient temperature by measuring only the
 temperature within the thermostat housing itself, which is
 not “inside the structure.” See id. As a result, Google ar-
 gues that the jury’s verdict of infringement is unsupported
 by substantial evidence.
     We review the disposition of motions for JMOL under
 the law of the regional circuit, here the Fifth Circuit. See
 Energy Transp. Grp. Inc. v. William Demant Holding A/S,
 697 F.3d 1342, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The Fifth Circuit re-
 views de novo the grant or denial of a JMOL motion. Clear-
 Value, Inc. v. Pearl River Polymers, Inc., 
668 F.3d 1340,1343 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Under Fifth Circuit law, a jury’s ver-
 dict is upheld if supported by substantial evidence. Med.
 Care Am., Inc. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 
341 F.3d 415,420 (5th Cir. 2003).
      We conclude that the jury’s infringement verdict is sup-
 ported by substantial evidence. EcoFactor’s infringement
 expert testified that the accused thermostat products meet
 the claimed limitation because the thermostats measured
 temperature of the structure and not just the temperature
 within the thermostat housing.              J.A. 5462–63
 (326:20–327:6). EcoFactor’s expert supported his conclu-
 sion with several forms of evidence. EcoFactor’s expert re-
 lied on website guides maintained by Google for the benefit
 of software engineers who develop applications for use with
 Nest thermostats. One website page states that the Nest
 thermostats measure the “[a]mbient temperature,” defined
 as the “temperature measured near the thermostat”—not
 just within the thermostat. J.A. 10429 (emphasis added).
 Another website page explains that the temperature sen-
 sors of certain Nest products measure ambient room tem-
 perature. J.A. 10888. EcoFactor’s expert testified that this


 in which the thermostat is placed. Appellant Br. 13, 43;
 Appellee Br. 1, 9–10.

 8                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 evidence shows that the Nest thermostat “devices have
 temperature measurements near the thermostat” that
 measures the “inside temperature” of the structure and are
 not limited to measuring temperature inside the thermo-
 stat housing. J.A. 5453–55 (317:17–319:14). EcoFactor’s
 expert cited Google’s source code for the accused products
 and demonstrated where it described the function of the
 accused products to measure the surrounding temperature.
 J.A. 5456–60 (320:18–324:14).
     Google’s experts conceded the substance of EcoFactor’s
 evidence on cross-examination. Google’s non-infringement
 expert agreed that, according to Google’s website pages, the
 current ambient temperature in the room is measured by
 the Nest thermostat’s internal sensors. J.A. 6154–55
 (1018:9–1020:13). Another Google expert witness agreed
 that the accused thermostat products contain temperature
 sensors that measure the temperature inside customer
 homes. J.A. 5945–46 (809:4–809:17).
     The expert testimony from both parties, documentary
 evidence, and source code information demonstrating that
 the accused products measure temperature of the sur-
 rounding structure (and not just the housing) is substantial
 evidence. See In re Mouttet, 686 F.3d 1322, 1331 (Fed. Cir.
 2012) (explaining substantial evidence is “relevant evi-
 dence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
 support a conclusion”).
    In conclusion, the jury’s infringement verdict that the
 accused Nest thermostat products satisfy the claim lan-
 guage of “receives temperature measurements from inside
 the structure” is supported by substantial evidence.
                       III. Damages
     Google argues that the district court abused its discre-
 tion in denying its Rule 59 motion for a new trial on dam-
 ages. Appellant Br. 30. According to Google, a new trial
 on damages was warranted because the initial trial was
Case: 23-1101     Document: 18      Page: 9    Filed: 06/03/2024




 ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC                                9



 unfair or marred by prejudicial error. Id. at 25; J.A. 6689
 (91:4–8). The alleged error was the district court’s eviden-
 tiary ruling that the opinion of EcoFactor’s damages ex-
 pert, Mr. Kennedy, was admissible. Appellant Br. 25, 30.
 Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion should
 have been excluded from trial because it lacked any relia-
 ble methodology or underlying calculations. Id. at 30.
 Google also argues that Mr. Kennedy’s opinion should have
 been excluded for lack of comparability and apportionment.
 Id. at 34. We address each argument in turn.
     We review the denial of a motion for a new trial under
 regional circuit law. Wordtech Sys., Inc. v. Integrated Net-
 works Sols., Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The
 Fifth Circuit reviews a district court’s denial of a motion for
 a new trial for an abuse of discretion. Fornesa v. Fifth
 Third Mortg. Co., 897 F.3d 624, 627 (5th Cir. 2018). A new
 trial may be granted if the district court finds that “the ver-
 dict is against the weight of the evidence, the damages
 awarded are excessive, the trial was unfair, or prejudicial
 error was committed.” Seidman v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 
923F.2d 1134, 1140 (5th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted); Fed. R.
 Civ. P. 59. “Courts do not grant new trials unless it is rea-
 sonably clear that prejudicial error has crept into the rec-
 ord or that substantial justice has not been done, and the
 burden of showing harmful error rests on the party seeking
 the new trial.” Jordan v. Maxfield & Oberton Holdings,
 L.L.C., 977 F.3d 412, 417 (5th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).
      Here, Mr. Kennedy used the hypothetical negotiation
 approach for calculating reasonable royalty damages under
 35 U.S.C. § 284. This approach “necessarily involves an el-
 ement of approximation and uncertainty.” Lucent Techs.,
 Inc. v. Gateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2009)
 (citation omitted); see also generally 2 Janice M. Mueller,
 Mueller on Patent Enforcement § 20.04(a) at 869–70 (rev.
 ed. 2019). According to Mr. Kennedy, EcoFactor would
 have entered the hypothetical negotiation with the

 expectation of receiving a royalty in the amount of $X 4 per
 unit and would have requested that from Google.
 J.A. 1277. Based on this $X rate, Mr. Kennedy calculated
 his proposed damages amount of $Y 5.            J.A. 5740
 (604:14–17).
                                A.
     Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s damages model was
 speculative and conclusory. Appellant Br. 31. Specifically,
 Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s proposed $X royalty rate
 was “plucked . . . out of nowhere.” Id. at 34 (citation omit-
 ted). We disagree.
     “[W]hile all [damages] approximations involve some
 degree of uncertainty, the admissibility inquiry centers on
 whether the methodology employed is reliable.” Summit 6,
 LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 802 F.3d 1283, 1296 (Fed. Cir.
 2015). This includes whether a damages expert’s testi-
 mony is tied to the particular facts of the case. Virnetx, Inc.
 v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 767 F.3d 1308, 1333–34 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
 Whitserve, LLC v. Comput. Packages, Inc., 694 F.3d 10, 30 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Lucent Techs., 580 F.3d at 1330. Testi-
 mony is inadmissible when it is based only on speculation
 or guesswork, such that the jury is left to fill in the gaps
 when calculating a damages award. Whitserve, 694 F.3d at
 30–33 (holding that testimony was conclusory and specula-
 tive when expert did not explain how lump sum amounts
 could be converted to a reasonable royalty rate); Wordtech,
 609 F.3d at 1320 (holding that expert’s reliance on two




      4  The amount of the per-unit royalty rate is confiden-
 tial business information subject to a protective order, and
 as such, is not recited in this opinion.
      5  The amount of EcoFactor’s proposed damages
 award is confidential business information subject to a pro-
 tective order, and as such, is not recited in this opinion.
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18      Page: 11     Filed: 06/03/2024

 lump licenses was inappropriate when neither explained
 how the lump-sum amounts were calculated).
     Far from plucking the $X royalty rate from nowhere,
 Mr. Kennedy based this rate on the following admissible
 evidence: three license agreements and the testimony of
 EcoFactor’s CEO, Mr. Habib. Turning first to the agree-
 ments, Mr. Kennedy relied on three license agreements
 EcoFactor entered into with third-party smart thermostat
 manufacturers—the Schneider and Daikin licenses in
 2020, and the Johnson license in 2021. J.A. 10389–399;
 J.A. 10400–410; J.A. 10411–419. Each of these agreements
 included the same $X royalty rate at issue here. Each li-
 cense agreement provided in a whereas clause that the li-
 censee would pay EcoFactor a lump sum amount “set forth
 in this Agreement based on what EcoFactor believes is a
 reasonable royalty calculation of [$X] per-unit for . . . esti-
 mated past and [] projected future sales of products ac-
 cused of infringement in the Litigation.” J.A. 10389
 (emphasis added); J.A 10400; J.A. 10411. Thus, as Mr.
 Kennedy testified at trial, the $X royalty rate was “specifi-
 cally spelled out in the license agreement[s].” J.A. 5764
 (628:2–3).
      Mr. Kennedy then relied on the testimony of EcoFac-
 tor’s CEO, Mr. Habib, who signed the three license agree-
 ments on behalf of EcoFactor. J.A. 5794 (658:17–18);
 J.A. 5666 (530:23–25); J.A. 5669 (533:6–8). Mr. Habib tes-
 tified that he had seven years in the industry, an under-
 standing of the market, and “what is reasonable for the
 technologies that [EcoFactor] ha[s].”           J.A. 5670
 (534:22–25). He then testified that the lump sums con-
 tained in each of the three license agreements were based
 on the $X royalty rate. J.A. 5672, 536:17–18 (“[M]y under-
 standing was that all of it is based on [$X] per infringing
 unit.”). He testified that while he was shielded from the
 licensees’ confidential sales information, he understood
 that EcoFactor calculated each of the three licenses’ lump
 sums using the $X royalty rate and the past and future
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18     Page: 12    Filed: 06/03/2024




 12                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 projected sales for each licensee. J.A. 5798 (662:2–5); J.A.
 5670 (534:4–10). He also testified that despite being
 shielded from the licensees’ confidential sales numbers, he
 believed, based on his understanding of the market, that
 the lump sums reasonably reflected the licensees’ sales.
 J.A. 5672 (536:14–24). According to Mr. Habib, there were
 “large players” and high barriers to entry in the smart ther-
 mostat and smart HVAC control industry, and the licen-
 sees were “relatively new or more recent.” J.A. 5672
 (536:19–24). Thus, “it ma[de] sense that their sale num-
 bers would be low since they’d recently started.” J.A. 5672
 (536:23–24). He testified that the $X royalty rate in each
 of the three license agreements was accepted by the par-
 ties. J.A. 5671 (535:5–11) (“So, you know, if three compa-
 nies were willing to accept it, then yeah. That further
 made it clear to me that it was a reasonable royalty rate
 that was being accepted by counterparties.”).
     Finally, in support of Mr. Kennedy’s proposed $X roy-
 alty rate, EcoFactor introduced at trial an email chain be-
 tween EcoFactor and Johnson concerning the $X royalty
 rate. J.A. 10797–99; J.A. 6278 (1142:3–10). In the chain,
 which was dated a few months before the parties signed the
 license agreement, the parties discuss the $X royalty rate.
 J.A. 10797–99. Johnson notes that “[w]e are applying the
 [$X rate] to the time period” identified by EcoFactor.
 J.A. 10798.
     In light of the three license agreements, Mr. Habib’s
 testimony, and the EcoFactor-Johnson email chain, we de-
 termine that Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion concerning
 the $X royalty rate was sufficiently tied to the facts of the
 case and thus admissible. See Finjan, Inc. v. Secure Com-
 puting Corp., 626 F.3d 1197, 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2010); C & F
 Packing Co., v. IBP, Inc., 224 F.3d 1296, 1304–05 (Fed. Cir.
 2000). And based on this context, the “jury was entitled to
 hear the expert testimony” from Mr. Kennedy concerning
 the $X royalty rate and “decide for itself what to accept or
 reject.” Pavo Sols. LLC v. Kingston Tech. Co., 35 F.4th
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18     Page: 13    Filed: 06/03/2024




 ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC                             13



 1367, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (citation omitted). That is ex-
 actly what the jury did in this case. The jury heard Mr.
 Kennedy’s testimony and Google’s extensive cross-exami-
 nation concerning Mr. Kennedy’s understanding of the
 three license agreements, his reliance on Mr. Habib’s testi-
 mony, and testimony concerning the emails between Eco-
 Factor and Johnson about the $X royalty rate. J.A.
 5793–5812 (657:4–676:2); J.A. 5794 (658:17–18); J.A. 5667
 (531:8–25); J.A. 5668–5670 (532:3–534:3); J.A. 6278–6280
 (1142:6–1144:19). Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict
 of $20,019,300, which represents significantly less than
 Mr. Kennedy’s proposed damages amount of $Y that would
 have resulted from applying the $X royalty rate to Google’s
 past sales.
      Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s testimony is unreli-
 able because there is no evidence that the parties to the
 three license agreements actually applied the $X royalty
 rate. To the contrary. First, the three admissible license
 agreements each disclose that EcoFactor believed that the
 lump sums in each license was “based on” the $X royalty
 rate. Additionally, in its whereas clause, the Schneider li-
 cense agreement, unlike the Johnson and Daikin agree-
 ments, states that “nothing in this clause should be
 interpreted as agreement by Schneider that [$X] per unit
 is a reasonable royalty.” J.A. 10400. This clause, included
 by Schneider, speaks to its belief that $X may not have been
 reasonable but it does not speak to whether $X was actu-
 ally applied in arriving at the lump sum. Arguably, this
 provision, when read in context, could also mean that the
 $X royalty rate was applied by EcoFactor and Schneider.
 If Schneider did not believe that the $X royalty rate was
 actually being applied, it could have said such in the agree-
 ment. But Schneider did not. Finally, as noted above,
 Johnson noted in an email chain with EcoFactor that it was
 “applying” the $X royalty rate. How much weight should
 be given to the provisions in the license agreements, includ-
 ing whether they are “self-serving” as Google claims, and

 the EcoFactor-Johnson email is a question for the jury. See
 Pavo, 35 F.4th at 1379; Finjan, 626 F.3d at 1212; C & F
 Packing, 224 F.3d at 1304. 6
     To conclude, we determine that Mr. Kennedy’s opinion
 concerning the $X royalty rate was sufficiently reliable for
 admissibility purposes. For this reason, we hold that the
 district court did not abuse its discretion in denying
 Google’s motion for a new trial on damages.
                                B.
     Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s damages testimony
 should have also been excluded from trial for a lack of com-
 parability and apportionment. Appellant Br. 34. Google
 does not dispute the technical comparability between the
 three licenses and Mr. Kennedy’s hypothetically negotiated
 agreement. Nor could it. Mr. Kennedy relied on the testi-
 mony of EcoFactor’s technical expert, Mr. De la Iglesia, for
 his opinion that the three license agreements were



      6  The dissent relies on a statement in the body of the
 of the Schneider and Daikin license agreements to support
 its position that the parties did not apply the $X royalty
 rate contained in these two license agreements’ whereas
 clauses. See Dissent 3–6. This statement provides that the
 agreed to lump sum “does not reflect or constitute a roy-
 alty.” J.A. 10391; J.A. 10402. That the lump sum amount
 is not a royalty does not mean the parties did not use the
 $X royalty rate discussed in the agreements to arrive at the
 lump sum amount. But even if we were to set aside these
 two license agreements, the Johnson license agreement
 alone would suffice. As Google’s own expert agreed at trial,
 “just one” license agreement can be sufficient to support a
 damages opinion. J.A. 6269 (1133:10–14). This assertion
 comports with our damages precedent, which does not de-
 mand “absolute precision” but may involve some degree of
 approximation and uncertainty. Virnetx, 767 F.3d at 1328.

 technically comparable to the hypothetically negotiated li-
 cense. J.A. 5578–5583 (442:22–447:2); J.A. 5763
 (627:7–23); J.A. 5768 (632:7–19). Google’s experts did not
 rebut Mr. De la Iglesia’s opinion on this issue at trial. J.A.

     Damages owed to the patentee must reflect the value
 of only the patented improvement—called apportionment.
 Omega Pats., LLC v. CalAmp Corp., 13 F.4th 1361, 1376
 (Fed. Cir. 2021). If a sufficiently comparable license is used
 for determining the appropriate reasonable royalty rate,
 further apportionment may not be required because the
 comparable license has built-in apportionment. Id. at
1377. “Built-in apportionment effectively assumes that the
 negotiators of a comparable license settled on a royalty rate
 and royalty base combination embodying the value of the
 asserted patent.” Id. (citation omitted). “For built-in ap-
 portionment to apply, the license must be sufficiently com-
 parable in that principles of apportionment were effectively
 baked into the purportedly comparable license.” Id. (cita-
 tion omitted). Part of this comparability analysis requires
 an expert to account “for differences in the technologies and
 economic circumstances of the contracting parties” to the
 past licenses and to the hypothetical negotiation at issue.

773 F.3d1201, 1227 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Finjan, 626 F.3d at 1211. For
 example, in Bio-Rad, we concluded that there was no abuse
 of discretion in allowing an expert to testify about three li-
 censes, even though one of the licenses was ultimately not
 proven to be technically comparable to the hypothetically
 negotiated license. 967 F.3d at 1374 (holding that the “‘de-
 gree of comparability’ was appropriately left for the jury to
 decide”).
      Here, Mr. Kennedy sufficiently showed, for purposes of
 admissibility, that the three license agreements were eco-
 nomically comparable to the hypothetically negotiated
 agreement. Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that, based on Mr.
 De la Iglesia’s unrebutted testimony, the Schneider and
 Daikin licenses list seven technically comparable asserted
 patents, including the ’327 patent at issue in the hypothet-
 ically negotiated agreement. See J.A. 10398; J.A. 10409.
 He also noted that the Johnson license did not list the ’327
 patent as an asserted patent but listed four others that cov-
 ered the same interrelated smart thermostat technologies.
 J.A. 10411; J.A. 1276. Finally, Mr. Kennedy acknowledged
 that the three licenses also covered patents in EcoFactor’s
 portfolio that were not asserted in the underlying litigation
 facing Johnson, Schneider, and Daikin. J.A. 10398;
 J.A. 10409; J.A. 10411; J.A. 1275–76.
     Mr. Kennedy accounted for such differences. Mr. Ken-
 nedy testified that in arriving at the $X royalty rate in a
 hypothetical negotiation, Google would argue that the
 three license agreements included EcoFactor’s portfolio,
 not just the ’327 patent, and thus the $X royalty rate
 should be decreased. J.A. 5767 (631:19–23). Mr. Kennedy
 then provided that the three license agreements reflect a
 settlement and thus the $X royalty rate reflects a risk that
 that EcoFactor’s patents would be found not infringed or
 invalid. J.A. 1276. According to Mr. Kennedy, this consid-
 eration would not be present at the hypothetical

 negotiation between EcoFactor and Google, since the as-
 sumption is that the ’327 patent was infringed and valid.
 J.A. 1276. As a result, this point would place upward pres-
 sure on the negotiated rate.
      The three licenses aside, Mr. Kennedy separately
 grounded his apportionment opinion on underlying inter-
 nal profit and survey data from Google. Mr. Kennedy tes-
 tified that, based on underlying customer surveys from
 Google and based on EcoFactor’s technical expert’s testi-
 mony, the infringed technology at issue in this case at-
 tributed to Z% 7 of the profits for the infringed products.
 J.A. 5755–5758 (619:16–622:13); J.A. 5775–5777
 (639:22–641:7). Based on this data, Mr. Kennedy calcu-
 lated the amount of profit per unit that could be attributed
 to the ’327 patent, which was more than double the $X roy-
 alty rate. J.A. 5755–5758 (619:16–622:13). According to
 Mr. Kennedy, this would also place upward pressure on the
 negotiated rate at the hypothetical negotiation. J.A. 5780
 (644:6–7) (“And that’s EcoFactor’s response, saying it
 should actually be a lot higher.”). Mr. Kennedy thus con-
 cluded that the $X royalty rate “would be a very reasonable
 and conservative first offer.” J.A. 5779 (643: 17–18). This
 testimony is additional evidence for the jury to consider
 and weigh when calculating a damages award. C & F Pack-
 ing, 224 F.3d at 1304; ResQNet.com, Inc., v. Lansa, Inc.,
 594 F.3d 860, 869 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“At all times, the dam-
 ages inquiry must concentrate on compensation for the eco-
 nomic harm caused by infringement of the claimed
 invention.”).
     Based on this evidence, we conclude that the district
 court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a
 new trial on damages. Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion

 formation subject to a protective order, and as such, is not

 relied on sufficiently comparable licenses and his opinion
 sufficiently apportioned the value of the ’327 patent for the
 issue to be presented to the jury.
     Supporting our conclusion is ActiveVideo. There, the
 damages expert relied on an agreement that included the
 patents at issue and other software services without any
 alleged attempt to “disaggregate the value of the patent li-
 cense from the value of the services.” 694 F.3d at 1333 (ci-
 tation omitted). We held that there was no error in failing
 to exclude the expert’s testimony because the degree of
 comparability and “any failure on the part of [the] expert
 to control for certain variables are factual issues best ad-
 dressed by cross examination and not by exclusion.” Id.
 Here, Mr. Kennedy went further than the ActiveVideo ex-
 pert by sufficiently accounting for the economic differences
 between the patents in the three license agreements (as-
 serted and non-asserted) and the hypothetically negotiated
 agreement. And like in ActiveVideo, if there were any fail-
 ures to control for certain variables in comparability, these
 factual issues were for the jury to decide. Id.
     Contrary to Google’s position, our case law does not
 compel a contrary result. In Omega, we remanded for a
 new trial where the expert “merely identified . . . differ-
 ences” between the patents in the licenses and the patents
 in the hypothetical negotiation and did not distinguish
 such facts. 13 F.4th at 1380–81. In Apple, two of the three
 license agreements relied on by the expert did not list the
 subject patent all, and the third license listed the subject
 patent as a non-asserted patent in a long list of “hundreds
 of Non-Asserted patents.” Apple Inc. v. Wi-LAN Inc., 25
F.4th 960, 973 (Fed. Cir. 2022). We determined that there
 was no record evidence supporting the expert’s assumption
 that the subject patent was a “key patent” in these three
 licenses. Id.     Unlike in Omega and Apple, here we have two of the
 three licenses at issue explicitly listing the ’327 patent as

 an “asserted patent.” J.A. 10398; J.A. 10409. Additionally,
 Mr. Kennedy addressed and distinguished the remaining
 patents discussed in the license agreements. He testified
 that at the hypothetical negotiation, Google would empha-
 size the downward pressure that these patents would have
 on the $X royalty rate. Mr. Kennedy then testified that
 EcoFactor would note upward pressure on the $X royalty
 rate by assuming that the ’327 patent was valid and in-
 fringed. And, unlike in these cases, Mr. Kennedy sepa-
 rately rooted his apportionment analysis on underlying
 internal profit and survey data from Google. As previously
 noted, based on this data, Mr. Kennedy was able to deter-
 mine that the $X royalty rate was a conservative amount
 attributable to the ’327 patent.
     Google loses sight of the issue on appeal and the appli-
 cable standard of review. Our focus is on the admissibility
 of Mr. Kennedy’s damages testimony, and we assess the
 district court’s determination of this issue under the highly
 deferential abuse of discretion standard. “Credibility de-
 terminations, the weighing of the evidence, and the draw-
 ing of legitimate inferences from the facts” are jury
 functions, not those of a trial judge, and certainly not of an
 appellate judge. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods.,
 Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000) (citation omitted). If the
 standard for admissibility is raised too high, then the trial
 judge no longer acts as a gatekeeper but assumes the role
 of the jury.
      Based on the record before us, we conclude that the dis-
 trict court did not abuse its discretion when it denied
 Google’s motion for a new trial. Google has not shown that
 the district court’s decision to admit Mr. Kennedy’s dam-
 ages opinion resulted in prejudicial error or a substantial
 injustice requiring a new trial on damages.
                         CONCLUSION
     We have considered Google’s remaining arguments and
 find them unpersuasive. We reject Google’s attempt to

 PROST, Circuit Judge, dissenting-in-part.
     In recent years, our court has made some progress in
 clarifying important questions related to damages for pa-
 tent infringement. Such clarifications relate to deriving a
 reasonable royalty from a lump-sum license and requiring
 the patentee to confine its damages to the value of the pa-
 tented technology. Unfortunately, the majority opinion
 here at best muddles our precedent and at worst contra-
 dicts it. I therefore respectfully dissent from the decision

 to affirm the district court’s denial of Google’s motion for a
 new trial. 1
     Google argues that (1) Mr. Kennedy, EcoFactor’s dam-
 ages expert, calculated an $X royalty rate 2 from the Schnei-
 der, Daikin, and Johnson lump-sum licenses in an
 unreliable way; and (2) the $X rate in any event did not
 reflect the value of the ’327 patent (as distinct from that of
 other patents covered by those licenses). Google is right on
 both counts. The district court therefore, in my view,
 abused its discretion by not granting a new damages trial
 given Mr. Kennedy’s flawed testimony. 3
                                I
      Mr. Kennedy’s $X rate rests on EcoFactor’s self-serv-
 ing, unilateral “recitals” of its “beliefs” in the license agree-
 ments. These recitals are not only directly refuted by two
 of those same agreements; they also have no other support
 (e.g., sales data or other background testimony) to back
 them up. Our law does not allow damages to be so easily
 manufactured.
     When deriving reasonable royalties from lump-sum li-
 censes, we have emphasized that “lump sum payments . . .
 should not support running royalty rates without testi-
 mony explaining how they apply to the facts of the case.”


     1    I join the other aspects of the majority’s decision.
     2    Because the specific per-unit royalty rate that Mr.
 Kennedy uses has been designated confidential, I use $X to
 refer to his rate.
     3    When reviewing a district court’s exercise of discre-
 tion on a critical, often-complicated evidentiary decision
 such as a damages-expert Daubert, it usually helps to see
 the court’s explanation for its decision. Here, at both the
 Daubert stage and in the context of Google’s new-trial mo-
 tion, the district court gave no explanation. J.A. 2254,
 6687–89.

 Whitserve, LLC v. Comput. Packages, Inc., 694 F.3d 10, 30 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway,
 Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (requiring that
 “some basis for comparison must exist in the evidence pre-
 sented to the jury”). We have vacated damages awards
 where the derivation of a reasonable royalty from a lump
 sum was “incompatible with the . . . agreement as a whole,”
 MLC Intell. Prop., LLC v. Micron Tech., Inc., 10 F.4th 1358,
 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2021), where there was no testimony ex-
 plaining how lump-sum “payments could be converted to a
 royalty rate,” Whitserve, 694 F.3d at 30, and where “[n]ei-
 ther license describe[d] how the parties calculated each
 lump sum,” Wordtech Sys., Inc. v. Integrated Network Sols.,
 Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Mr. Kennedy’s
 $X rate repeats the same fatal errors we identified in MLC,
 Whitserve, and Wordtech. As in those cases, the licenses
 here are for a lump-sum amount with no record evidence
 supporting a calculation of a royalty rate.
      Consider what these licenses do (and do not) say.
 Starting with the Schneider license, one preliminary re-
 cital states: “WHEREAS EcoFactor represents that it has
 agreed to the payment set forth in this Agreement based
 on what [it] believes is a reasonable royalty calculation of
 [$X] per-unit for what it has estimated is past and pro-
 jected future sales of products accused of infringement in
 this Litigation.” J.A. 10400 (emphasis added). Yet the
 body of the license (i.e., its substantive and agreed upon
 terms and conditions)—which, unlike the recitals, reflects
 the view of both parties—says that its lump-sum payment
 “is not based upon sales and does not reflect or constitute a
 royalty.” J.A. 10402 (emphasis added).
     The Daikin and Johnson licenses both contain nearly
 identical preliminary recitals about the $X rate.
 J.A. 10389; J.A. 10411. As in the Schneider license, the
 body of the Daikin license—which, again, reflects the view
 of both parties—says that its lump-sum payment “is not
 based upon sales and does not reflect or constitute a

 royalty.” J.A. 10391 (emphasis added). And while the
 Johnson license lacks a similar refutation of the recital’s
 “belief” (a belief that, again, was EcoFactor’s alone), it still
 offers nothing more than the recital itself to support any
 royalty rate.
     These recitals became Mr. Kennedy’s $X rate.
 J.A. 5764 (628:10–17); J.A. 5769 (633:9–18); J.A. 5772–73
 (636:22–637:4). Mr. Kennedy also relied on the testimony
 of EcoFactor’s CEO, Mr. Habib, as support for this rate.
 J.A. 5794 (658:17–18). But Mr. Habib’s testimony does not
 establish anything beyond his unsupported “understand-
 ing” that these licenses used the $X royalty rate. See
 J.A. 5668–69 (532:23–533:2). When asked during direct
 examination about the basis for his “understanding,” Mr.
 Habib testified that he was not allowed to see any underly-
 ing financial information or sales data. J.A. 5670 (534:4–
 14). Mr. Habib also explained his basis for believing that
 the $X rate was a reasonable rate based on his understand-
 ing of the market, J.A. 5672 (536:14–24), but his market-
 based testimony provided no explanation for converting
 from the lump-sum payments in these licenses to any roy-
 alty rate, let alone the $X royalty rate. 4
     On this record, it’s impossible to establish that these
 lump-sum payments were calculated using any royalty
 rate, let alone the specific $X rate. The self-serving recitals
 reflect only EcoFactor’s transparent attempt to


     4   The only other basis Mr. Habib offers is that the $X
 royalty rate was EcoFactor’s baseline policy for licensing,
 regardless of the number of patents. J.A. 5671 (535:12–
 24). Understandably, neither the majority nor EcoFactor
 rely on the baseline policy as a valid basis for Mr. Habib’s
 understanding that the $X rate was used. See Omega
 Pats., LLC v. CalAmp Corp., 13 F.4th 1361, 1379–80 (Fed.
 Cir. 2021) (concluding that a comparable license analysis
 using a baseline royalty rate policy is unreliable).

 manufacture a royalty rate using its “belief.” EcoFactor
 even had to refute its “belief” by agreeing, in the Schneider
 and Daikin licenses, that the lump-sum payment is not a
 royalty. Mr. Kennedy’s assertion that the Schneider and
 Daikin licenses used the $X rate is “incompatible with the
 . . . agreement[s] as a whole.” MLC Intell. Prop., 10 F.4th
 at 1368. And the Johnson license does not “describe how
 the parties calculated [the] lump sum.” Wordtech Sys., 
609F.3d at 1320.
     Mr. Kennedy cited nothing else showing that the $X
 rate was actually used. He cited no documents, records,
 sales data, or testimony showing any calculation of the
 lump-sum payments or otherwise establishing that these
 licenses used the $X rate. Mr. Habib’s testimony, relying
 on no underlying data, likewise offers no support. EcoFac-
 tor offered no testimony explaining how the lump-sum
 “payments could be converted to a royalty rate.” Whitserve,
 694 F.3d at 30.
     At bottom, all we have are the recitals of one party’s
 “beliefs” contradicted by mutually agreed upon contractual
 language by both parties. That’s not enough under our law.
      None of the majority’s responses on this issue with-
 stand scrutiny. The majority first insists that the Schnei-
 der and Daikin licenses do not disclaim the $X royalty rate.
 It reasons, “[t]hat the lump sum amount is not a royalty
 does not mean [that] the parties did not use the $X royalty
 rate discussed in the agreements to arrive at the lump sum
 amount.” Maj. 14 n.6 (emphasis in original). If the major-
 ity’s point is that a lump sum is not itself a royalty, then
 fair enough—no one disputes that truism. The issue here,
 however, is whether the lump sum in these licenses reflects
 the application of the $X royalty rate (or, in the majority’s
 words, whether it was used “to arrive at the lump sum
 amount”). And the majority cannot credibly claim that was
 the case when the licenses themselves say that each lump-
 sum payment “is not based upon sales and does not reflect

 6                              ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 or constitute a royalty.” J.A. 10391, 10402 (emphasis
 added). I’m not sure how these licenses could more clearly
 establish that the lump sums were not calculated using
 royalties.
     The majority next asserts that “the Johnson license
 agreement alone would suffice.” Maj. 14 n.6. But the John-
 son license contains no language describing how its lump-
 sum payment was calculated, see Wordtech Sys., 
609 F.3dat 1320, and Mr. Kennedy offered no other basis from
 which he could conclude that the Johnson license used the
 $X rate.
     The majority also cites an email chain that purportedly
 concerns the use of the $X rate in the Johnson license. But
 Mr. Kennedy never discussed this email; EcoFactor intro-
 duced this email during the cross-examination of Google’s
 expert. J.A. 6278 (1142:3–10). The question here is not
 whether any document in the record supports the jury’s
 damages award. We are instead asking whether Mr. Ken-
 nedy’s testimony was so unreliable that it requires a new
 trial. I can’t see how an email Mr. Kennedy never ad-
 dressed supports the reliability of his analysis.
     In the end, Mr. Kennedy conjured the $X rate from
 nothing, and the majority’s treatment of his analysis can-
 not be squared with our law or the facts.
                               II
     Even if these licenses used the $X rate, Mr. Kennedy’s
 analysis has another significant problem: the $X rate does
 not reflect the ’327 patent’s value; rather, it includes the
 value of other patents. Our law is clear that this basic fail-
 ure requires a new trial.

 sonable royalty, we require a party to account for differ-
 ences in the technologies and economic circumstances of
 the contracting parties.” Apple Inc. v. Wi-LAN Inc., 25

 accounting, although not overly rigid and involving approx-
 imation, requires apportioning to just the value of patent(s)
 in the hypothetical negotiation. Omega Pats., LLC v.
 CalAmp Corp., 13 F.4th 1361, 1380–81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
 This apportionment must be tied to the facts of each case.
 Id. at 1379–80.
     The licenses here have a broad scope. Each license is
 to “all patents and patent applications (along with patents
 issuing thereon) . . . that are now, or ever come to be, as-
 signed to, owned by, or controlled by EcoFactor.”
 J.A. 10390; J.A. 10401; J.A. 10412. Because each license
 reflects a settlement, they also list the patents asserted in
 each underlying litigation. The Schneider and Daikin li-
 censes list seven asserted patents, including the ’327 pa-
 tent. J.A. 10398, 10409. The Johnson license lists four
 asserted patents; none are the ’327 patent. J.A. 10411.
     When calculating the ’327 patent’s value, Mr. Kennedy
 relied on EcoFactor’s technical expert, Mr. de la Iglesia,
 who compared the asserted patents in each license to the
 ’327 patent and concluded that the asserted patents and
 the ’327 patent were technologically comparable. J.A.
 5578–82 (442:14–446:10). But EcoFactor’s technical expert
 didn’t discuss the remaining patents in each license—the
 non-asserted patents in EcoFactor’s portfolio. 5 Rather, Mr.
 Kennedy explained that since, “in the real world,” “the rest
 of the patents are thrown in usually either for nothing or
 very little additional value,” the presence of these non-as-
 serted patents would place “downward pressure on the roy-
 alty rate” in a hypothetical negotiation over the ’327




     5    Although we don’t know the exact size of EcoFac-
 tor’s portfolio, at least one document suggests that EcoFac-
 tor’s portfolio is over three times larger than the seven
 asserted patents in the Schneider and Daikin licenses.

 patent. J.A. 5767–68 (631:22–632:2); see also J.A. 5771–72
 (635:19–636:3).
      Mr. Kennedy’s opinion is “untethered to the facts of
 this case.” Apple, 25 F.4th at 973. His generic testimony
 about “the real world,” general industry practice, and
 “downward pressure” does not account for the impact of
 EcoFactor’s specific non-asserted patents, and we don’t
 know whether any non-asserted patent in EcoFactor’s port-
 folio covers the same technological areas as the asserted
 patents. Mr. Kennedy did not ask the necessary question
 under our law—what effect the specific non-asserted pa-
 tents in EcoFactor’s portfolio would have on the hypothet-
 ical negotiation. 6 Even worse, other evidence in the record
 indicates that the specific non-asserted patents were not
 considered at all. Mr. Habib testified that the remaining
 patents in EcoFactor’s portfolio had no effect on the rate
 used in these licenses because the $X rate was EcoFactor’s
 baseline policy. J.A. 5671 (535:12–24).
     In the end, Mr. Kennedy’s circumstance-agnostic anal-
 ysis is insufficient under our law. Apple, 25 F.4th at 973
 (vacating a verdict where the same expert as in this case,
 Mr. Kennedy, testified that excluding the non-asserted pa-
 tents in a portfolio license would reduce the royalty rate by
 25 percent as a matter of industry practice); Omega Pats.,
 13 F.4th at 1379 (vacating a verdict where the proposed
 $5.00 royalty rate was the same for any number of patents);
 MLC Intell. Prop., 10 F.4th at 1375 (vacating a verdict




     6  It would not be difficult for EcoFactor to offer an
 answer. For example, Mr. de la Iglesia could have deter-
 mined that the non-asserted patents in the Schneider, Dai-
 kin, and Johnson licenses have no technological overlap
 with the ’327 patent and concluded that the non-asserted
 patents added only nominal value to the license.

 where no evidence or explanation supported using the roy-
 alty rate in a forty-one-patent license for a single patent).
      The majority, in excusing Mr. Kennedy’s failure to
 properly apportion, ignores our law’s requirements. It
 merely states that Mr. Kennedy “acknowledged that the
 three licenses also covered patents not in EcoFactor’s port-
 folio.” Maj. 16. But the majority ignores the key fail-
 ure—Mr. Kennedy failed to account for the impact of the
 specific remaining patents in EcoFactor’s portfolio, other
 than by referencing a generic “downward pressure.” Nei-
 ther Mr. Kennedy nor Mr. de la Iglesia tied this “downward
 pressure” to the specific non-asserted patents, and Mr.
 Habib affirmatively testified that EcoFactor’s practice was
 to use the same $X rate regardless of the number of pa-
 tents. In these circumstances, I “fail to see how this pa-
 tent/claim-independent       approach      accounts      for
 apportionment.” Omega Pats., 13 F.4th at 1379.
      The majority also relies on ActiveVideo Networks, Inc.
 v. Verizon Communications, Inc., 694 F.3d 1312 (Fed. Cir.
 2012), for its conclusion. But in ActiveVideo, we concluded
 that “disagreements . . . with the conclusions reached by
 ActiveVideo’s experts and the factual assumptions and con-
 siderations underlying those conclusions” were “factual is-
 sues best addressed by cross examination and not
 exclusion.” Id. at 1333. Our conclusion presupposed that
 “the methodology is sound” and that “the evidence relied
 upon [is] sufficiently related to the case at hand.” i4i Ltd.
 P’Ship v. Microsoft Corp., 598 F.3d 831, 852 (Fed. Cir.
 2010), aff’d, 564 U.S. 91 (2011). As I explained above,
 that’s far from the case here. And to the extent the major-
 ity relies on one party’s characterization in ActiveVideo of
 the expert’s opinion as failing to “disaggregate the value of
 the patent license from the value of the services,” Maj. 18,
 we did not adopt that characterization of the expert’s opin-
 ion, see ActiveVideo, 694 F.3d at 1333. Additionally, any
 suggestion that disaggregating the value of the patented
 technology from the overall value of a license is not

 10                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 required is flatly inconsistent with our law and 140 years
 of Supreme Court precedent. See VirnetX, Inc. v. Cisco
 Sys., Inc., 767 F.3d 1308, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“[A] pa-
 tentee ‘must in every case give evidence tending to sepa-
 rate or apportion the defendant’s profits and the patentee’s
 damages between the patented feature and the unpatented
 features.’” (quoting Garretson v. Clark, 111 U.S. 120, 121 (1884))).
     To establish a purportedly independent basis for Mr.
 Kennedy’s conclusion, the majority asserts that he demon-
 strated the reasonableness of his $X rate by analyzing
 Google’s profits. Maj. 17. Mr. Kennedy determined what
 profits on Google’s accused Nest thermostats came from
 features that he maintained were attributable to the ’327
 patent. He then split the profits between Google and Eco-
 Factor, using the $X rate as a reasonable basis. See J.A.
 5778 (642:13–17). His methodology isn’t reasonable. Ra-
 ther than offering a cross-check, Mr. Kennedy’s circular
 profit analysis begins and ends with the same “fundamen-
 tally flawed premise”—the $X rate. Uniloc USA, Inc. v.
 Microsoft Corp., 632 F.3d 1292, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2011).
     Ultimately, the majority’s real concern is that, “[i]f the
 standard for admissibility is raised too high, then the trial
 judge no longer acts as the gatekeeper but assumes the role
 of the jury.” Maj. 19. But we must pay close attention to
 the reliability of the methodology underlying expert testi-
 mony to ensure that the jury can fulfill its proper role as
 the factfinder. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 
522 U.S. 136,142 (1997) (emphasizing the district court’s “gatekeeper”
 role in “screening” expert testimony). As the Supreme
 Court has recognized, “the expert’s testimony often will
 rest upon an experience confessedly foreign in kind to the
 jury’s own.” Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 
526 U.S. 137,149 (1999) (cleaned up). Thus, an “effort to assure that the
 specialized testimony is reliable and relevant can help the
 jury evaluate that foreign experience.” Id. Our damages
 law ensures that an expert asks the right questions. Many

 admissible answers to these questions are possible, and it
 is those answers that are subject to the crucible of cross-
 examination. Mr. Kennedy failed to ask the right ques-
 tions at multiple junctures. The majority’s decision to over-
 look the prejudicial impact of his unreliable testimony
 abdicates its responsibility as a gatekeeper and contradicts
 our precedent.
                              III
      Mr. Kennedy’s analysis is unreliable. His $X rate has
 no basis in the record, and his $X rate does not reflect the
 ’327 patent’s value alone but instead includes the value of
 other patents. Mr. Kennedy’s testimony did not meet the
 baseline standards of admissibility, and therefore the dis-
 trict court abused its discretion by not granting a new trial
 on damages. The majority’s conclusion otherwise departs
 from our law. I respectfully dissent.",https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9510518/ecofactor-inc-v-google-llc/?type=o&type=o&q=google&order_by=score+desc,"{

                          SUMMARY *


                        Data Collection

    The panel reversed the district court’s summary
judgment in favor of Google, LLC, in a class action alleging
that the company surreptitiously collected users’ data in
violation of various state and federal laws, and remanded for
further proceedings.
    Plaintiffs are a group of Google Chrome users who chose
not to sync their Chrome browsers with their Google
accounts while browsing the web. As they allege in their
complaint, Plaintiffs believed, based on the terms of
Google’s Chrome Privacy Notice, that their choice not to
sync Chrome with their Google accounts meant that certain
personal information would not be collected and used by
Google. The district court held that Google successfully
proved that Plaintiffs consented to its data collection.
    The panel explained that the district court should have
reviewed the terms of Google’s various disclosures and
decided whether a reasonable user reading them would think
that he or she was consenting to the data collection. By
focusing on “browser agnosticism” instead of conducting the
reasonable person inquiry, the district court failed to apply
the correct standard. Viewed in the light most favorable to
Plaintiffs, browser agnosticism is irrelevant because nothing
in Google’s disclosures is tied to what other browsers do.

 This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has
been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.
                  CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                   3


    Because applying the correct standard reveals disputes
of material fact regarding whether “reasonable” users of
Google’s product consented to Google’s data collection
practices, the panel remanded the issue of consent—
assuming a plaintiff class is certified—to the district court
for trial.

                         OPINION

M. SMITH, Circuit Judge:

    Plaintiff-Appellants Patrick Calhoun, Elaine Crespo,
Michael Henry, Cornice Wilson, Rodney Johnson, and
Claudia Kindler brought this class action lawsuit against
Defendant-Appellee Google, LLC, alleging that the
company surreptitiously collected users’ data in violation of
various state and federal laws. The district court granted
summary judgment in favor of Google, holding that Google
had successfully proven that Plaintiffs consented to its data
collection. For the reasons explained below, we reverse and
remand.
  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
    Plaintiffs are a group of Google Chrome users who
“chose not to ‘Sync’ their [Chrome] browsers with their
Google accounts while browsing the web from July 27, 2016
to the present.” As they allege in their complaint, Plaintiffs
believed that their choice not to sync Chrome with their
Google accounts meant that certain “personal information”
would not be collected and used by Google. Their belief was
based on the terms of Google’s “Chrome Privacy Notice,”
which “describes features that are specific to Chrome,” and
states in relevant part:

       You don’t need to provide any personal
       information to use Chrome, but Chrome has

       anonymized and aggregated with data from
       other users . . .

Notwithstanding the above statements, Plaintiffs allege that
“Google intentionally and unlawfully causes Chrome to
record and send users’ personal information to Google
regardless of whether a user elects to Sync or even has a
Google account.”      Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that
“Chrome sends the following personal information to
Google when a user exchanges communications with any
website that includes Google surveillance source code—

again, regardless of whether a user is logged-in to Google

         a. The user’s unique, persistent cookie 1
         identifiers;
         b. The user’s browsing history in the form of
         the contents of the users’ GET requests 2 and
         information relating to the substance,
         purport, or meaning of the website’s portion
         of the communication with the user;
         c. In many cases, the contents of the users’
         POST 3 communications;
         d. The user’s IP address 4 and User-Agent
         information about their device; and
         e. The user’s x-client-data identifier. 5

    A. Motion to Dismiss
    At the motion to dismiss stage, Google did not deny
collecting Plaintiffs’ data while using Chrome in an un-
synced mode. Instead, it asserted that Plaintiffs consented to
this data collection when they agreed to Google’s Privacy
Policy, 6 which policy is cross-referenced in the part of the
Chrome Privacy Notice discussing “Sign-in and Sync
Chrome modes.” Google argued that the Policy “disclosed
the alleged data collection” per the following terms:

        We collect information about the services
        that you use and how you use them, like when
        you . . . visit a website that uses our
        advertising services, or view and interact
        with our ads and content.
        This information includes: . . . device-
        specific information . . .
        When you use our services or view content
        provided by Google, we automatically collect
        and store certain information in server logs,
        [including] details of how you used our
        service, such as your search queries . . .
        device event information such as . . . the date
        and time of your request and referral URL
        [and] cookies that may uniquely identify your
        browser or your Google Account.




6
  The Privacy Policy is incorporated in Google’s Terms of Service
(TOS), which all Plaintiffs agreed to.
10                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


While the district court recognized that consent is a valid
legal defense to Plaintiffs’ claims, it rejected Google’s
arguments that it had met its burden to establish the defense.
    First, the court noted that Google’s General Terms of
Service (TOS), which incorporates the Privacy Policy, states
that where “these terms conflict with the service-specific
additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that
service.” It further noted that the Privacy Policy directed
readers to “additional terms for particular services,” and
included a hyperlink to the Chrome Privacy Notice. These
statements—combined with Google’s more specific
representation in the Chrome Privacy Notice that “the
personal information that Chrome stores won’t be sent to
Google unless you . . . turn[] on sync”—led the court to
conclude that a reasonable user would not think they were
consenting to the data collection at issue. The court noted
that a reasonable user viewing these disclosures might think
“that if he or she used Chrome without sync, his or her
personal information would not be sent to Google.”
    Second, the court rejected Google’s argument that the
Chrome Privacy Notice was accurate regarding how Google
would treat “the personal information that Chrome stores”
because “readers would understand that ‘the personal
information that Chrome stores’” does not include the data
collection at issue in this case. The court rejected this
argument because the data collection “falls within the
definition of personal information under California law,
which governs Google’s [TOS],” and the terms of Google’s
own privacy policy.
    In sum, the court concluded that “Google cannot show
that Plaintiffs expressly consented to Google’s collection of
data,” and that “[t]o the contrary, Google’s representations
                    CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                      11


might have led a reasonable user to believe that Google did
not collect his or her personal information when the user was
not synced.” It thus denied Google’s motion to dismiss on
its consent defense. 7
    B. Motion for Summary Judgment
   Google moved for summary judgment. In its summary
judgment briefing, Google introduced two additional notices
in support of its consent defense: the “Consent Bump
Agreement,” which it launched in June 2016, and the “New
Account Creation Agreement,” updated in June 2016.
    The “Consent Bump Agreement” “is a push down banner
that Google showed to account holders either when they
visited a ‘Google owned-and-operated property’ while
signed into their account or when users signed into their
account for the first time after June 2016.” It reads in
relevant part:

        [W]hen you use[] Google services like
        Search and YouTube, you generate data—
        things like what you’ve searched for and
        videos you’ve watched. You can find and
        control that data in My Account under the
        Web & App Activity setting. With this
        change, this setting may also include
        browsing data from Chrome and activity
        from sites and apps that partner with Google,
        including those that show ads from Google.

  This case was originally assigned to Judge Lucy H. Koh. After the
motion to dismiss order was issued, however, Judge Koh was elevated
to the Ninth Circuit, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was assigned
to adjudicate the case.
12                  CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


The “New Account Creation Agreement” incorporates the
Privacy Policy, and states:

        When you search for a restaurant on Google
        Maps or watch a video on YouTube, for
        example, we process information about that
        activity—including information like the
        video you watched, device IDs, IP addresses,
        cookie data, and location.
        We also process the kinds of information
        described above when you use apps or sites
        that use Google services like ads, Analytics,
        and the YouTube video player . . .
        We also combine data among our services
        and across your devices for these purposes.

The district court referred to these agreements, along with
the Privacy Policy, collectively, as “Google’s general
policies” to distinguish them from the Chrome-specific
Privacy Notice.
    Assuming that only Google’s “general policies” or the
Chrome Privacy Notice could govern Google’s conduct in
this case, the court identified the threshold issue at summary
judgment as “which agreement controls the at-issue data
collection.” “Plaintiffs contend[ed] that the Chrome Privacy
Notice applie[d] because they are Chrome users using the
Chrome browser.” “Google . . . argue[d] that because the
data collection at issue . . . is ‘browser-agnostic,’ Google’s
general policies apply.”
    After holding a lengthy evidentiary hearing on the issue,
the court found that the collection of data listed in Plaintiffs’
complaint (the “at-issue data” collection) was “browser-
                      CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                           13


agnostic,” except for the X-client-data-header. 8 In other
words, the court found that the data Plaintiffs complained
was improperly collected was “transmitted to Google
regardless of the browser used.”
    The court then explained the significance of the
“browser-agnostic” finding: “Because the Court finds that
the at-issue data collected is not specific to Chrome but
browser agnostic, the Court also finds that Google’s general
policies apply.” “More specifically, the General Privacy
Policy, New Account Creation Agreement, and Consent
Bump Agreement governs the collection of those categories
of information identified by plaintiffs.”
    The district court then explained that all Plaintiffs had
consented to the general Privacy Policy, and at least some
had agreed to the Consent Bump Agreement and the New
Account Creation Agreement. Based on the terms of these
agreements, the district court explained that “a reasonable
person viewing those disclosures would understand that
Google maintains the practices of (a) collecting its users’
data when users use Google services or third party sites that
use Google’s services and (b) that Google uses the data for
advertising purposes.”
    Finally, the district court rejected Plaintiffs’ arguments
to the contrary. Most notably, the district court held that the
Chrome Privacy Notice did “not negate []” Plaintiffs’
consent to the general policies outlined above. The district

     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW
    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We
review de novo the district court’s summary judgment order.
2-Bar Ranch Ltd. P’ship v. U.S. Forest Serv., 996 F.3d 984,
990 (9th Cir. 2021).
                            ANALYSIS
    At summary judgment, the following causes of action
remained: (1) violation of the California Invasion of Privacy
Act; (2) intrusion upon seclusion; (3) breach of contract;
(4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (5) statutory larceny; and (6) violation of
California’s Unfair Competition Law. The parties do not
dispute that consent is a valid defense to these claims, and
that the contours of the defense as established in the
Restatement (Second) of Torts. 10 and in state law are as
follows.
    First, consent “can be [express] or implied, but any
consent must be actual.” In re Google Inc., No. 13-MD-
02430-LHK, 2013 WL 5423918, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26,
2013) (citing United States v. Van Poyck, 77 F.3d 285, 292(9th Cir. 1996)); see also Pinnacle Museum Tower Ass’n v.
Pinnacle Mkt. Dev. (US), LLC, 282 P.3d 1217, 1224 (Cal.
2012) (stating that general principles of contract law include


9
 The district court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification as
moot.
 California courts are generally guided by the principles outlined in the
10

Restatement (Second) of Torts. See, e.g., Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed
Martin Corp., 63 P.3d 937, 951 (Cal. 2003).
                   CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                  15


express or implied consent). For consent to be actual, the
disclosures must “explicitly notify” users of the conduct at
issue. In re Google Inc., 2013 WL 5423918, at *13.
Moreover, “[c]onsent is only effective if the person alleging
harm consented ‘to the particular conduct, or to substantially
the same conduct’ and if the alleged tortfeasor did not exceed
the scope of that consent.” Tsao v. Desert Palace, Inc., 
698F.3d 1128, 1149 (9th Cir. 2012) (“To be effective, consent
must be . . . to the particular conduct, or substantially the
same conduct.”) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts
§ 892A(2)(b) (1979))).
    The parties agree that consent is “an affirmative defense
for which defendant bears the burden of proof.” Van Patten
v. Vertical Fitness Grp., LLC, 847 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir.
2017). In determining consent, courts consider “whether the
circumstances, considered as a whole, demonstrate that a
reasonable person understood that an action would be carried
out so that their acquiescence demonstrates knowing
authorization.” Smith v. Facebook, Inc., 745 F. App’x 8, 8
(9th Cir. 2018). See, e.g., Long v. Provide Com., Inc., 
200Cal. Rptr. 3d 117, 125 (Ct. App. 2016) (disagreeing that a
“hyperlink was sufficiently conspicuous to ‘put a reasonable
user on notice of the Terms of Use’”). If that user could have
plausibly understood the disclosures “as not disclosing that
[the defendant] would engage in particular conduct,” then
the disclosures are insufficient to establish consent. In re
Facebook, Inc., Consumer Priv. User Profile Litig., 402 F.
Supp. 3d 767, 789 (N.D. Cal. 2019).
    Before the district court, Plaintiffs had argued that they
did not consent to Google’s conduct because a reasonable
user viewing the disclosures would not have concluded that
they unambiguously disclosed the data collection at issue.
See, e.g., Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Summary Judgment,
16                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


Calhoun v. Google, 5:20-cv-05146, at 5-6 (Jan. 2, 2022).
Specifically, Plaintiffs asserted that the explicit statements
in the Chrome Privacy Notice would actually give a
reasonable user the opposite impression regarding Google’s
data collection practices. Further, Plaintiffs argued that—to
the extent Google relied on the Privacy Policy to argue
otherwise—that Policy also contained statements in favor of
Plaintiffs’ interpretation, such as: “the activity information
we collect may include . . . Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account,” and “[y]our Chrome
browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve
enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google
Account.”
    Google argues that the General Privacy Policy addresses
the “at-issue” data, such as IP addresses and cookies, while
the Chrome Privacy Notice reference to “personal
information” addresses only Sync-enabled data like
browsing history, bookmarks, tabs, passwords and autofill
information, and other browser settings. But the parties
dispute whether a reasonable person would understand, in
the context of all of Google’s representations in its privacy
policies, what “personal information” means.
    Plaintiffs also argue that Google’s Chrome Privacy
Notice also makes representations about data collection
beyond Sync-enabled data. For example, the Chrome
Privacy Notice states that “[y]ou don’t need to provide any
personal information to use Chrome” and that “[p]rivacy
practices are different depending on the mode you’re using.”
It goes on to state that in “Basic browser mode,” information
such as passwords and “cookies or data from websites that
you visit” are stored locally on a user’s system. The Notice
then provides that “[t]he personal information that Chrome
stores won’t be sent to Google unless you . . . turn[] on
                   CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                    17


sync.” Although Google argues that the reference to
“personal information” is sufficient to indicate which subset
of data the Notice controls, together, these statements could
suggest that the “personal information” the Chrome Privacy
Notice addresses includes cookies and IP addresses.
    Based on these arguments, the district court should have
reviewed the terms of the various disclosures and decided
whether a reasonable user reading them would think that he
or she was consenting to the data collection, which collection
Google has not disputed. See, e.g., In re Facebook, Inc.
Internet Tracking Litig., 956 F.3d 589, 602 (9th Cir. 2020)
(identifying “the relevant question” as “whether a user
would reasonably expect that Facebook would have access
to the user’s individual data,” and reviewing the terms of
“Facebook’s privacy disclosures” to answer that question).
    However, rather than trying to determine how a
reasonable user would understand Google’s various privacy
policies, the district court held a 7.5-hour evidentiary hearing
which included expert testimony about “whether the data-
collection at issue [is] . . . browser-agnostic.” The district
court thus made the case turn on a technical distinction
unfamiliar to most “reasonable user[s].” If “the data
collection at-issue [wa]s specific to Chrome,” the court
believed, then the Chrome-specific promises in the Chrome
Privacy Notice applied. But if it was “browser-agnostic”—
if Google collected the same data from non-Chrome
browsers—then all that mattered were the company’s
generalized statements in the terms of service and Privacy
Policy.
    Having determined that the data collection was “browser
agnostic,” the district court held that Plaintiffs consented to
this collection when they agreed to Google’s general privacy
18                    CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


policies, because under the “browser agnostic terms” of
those policies, the data collection was disclosed. The district
court therefore did not consider the terms of the Chrome
Policy Notice in its analysis. To the extent the district court
considered those terms at all, it only mentioned them to say
they did not “negate” Plaintiffs’ consent.
    By focusing on “browser agnosticism” instead of
conducting the reasonable person inquiry, the district court
failed to apply the correct standard, despite its recitation of
it. Viewing this in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs,
browser agnosticism is irrelevant because nothing in
Google’s disclosures is tied to what other browsers do. And
that is because the governing standard is what a “reasonable
user” of a service would understand they were consenting to,
not what a technical expert would.
    To resist this conclusion, Google cites our unpublished
decision in Smith to argue that the district court did not err.
The Smith panel held that “[a] reasonable person viewing
[Facebook’s] disclosures would understand that Facebook
maintains” certain data collection practices based on the
terms of its disclosures. 11 Smith, 745 F. App’x at 8-9.
Google argues that the reasoning in Smith applies here
because “[t]he transmissions at issue in Smith were
materially indistinguishable from those in this case.”



11
  The relevant disclosure in Smith stated: “We collect information when
you visit or use third-party websites and apps that use our Services . . .
This includes information about the websites and apps you visit, your
use of our Services on those websites and apps, as well as information
the developer or publisher of the app or website provides to you or us,”
and “we use all of the information we have about you to show you
relevant ads.” Smith, 745 F. App’x at 8.
                      CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                           19


    But the panel in Smith did not hold that plaintiffs
consented to the data collection because it determined that
the data collection at issue was “agnostic.” Rather, it held
that plaintiffs consented to the data collection because,
analyzing the terms of Facebook’s Terms and Policies, “a
reasonable person viewing those disclosures would
understand” that Facebook engaged in the contested
practices. Id.
    More to the point, Smith, and our recent unpublished
decision in Hammerling v. Google, LLC, No. 22-17024,
2024 WL 937247, at *2 (9th Cir. Mar. 5, 2024) 12 are
inapposite, because plaintiffs in those cases had not argued
that Facebook or Google had service-specific privacy
policies that could reasonably be read to say the opposite of
what its general privacy policies disclosed. The panel in
Smith, for example, specifically explained that Facebook
was not bound by the contrary assurances of other websites’
policies because “Facebook’s Terms and Policies make no
such assurance, and Facebook is not bound by promises it
did not make.” Smith, 745 F. App’x at 9. By contrast, and
at least in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, Google did
make a promise in its Chrome Privacy Policy that it would
not collect certain information absent a user’s voluntary
decision to sync, so Google may be “bound by [those]
promises.” Id.
    Google’s “affirmative statement that it would not receive
information” in its Chrome Privacy Notice puts this case
more in line with Internet Tracking Litigation than with
Smith or Hammerling. Internet Tracking Litig., 956 F.3d at
603. There, a panel of our court reversed a district court’s

12
  Google filed a 28(j) letter notifying the court about this March 4, 2024
unpublished decision.
20                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


decision to dismiss a complaint in which users of Facebook
alleged that the social media site continued to collect their
data even after they had logged out. Id. at 596. The panel
began by assessing “whether a user would reasonably expect
that Facebook would have access to the user’s individual
data after the user logged out of the application.” Id. at 602.
It did this by reviewing Facebook’s various “privacy
disclosures” id., rather than looking at browser agnosticism.
    The panel noted that Facebook’s general Data Use Policy
stated that Facebook “receive[s] data whenever you visit a
game, application or website that uses [Facebook’s
services].” Id. To the extent the policy mentioned log in/log
out, it stated that the data collection could include “the date
and time you visit the site; the web address, . . . and, if you
are logged in to Facebook, your user ID.” Id. (emphasis
omitted). The panel also noted that Facebook’s “Help
Center” answered the more specific question of data
collection at log in/log out: “[i]f you are logged into
Facebook, we also see your user ID number and email
address. . . . If you log out of Facebook, we will not receive
this information about partner websites but you will also not
see personalized experiences on these sites.” Id. Based on
these disclosures—including the applicable Help Center
page which “affirmatively stated that logged-out user data
would not be collected,”—the panel held that a reasonable
user would not necessarily expect that Facebook would have
access to the data after logging out of the site. Id.
    Discussing other cases on this topic, the panel noted:
“[t]hat users in those cases explicitly denied consent does not
render those cases distinguishable from the instant case,
given Facebook’s affirmative statements that it would not
receive information from third-party websites after users had
logged out. Indeed, in those cases, the critical fact was that
                    CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                    21


the online entity represented to the plaintiffs that their
information would not be collected, but then proceeded to
collect it anyway.” Id. at 603 (discussing In re Google Inc.
Cookie Placement Consumer Priv. Litig., 
806 F.3d 125, 129,151 (3d Cir. 2015) and In re Nickelodeon Cons. Priv. Litig.,
827 F.3d 262, 293–94 (3d Cir. 2016)).
    Here, Google’s general Privacy Policy broadly states
“that Google collects data about users’ ‘[a]ctivity on third-
party sites and apps that use [Google’s] services.’”
Hammerling, 2024 WL 937247, at *1 (analyzing same
Privacy Policy). Like the general policy in Facebook which
only briefly discussed the log in/log out distinction, the
Privacy Policy here only briefly mentions the sync/non-sync
distinction. Like the “Help Center” in Facebook, the
Chrome Privacy Notice includes more detail on the
distinctions between Chrome browsing modes, and includes
an “affirmative statement[] that it would not receive
information,” Internet Tracking Litig., 956 F.3d at 603, from
users “unless you choose to . . . turn[] on sync.” Thus, when
the disclosures are read together and in the light most
favorable to Plaintiffs, a reasonable user would not
necessarily understand that they were consenting to the data
collection at issue. It was the district court’s failure to apply
the correct standard that led to the opposite conclusion.
    This point is illustrated by the outcome of a related case,
Brown v. Google LLC, 685 F. Supp. 3d 909, 930 (N.D. Cal.
2023). In Brown, the same district court presided over a
related class action lawsuit brought by users of Google
Chrome’s “incognito” mode. Id. at 919. As in this case,
plaintiffs alleged that Google surreptitiously collected their
data, notwithstanding statements in the same Chrome
Privacy Notice (and on the incognito splash screen) that
within Incognito mode “Chrome won’t store certain
22                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


information.” Id. at 930. As in this case, Google asserted
that the Brown plaintiffs consented to the Privacy Policy,
which Policy disclosed the data collection challenged. Id. at
926.
     But unlike in this case, the district court rejected
Google’s “agnosticism” reasoning, instead properly turning
to the disclosures at issue and assessing whether a reasonable
user reading them might believe they were consenting to
certain practices. Brown, 685 F. Supp. 3d at 927-28.
    Here, Google had a general privacy disclosure yet
promoted Chrome by suggesting that certain information
would not be sent to Google unless a user turned on sync.
Thus, “Google itself created a situation where there is a
dispute as to whether users’ consent of Google’s data
collection generally is ‘substantially the same’ as their
consent to the collection of their [non-synced] data in
particular.” Id. at 928.
    Whether a “reasonable” user of Google’s computer
software at issue in this case consented to a particular data
collection practice is not to be determined by attributing to
that user the skill of an experienced business lawyer or
someone who is able to easily ferret through a labyrinth of
legal jargon to understand what he or she is consenting to.
Instead, a determination of what a “reasonable” user would
have understood must take into account the level of
sophistication attributable to the general public, which uses
Google’s services.
    Because applying the correct standard reveals disputes
of material fact regarding whether “reasonable” users of
Google’s product consented to Google’s data collection
practices, the issue of consent—assuming a plaintiff class is
certified—is remanded to the district court for trial.

                   ______________________

     Before REYNA, HUGHES, and STOLL, Circuit Judges.
     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge STOLL.
 Opinion dissenting in part filed by Circuit Judge HUGHES.
 STOLL, Circuit Judge.
     Sholem Weisner appeals from the district court’s dis-
 missal of his patent infringement suit under Federal Rule
 of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court held all of the
 asserted claims ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101. We af-
 firm-in-part and reverse-in-part.
                         BACKGROUND
                               I
     Mr. Weisner—a named inventor of U.S. Patent Nos.
 10,380,202, 10,642,910, 10,394,905 and 10,642,911—sued
 Google LLC for patent infringement in the United States
 District Court for the Southern District of New York.
     The four asserted patents are related and share a com-
 mon specification. 1 The shared specification generally de-
 scribes ways to “digitally record a person’s physical
 activities” and ways to use this digital record. ’202 patent,
 Abstract. Specifically, it describes a way in which individ-
 uals and businesses can sign up for a system so that they
 can exchange information, for instance “a URL or an elec-
 tronic business card.” Id. at col. 3 ll. 30–36. Then, as indi-
 viduals go about their day, they may encounter people or
 businesses that they want recorded in their “leg history,”
 which records the URLs or business cards along with the
 time and place of the encounters. Id. at col. 3 l. 48–col. 4


     1   Because the specifications are identical, we refer
 only to the ’202 patent specification unless otherwise spec-
 ified.

 l. 23; see also id. at Fig. 8. The specification describes a “leg
 history” as “the accumulation of a digital record of a per-
 son’s physical presence across time.” Id. at col. 1 ll. 6–10.
      Individuals record entries in their travel history either
 by accepting a proposal from another person/business (e.g.,
 by “push[ing] a button”), or by unilaterally making an en-
 try (e.g., by “tak[ing] a snapshot with a digital camera . . .
 and upload[ing] it to [their] databank”). Id. at col. 3
 l. 48–col. 4 l. 11. These methods are illustrated in Figure 3
 (showing a user accepting a proposed entry by “Macy’s”)
 and Figure 4 (showing a user unilaterally making an entry
 at “Benson’s” by taking a photograph):

 Id. at Figs. 3–4; see also id. at col. 11 l. 20–col. 13 l. 18.
      The specification also describes using this collected
 travel history data to “enhance web searching results.” Id. at col. 17 ll. 9–13. For example, the specification describes
 a method for enhancing search results by using a “useful
 person”—someone that has visited a location in common
 with the searching person. Id. at col. 17 l. 53–col. 18 l. 35;
 see also id. at col. 19 l. 27–col. 20 l. 61. As illustrated in
 Figure 9, in response to a person’s search, the system cross-
 references the digital histories of the searching person and
 the useful person to establish a common visit (e.g.,
 “www.fourseasons.com” in Figure 9) and then gives prior-
 ity to those search results that are found in the useful per-
 son’s travel history (e.g., “www.vegassteakhouse.com” in
 Figure 9):

 Id. at Fig. 9.
      Although the patents share a common specification,
 the claims are meaningfully different in their focus. Inde-
 pendent claim 1 of the ’202 patent recites recording “phys-
 ical location histories” of “individual member[s]” that visit
 “stationary vendor member[s]” in a “member network.” Id. at col. 21 ll. 13–67 (claim 1). In claim 1, the “physical en-
 counter” entry is proposed by the stationary vendor “auto-
 matic[ally]” and is recorded “upon acceptance by the

 handheld mobile communication device of the individual
 member.” Id. An example of such a system is shown in
 Figure 3, above.
     Claim 1 also recites a variety of other generic hardware
 and software components and features, such as a “telecom-
 munications network,” “database,” “application,” “position-
 ing system,” “handheld mobile communication device,”
 “URL,” a “searchable” “physical encounter history,” and a
 “visual timeline.” Id. The full claim is lengthy:
     1. A method of creating and/or using physical loca-
        tion histories, comprising:
       maintaining a processing system that is con-
        nected to a telecommunications network and
        configured to provide an account to an individ-
        ual member and to a stationary vendor mem-
        ber of a member network;
       providing an application that configures a
         handheld mobile communication device of
         each individual member of a member network
         to, upon instances of a physical encounter be-
         tween the individual member and the station-
         ary vendor member of a plurality of stationary
         vendor members of the member network at a
         physical premises of the stationary vendor
         member, a location of the physical encounter
         determined by a positioning system in com-
         munication with either the handheld mobile
         communication device or a communication de-
         vice of the stationary vendor member, and
         upon acceptance by the handheld mobile com-
         munication device of the individual member of
         an automatic proposal from the stationary
         vendor member, transmit a URL of the sta-
         tionary vendor member and a URL of the in-
         dividual member to the processing system
         automatically, thereby generating a location

           history entry, in at least the account of the in-
           dividual member, that includes (i) the URL of,
           and a location of, the stationary vendor mem-
           ber, (ii) a time and date of the physical en-
           counter, and (iii) an identity or the account of
           the individual member and of the stationary
           vendor member,
       the URL of the individual member associated
         with the individual member before the physi-
         cal encounter between the individual member
         and the stationary vendor member;
       the application maintaining a viewable physical
         encounter history on the handheld mobile
         communication device that includes URLs
         from multiple stationary vendor members and
         is searchable from the handheld mobile com-
         munication device (i) by URL of the individual
         member and of the stationary vendor mem-
         ber, (ii) by geographic location, and (iii) by
         time of the physical encounter,
       maintaining, using the processing system, a da-
        tabase of physical encounter histories of mem-
        bers of the member network whose accounts
        received the location history entry that was
        generated during the physical encounters, the
        individual member’s account having data
        transfer privileges that allow the physical en-
        counter history to be accumulated through
        transmission of location history entries from
        multiple handheld mobile communication de-
        vices of the individual member over time; and
       wherein the physical encounter history of a par-
         ticular individual member includes at least
         one visual timeline of physical encounters of
         the particular individual member.

 Id. at col. 21 ll. 13–67.
      Claim 1 of the ’910 patent is similar. It, too, describes
 “accumulation of physical location histories.” ’910 patent
 col. 21 ll. 16–61. It likewise recites generic features such
 as an “application,” “handheld mobile communication de-
 vice,” “database,” etc. Id. The ’910 patent’s recited method,
 however, involves “capture by the particular individual
 member” that is processed “automatically.” Id. In other
 words, the location history is recorded based on the initia-
 tive of the individual choosing to record entries, rather
 than in response to an individual “accept[ing]” an auto-
 matic proposition by a vendor as in claim 1 of the ’202 pa-
 tent. See id.      The representative claims of the remaining two pa-
 tents have a different focus: using physical location histo-
 ries to improve computerized search results. For instance,
 the preamble of claim 1 of the ’911 patent recites “enhanc-
 ing digital search results . . . using URLs of location histo-
 ries.” ’911 patent col. 21 ll. 14–53 (claim 1). The preamble
 to claim 1 of the ’905 patent likewise recites “combining en-
 hanced computerized searching . . . with use of humans as
 physical encounter links.” ’905 patent col. 21 ll. 15–63
 (claim 1). The claims then recite a number of steps for ac-
 cumulating physical location histories (similar to the ’202
 and ’911 patents) but then also include steps related to
 computerized searches using these histories. Because we
 will discuss claim 1 of both the ’911 and ’905 patents in the
 analysis below, we repeat the claim language in full here:
     1. A computer-implemented method of enhancing
        digital search results for a business in a target
        geographic area using URLs of location histo-
        ries, comprising:
        providing, by at least one processing system in
          communication with a positioning system, an
          account to (i) an individual member and (ii) a
          stationary vendor member, of a member

           the individual member’s account associated
           with a mobile communication device or multi-
           ple mobile communication devices,
       maintaining a communication link between the
        mobile communication device and the at least
        one processing system or the positioning sys-
        tem such that the mobile communication de-
        vice is configured to accumulate a location
        history on a database maintained by the at
        least one processing system from physical en-
        counters by the individual member at multi-
        ple stationary vendor members upon the
        mobile communication device being set to en-
        ter instances of a physical encounter between
        the individual member carrying the mobile
        communication device and the stationary ven-
        dor member at a physical premises of the sta-
        tionary vendor member, the positioning
        system determining a location of the individ-
        ual member at the physical premises;
       for each individual member having a location
          history who sends a search query to a search
          engine of the at least one processing system,

           (1) searching, by the search engine, the data-
           base for URLs of stationary vendor members
           in the location history, the location history
           also identifying time and geographic place of
           the physical encounters therein, and
           (2) assigning a priority, by the at least one
           processing system, in a search result ranking
           based on an appearance of one of the station-
           ary vendor member URLs in the location his-

          member of a plurality of stationary vendor
          members of the member network at a physical
          premises of the stationary vendor member, to
          transmit key data of the stationary vendor

     Mr. Weisner filed suit on April 6, 2020, in the Southern
 District of New York. At first, Mr. Weisner alleged in-
 fringement of only the ’202 patent. J.A. 3023–31 (Com-
 plaint). But he voluntarily amended his complaint on

 complaint—to add allegations of infringement of the other
 three patents. J.A. 3032–61 (First Amended Complaint).
     Google moved to dismiss Mr. Weisner’s First Amended
 Complaint on two alternative bases. First, Google argued
 that the asserted patent claims are ineligible under
 35 U.S.C. § 101. Second, Google argued that Mr. Weisner
 had failed to meet the minimum threshold for plausibly
 pleading his claim of patent infringement under Bell Atlan-
 tic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v.
 Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). The district court granted dis-
 missal on the Twombly / Iqbal basis on January 4, 2021.
 J.A. 12–14. It then held a hearing the next day to discuss
 patent eligibility. J.A. 2001–25 (Hr’g Tr.). After the hear-
 ing, the district court also granted dismissal based on inel-
 igibility under § 101 in a short, one-paragraph order.
 J.A. 15. In that same order, the district court provided
 Mr. Weisner an opportunity to file an amended complaint.
 Id.
     Mr. Weisner filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC),
 adding allegations of infringement and allegations related
 to patent eligibility. J.A. 2026–55. Relevant to this appeal,
 Mr. Weisner added a section entitled “Invention Back-
 ground and System Details Explained.” J.A. 2028–33 (SAC
 ¶¶ 11–30). Google again moved to dismiss the SAC based
 on both § 101 and Twombly / Iqbal. The district court
 granted dismissal based on § 101 without another hearing.

 citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; and then citing Johnson
 v. Priceline.com, Inc., 711 F.3d 271, 275 (2d Cir. 2013)).
      Patent eligibility under § 101 is a question of law that
 may involve underlying questions of fact. Interval Licens-
 ing LLC v. AOL, Inc., 896 F.3d 1335, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2018)
 (citing Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018)). We review a district court’s ultimate con-
 clusion on patent eligibility de novo. Id. We have held that
 “[p]atent eligibility can be determined on the pleadings . . .
 when there are no factual allegations that, when taken as
 true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter
 of law.” Data Engine Techs. LLC v. Google LLC, 
906F.3d 999, 1007 (Fed. Cir. 2018).
      Section 101 defines patent-eligible subject matter as
 “any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or
 composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
 thereof.” 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Supreme Court established
 a two-step test for examining patent eligibility under § 101
 in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. 208 (2014). Under step one, we “determine whether the claims
 at issue are directed to . . . [a] patent-ineligible concept[,]”
 such as an abstract idea. Id. at 217 (quoting Mayo Collab-
 orative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab’ys, Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 77–
 79 (2012)). Under step two, we “consider the elements of
 each claim both individually and ‘as an ordered combina-
 tion’ to determine whether the additional elements ‘trans-
 form the nature of the claim’ into a patent-eligible
 application.” Id. Step two is “a search for an ‘inventive
 concept’—i.e., an element or combination of elements that
 is ‘sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts
 to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible

 concept] itself.’” Id. at 217–18 (alteration in original) (quot-
 ing Mayo, 566 U.S. at 72).
                                I
     We start with the ’202 and ’910 patents. We determine
 the challenged claims of these patents are patent ineligible,
 and thus we affirm the district court’s dismissal as to the
 claims of these two patents.
                                A
     At step one of Alice, we agree with the district court
 that the representative claims2 of these patents are di-
 rected to an abstract idea. The district court correctly de-
 termined that the patent claims are directed to “collect[ing]
 information on a user’s movements and location history
 [and] electronically record[ing] that data.” Weisner, 551
 F. Supp. 3d at 339. Put more simply, the claims are di-
 rected to creating a digital travel log.
     The claim language supports our conclusion that the
 claims are directed to creating a digital travel log. For in-
 stance, the preamble of claim 1 of the ’202 patent recites
 “creating and/or using physical location histories.” ’202 pa-
 tent col. 21 ll. 13–14. The steps in the body of the claim
 describe a generic process for achieving the goal of creating


      2  Although Mr. Weisner argues on appeal that a
 number of claims are “exemplary,” Appellant’s Br. 20, 28,
 32, 37, he only describes and analyzes claim 1 of each pa-
 tent in any significant detail. Accordingly, we treat claim
 1 of each patent as representative.
     Mr. Weisner briefly mentions claim 3 of the ’202 patent
 in two short paragraphs of his opening brief. Appellant’s
 Br. 57, 59; see also Appellant’s Reply Br. 26. To the extent
 that this was sufficient to preserve his argument, we also
 determine that claim 3 is ineligible for the reasons de-
 scribed below. See infra at 25 n.4.
Case: 21-2228    Document: 62      Page: 15     Filed: 10/13/2022




 WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC                                     15



 a digital travel log, such as “maintaining a processing sys-
 tem” and using an “application” to generate a user’s “loca-
 tion history entry” on their “handheld mobile
 communication device.” Id. at col. 23 ll. 15–67. The pre-
 amble to claim 1 of the ’910 patent likewise recites a
 “method for accumulation of physical location histories.”
 ’910 patent col. 21 ll. 16–19. And again, the body of the
 claim recites generic features like a “processing system
 that is connected to a telecommunications network,” a
 “URL,” and a “handheld mobile communication device.” Id.
 at col. 21 ll. 20–61.
      Mr. Weisner does little to combat the district court’s ar-
 ticulation of what the claims are directed to for these two
 particular patents. Indeed, Mr. Weisner’s opening brief
 states that “[t]he method of claim 1 of the ’202 patent is
 directed to the creation and use of physical location histo-
 ries.” Appellant’s Br. 37. Likewise, Mr. Weisner’s own al-
 legations in the SAC of what the patents are “generally
 directed to” also support our conclusion that the claims are
 directed to creating a digital travel log. For instance,
 Mr. Weisner states that “[t]he ’202 Patent is generally di-
 rected to a method and system of creating and/or using
 physical location histories.” J.A. 2035–36 (SAC ¶ 34). Sim-
 ilarly, for the ’910 patent, Mr. Weisner alleges that patent
 “is generally directed to a method, system and computer-
 readable medium for accumulating physical location histo-
 ries based on digital member entries using a URL or an
 identifier associated with a URL.” J.A. 2044 (SAC ¶ 52).
      Both the Supreme Court and this court’s precedent
 suggest that claims purporting to improve “the functioning
 of the computer itself” or “an existing technological pro-
 cess” might not be directed to an abstract idea. Alice, 573
 U.S. at 225; Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 
822 F.3d 1327,1335 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Based on this precedent, Mr. Weis-
 ner asserts that claim 1 is not abstract, but rather “im-
 proves the functionality of the underlying system” by
 “[1] automatically recording physical interactions and

 [2] limiting what is recorded to only specific types of inter-
 actions that are pre-approved and agreed to by an individ-
 ual member and a vendor member.” See, e.g., Appellant’s
 Br. 57. As the district court correctly observed, however,
 “[h]umans have consistently kept records of a person’s lo-
 cation and travel in the form of travel logs, diaries, jour-
 nals, and calendars, which compile information such as
 time and location.” Weisner, 551 F. Supp. 3d at 339. Auto-
 mation or digitization of a conventional method of organiz-
 ing human activity like the creation of a travel log on a
 computer does not bring the claims out of the realm of ab-
 stractness. See Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Westlake Servs.,
 859 F.3d 1044, 1055 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (“[M]ere automation
 of manual processes using generic computers does not con-
 stitute a patentable improvement in computer technol-
 ogy.”); Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells
 Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 776 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir.
 2014) (“The concept of data collection, recognition, and
 storage is undisputedly well-known.”).
     Likewise, the fact that the claims recite a number of
 generic elements—including a processing system, an appli-
 cation, and a handheld mobile communication device—
 does not shift their focus away from the core idea of creat-
 ing a digital travel log. “[S]imply appending conventional
 steps, specified at a high level of generality, to . . . abstract
 ideas cannot make those . . . ideas patentable.” Mayo, 
566U.S. at 82; see also Affinity Labs of Tex., LLC v. Ama-
 zon.com Inc., 838 F.3d 1266, 1272 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (“The
 addition of basic user customization features to the inter-
 face does not alter the abstract nature of the claims . . . .”).
     Finally, Mr. Weisner’s last counterpoint—that the
 claims are not abstract because they are directed to only
 capturing the travel history of “members”—is not persua-
 sive. Appellant’s Br. 56–58. According to Mr. Weisner, this
 improves the “integrity” of the data and avoids an “inunda-
 tion of information making it useless.” Id. at 56–58. But
 these purported technological advantages are nothing

 WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC                                    17



 more than attorney argument, unlinked to the complaint
 or the patent claims or specification. Indeed, neither the
 specification nor the SAC addresses this purported techno-
 logical improvement. Although the claims do recite a
 “member of the member network” and other “member” lim-
 itations, they do not limit the data collection to only mem-
 bers. ’202 patent col. 21 ll. 13–67; ’910 patent col. 21
 ll. 16–61. Thus, the purported benefit of limiting data ac-
 cumulation to members is not captured in the claims and,
 accordingly, does not shift the focus of the claims away
 from the abstract idea of creating a digital travel log.
     Accordingly, we agree with the district court’s analysis
 at step one for these claims and reject Mr. Weisner’s argu-
 ments to the contrary. Having concluded that the repre-
 sentative claims for the ’202 and ’910 patents are directed
 to an abstract idea, we proceed to step two.
                               B
      Turning to step two, we consider the elements of each
 claim both individually and “as an ordered combination” to
 determine whether the claims recite “something more”
 than the abstract idea to transform the nature of the claim
 into a patent-eligible application. See Alice, 573 U.S. at 217
 (quoting Mayo, 566 U.S. at 77–80). We conclude that the
 district court appropriately relied on statements in the
 specification and concessions by the patentee to conclude
 that the claims “rely on the use of existing technology to
 create a computerized version of [travel] logs and do not
 ‘focus on a specific means or method that improves the rel-
 evant technology.’” Weisner, 551 F. Supp. 3d at 340 (quot-
 ing Apple, Inc. v. Ameranth, Inc., 842 F.3d 1229, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2016)).
     As the district court appropriately determined, the
 specification describes the components and features listed
 in the claims generically, supporting the conclusion that
 these components and features are conventional, not in-
 ventive concepts in the patents. See ’202 patent col. 8

 ll. 32–42 (describing the “software 89” for implementing
 the invention on a mobile device as being “content [that] is
 known to those skilled in the art of computer science” and
 which “can be readily developed or is already known to
 those skilled in the art”), col. 8 ll. 38–40 (describing meth-
 ods to “receive and transmit wirelessly” including “methods
 such as Bluetooth®”), col. 8 ll. 43–60 (explaining that
 “handheld electronic network device 22” includes “any
 other handheld electronic device that is typically carried
 around by people during their day including IPods, cellular
 telephones, [etc.]”), col. 8 ll. 61–64 (generically describing
 having a customer “sign up at a web site” to become “a
 member of the network”), col. 11 ll. 44–46 (explaining that
 the “telecommunications network” is typically “a global
 network such as the world wide web”), col 15 ll. 44–50 (ref-
 erencing a generic “GPS or other navigational system” to
 create a “geographical place stamp”). We agree with the
 district court that these claims do not recite significantly
 more than the abstract idea of digitizing a travel log using
 conventional components.
     Mr. Weisner again argues that the claim limitations di-
 rected to “members” provide the something more to trans-
 form the claims into a patent-eligible invention.
 Appellant’s Br. 54–55, 58–59; Appellant’s Reply Br. 22–24.
 As explained above, however, this argument is not linked
 to the claims.
     For these reasons, we agree with the district court’s
 conclusion that the asserted claims of the ’202 and ’910 pa-
 tents are ineligible under § 101, and therefore affirm the
 district court’s dismissal as to these claims.
                               II
     We turn next to the ’905 and ’911 patents. We deter-
 mine the challenged claims of these patents have not been
 shown to be ineligible at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, where the
 court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as
 true and must construe all reasonable inferences in favor

 of Mr. Weisner. Thus, we reverse the district court’s dis-
 missal as to the claims of these two patents.
                               A
     At step one, the district court erred by failing to sepa-
 rately analyze these patents. Although the specifications
 in all four patents are the same, the claims of the ’905 and
 ’911 patents are not directed to the same subject matter as
 the ’202 and ’910 patents. Rather, at step one, we conclude
 that the representative claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents
 are directed to creating and using travel histories to im-
 prove computerized search results.
      The claim language supports this focus. In contrast
 with the preambles of claim 1 of both the ’202 and ’910 pa-
 tents, which focus on creating the location histories, the
 preamble to claim 1 of the ’911 patent recites a “method of
 enhancing digital search results for a business in a target
 geographic area using URLs of location histories.” ’911 pa-
 tent col. 21 ll. 14–16. Similarly, the preamble to claim 1 of
 the ’905 patent recites a “method of combining enhanced
 computerized searching for a target business with use of
 humans as physical encounter links.” ’905 patent col. 21
 ll. 15–17. The bodies of the ’905 and ’911 patent claims also
 support this emphasis. They first describe accumulation of
 physical location histories in a highly generic fashion, and
 then, in more detail, describe the use of the location histo-
 ries in digital searches. ’905 patent col. 21 ll. 18–37 (first
 half of claim 1 describing generating a database of physical
 location histories), col. 21 ll. 38–63 (second half describing
 using the physical location histories in response to a
 “search query”); ’911 patent col. 21 ll. 17–37 (first half of
 claim 1 describing “accumulat[ing] a location history on a
 database”); col. 21 ll. 38–53 (second half describing using
 that information in a “search query”).
     The specification also supports this emphasis on using
 location histories in computerized searching as a distinct
 concept from mere accumulation of location histories. For
Case: 21-2228    Document: 62      Page: 20    Filed: 10/13/2022

 instance, the background of the invention lists certain as-
 pects of searching on the world wide web as “[a]nother
 problem” that the patent is directed to solving. ’905 patent
 col. 2 ll. 47–62. Similarly, the “Summary of the Present In-
 vention” emphasizes an “improved method of searching the
 world wide web . . . that makes use of digital histories.” Id.
 at col. 4 ll. 36–38. Finally, the detailed description of the
 invention includes a section describing “Using Digital His-
 tories to Improve Search Results.” Id. at col. 17 l. 8–col. 20
 l. 67.
     Our conclusion is again supported by allegations in
 Mr. Weisner’s SAC regarding what the ’911 and ’905 pa-
 tents are “generally directed to.” See J.A. 2041 (SAC ¶ 46)
 (“The ’911 Patent is generally directed to a method and sys-
 tem of enhancing digital search results for a business in a
 target geographic area using URLs of location histo-
 ries . . . .”); J.A. 2038–39 (SAC ¶ 40) (“The ’905 Patent is
 generally directed to a method and system of combining en-
 hanced computerized searching for a target business with
 use of physical encounters between individuals having
 communications devices and vendors . . . .”).
     Whether these claims are directed to an abstract idea
 presents a much closer question than the claims in the ’202
 and ’910 patents. We ultimately conclude that the repre-
 sentative claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents are directed
 to an abstract idea, but that, on the pleadings, they satisfy
 step two of the Alice test. Thus, we proceed to step two.
                               B
     Turning to step two of Alice, we conclude that
 Mr. Weisner has plausibly alleged that the ’905 and ’911
 patent claims recite a specific implementation of the ab-
 stract idea that purports to solve a problem unique to the
 Internet and that, accordingly, these claims should not
 have been held ineligible under step two at this stage.

 WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC                                     21



     The district court rejected the claims at step two be-
 cause the “patents at issue . . . confirm that the patented
 search and data collection uses conventional techniques
 without an inventive concept.” Weisner, 551 F. Supp. 3d
 at 340. In particular, the court relied on statements from
 the SAC and specification that concede the patentee did not
 invent a new search engine algorithm. J.A. 2030 (SAC
 ¶ 18) (conceding the patented system “uses the same or
 similar algorithm used by existing search engines”); ’905
 patent col. 17 ll. 13–15. Although this means the search
 engine algorithm cannot be the inventive concept that
 saves the claims at step two, this does not doom these
 claims. As explained below, we conclude that the claims’
 specificity as to the mechanism through which they achieve
 improved search results (through a “location relationship”
 with a “reference individual” for the ’905 patent or through
 the “location history of the individual member” who is run-
 ning the search in a targeted “geographic area” for the ’911
 patent) is sufficient. Stated another way, disclosing a new
 search engine algorithm is not necessary as these claims do
 not per se concern searching for new information, but ra-
 ther concern a new technique for prioritizing the results of
 the conventional search. 3
    Claim 1 of the ’905 patent plausibly captures an in-
 ventive concept in the form of a specific technique for using



     3   The dissent also echoes this same paragraph of the
 SAC and lines from the specification regarding the search
 algorithm. Dissent at 3. Like the district court’s opinion,
 this misses the point. It is not the algorithm itself that is
 alleged to be unconventional in the SAC. Rather, the SAC
 and the patent specification allege that it is the specific im-
 plementations for using the travel histories to prioritize the
 order of the search results that operate differently than
 conventional methods and solve an internet-centric prob-
 lem, as further described below.
Case: 21-2228    Document: 62      Page: 22     Filed: 10/13/2022




 22                                     WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC



 physical location history data to improve computerized
 search results. In particular, claim 1 uses a “physical loca-
 tion relationship” with a third-party “reference individual”
 to increase the priority of search results. Claim 1 describes
 how the physical relationship is established—the system
 searches the physical location histories of both a reference
 individual and the searching person to determine whether
 they have visited a common location (“second stationary
 vendor member”). ’905 patent col. 21 ll. 46–56. The system
 then prioritizes search results that the reference individual
 has visited. Id. at col. 21 ll. 46–48, 61–63 (stating “the ref-
 erence individual . . . has a physical location relationship
 with the first stationary vendor member” and “increas[ing]
 a ranking of the first stationary vendor member”).
     This is more than just the concept of improving a web
 search using location history—it is a specific implementa-
 tion of that concept. Even Google recognizes the specificity
 in this process with the following diagram from its appeal
 brief “illustrat[ing] the relationships”:




 Appellee’s Br. 12.
     This specific implementation is also alleged to solve a
 problem particular to the Internet. The SAC emphasizes
 this particular aspect as “something significantly more,”
 explaining that “when a user will search for a physical lo-
 cation to visit, the inventive system will search a list of the
 physical location URLs and produce a result, based

 on: past visit of such user, and past visits of location rela-
 tives of such user.” J.A. 2031 (SAC ¶ 21). The SAC ex-
 plains this feature provides “specifically tailored result[s]
 to the searcher’s unique characteristics” and “eliminates
 the inherent bias of pushing and referring places through
 conventional web searches.” J.A. 2031–32 (SAC ¶¶ 22–23).
 The SAC explains that this is different from the conven-
 tional method, in which web searches merely defaulted to
 the “highest-ranking Uniform Resource Locator (‘URL’)
 link” by using purely “virtual encounters.” J.A. 2029 (SAC
 ¶¶ 15–16).
     Looking to the intrinsic record, the specification also
 emphasizes that conventional web searches have a problem
 of returning voluminous, generic, non-personalized search
 results. For example, the specification states that the cur-
 rent “process of searching the world wide web does not ad-
 equately take cognizance of the unique characteristics and
 tastes of the searching person.” ’905 patent col. 2 ll. 57–60.
 The solution, according to the specification, is an “improved
 method of searching the world wide web . . . that makes use
 of digital histories.” Id. at col. 4 ll. 36–38. That portion of
 the specification specifically calls out the method of using
 a “useful person” which operates the same as the “reference
 individual” of the claims. Id. at col. 4 ll. 43–55. The speci-
 fication describes this “useful person” mechanism in signif-
 icant detail. Id. at col. 17 l. 53–col. 20 l. 67. Accepting
 these factual allegations in the SAC and specification as
 true, together with all reasonable inferences, as we must
 at this stage, see Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Soft-
 ware, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1127–30 (Fed. Cir. 2018); see also
 Johnson, 711 F.3d at 275, we conclude that the claims of
 the ’905 patent include an inventive concept that suffices
 to defeat Google’s motion to dismiss.
     Claim 1 of the ’911 patent is similar, although it pre-
 sents a different solution to the problem of generic web
 search results. Claim 1 of the ’911 patent is particular to
 “search quer[ies] targeting a geographic area.” ’911 patent

 24                                    WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC



 col. 21 ll. 38–41. The claim recites searching the location
 history database for entries “in the location history of the
 individual member” conducting the geographically tar-
 geted search that fall within “the target geographic area.”
 Id. at col. 21 ll. 42–53. As described above, this implemen-
 tation is alleged in the SAC to be an inventive concept that
 improves computerized search results by taking into ac-
 count the “past visit of such user” (i.e., the particular user
 conducting the search) and “geographic location” of the
 search. J.A. 2031 (SAC ¶ 21). This is contrasted against
 the conventional method of prioritizing searches based ex-
 clusively on “virtual encounters.”           J.A. 2029 (SAC
 ¶¶ 15–16). And the claimed solution addresses the prob-
 lem of non-personalized search results described in the
 specification. ’911 patent col. 2 l. 64–col. 3 l. 2. Thus, we
 conclude that the claims of the ’911 patent also include an
 inventive concept that precludes an ineligibility determi-
 nation at the pleadings stage.
     We have previously held patent claims eligible at step
 two when they provided a specific solution to an Internet-
 centric problem. For example, the claims in DDR Hold-
 ings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2014), disclosed a system in which a visitor to a
 webpage that clicked on an advertisement on that webpage
 would not be transported to the third-party advertiser’s
 page but instead would remain within the original host’s
 webpage, allowing the host to retain web traffic. Id. at 1257–58. We explained that this provided “an inventive
 concept for resolving this particular Internet-centric prob-
 lem, rendering the claims patent-eligible.” Id. at 1259.
 And we noted that, unlike other patent claims that a pa-
 tentee argued were eligible based on an “Internet-centric
 challenge,” but that were held ineligible in Ultramercial,
 Inc. v. Hulu, LLC, 772 F.3d 709 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the
 “claims at issue [in DDR] specify how interactions with the
 Internet are manipulated to yield a desired result—a result
 that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of

 events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink.”
 DDR, 773 F.3d at 1258.
     The ’905 and ’911 patent claims are analogous to those
 we held eligible in DDR. Here, the record supports that the
 claims plausibly provide a solution to an Internet-centric
 problem regarding web searches, allowing for more person-
 alized search results than conventional methods. And like
 the claims in DDR, the claims here avoid the Ultramercial
 problem of “broadly and generically claim[ing] ‘use of the
 Internet’ to perform an abstract business practice (with in-
 significant added activity)” because they provide a “specific
 way” to solve the problem—through the “reference individ-
 ual.” Id. at 1258–59.
     Thus, we conclude that claim 1 of the ’905 patent and
 claim 1 of the ’911 patent plausibly recite inventive con-
 cepts that add significantly more to the abstract idea of us-
 ing travel histories to improve computerized search
 results. These inventive concepts are supported by allega-
 tions in the SAC as well as portions of the specification,
 which we must accept as true at the pleadings stage. See
 Aatrix, 882 F.3d at 1127–30; see also Johnson, 
711 F.3dat 275. 4



     4   Like claim 1 of both the ’905 and ’911 patents,
 claim 3 of the ’202 patent (mentioned only in passing in
 Mr. Weisner’s brief) is directed to the idea of creating and
 using travel histories to improve computerized search re-
 sults. Unlike the ’905 and ’911 patent claims, however,
 claim 3 of the ’202 patent fails to provide a “specific way”
 to solve the internet-centric problem regarding computer-
 ized search results. Instead, it recites the raw idea of using
 travel histories in a search. Claim 3 broadly describes
 “searching [] the physical encounter histories of the [loca-
 tion history] database” and “using results of the searching

                         CONCLUSION
     The district court correctly concluded that the claims
 in the ’202 and ’910 patents are ineligible under 35 U.S.C.
§ 101. Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal
 as to those patents.
     The ’905 and ’911 patent claims, in contrast, plausibly
 include more than merely the concept of improving com-
 puterized search results using travel histories. Instead,
 those claims add significantly more to that abstract idea by
 implementing a specific solution to a problem rooted in
 computer technology. Accordingly, we reverse the district
 court’s dismissal as to the claims of the ’905 and ’911 pa-
 tents.

 patent col. 22 ll. 4–7 (claim 3). It does not include any spec-
 ificity as to whose histories are being used or how they are
 being used to affect the search ranking, nor does it provide
 any mechanisms for limiting the relevant histories. It thus
 recites nothing more than the abstract idea. Accordingly,
 we determine that claim 3 of the ’202 patent is ineligible.

 HUGHES, Circuit Judge, dissenting-in-part.
      I agree with the majority that the claims of the ’202 and
 ’910 patents are ineligible. I further agree that the claims
 of the ’905 and ’911 patents are directed to the abstract idea
 of “creating and using travel histories to improve comput-
 erized search results.” I dissent-in-part because I disagree
 with Part II.B of the majority’s analysis, determining that
 the claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents recite inventive con-
 cepts. Because the second amended complaint admits that
 the algorithms used to incorporate location data are rou-
 tine and conventional, and because the claims do not solve

 a problem specific to the internet, I would affirm the dis-
 trict court’s determination that the claims of these two pa-
 tents are ineligible.
                               I
     The second amended complaint and specifications re-
 veal that the claimed methods of the ’905 and ’911 incorpo-
 rate location history into a search engine algorithm in a
 routine and conventional way: using well-understood
 methods of incorporating browsing history. Thus, all the
 claims add is the idea of using location history in a search
 engine algorithm, which is the abstract idea itself.
     At step two, we distinguish between “laws of nature,
 natural phenomena, and abstract ideas”—which are not
 themselves patentable subject matter—and inventive ap-
 plications of the abstract idea—which might be eligible.
 Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab’ys, Inc., 
566U.S. 66, 70–71 (“[A]n application of a law of nature or
 mathematical formula to a known structure or process may
 well be deserving of patent protection.” (quoting Diamond
 v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 187 (1981)). We make this distinc-
 tion by examining “the elements of the claim to determine
 whether it contains an ‘inventive concept’ sufficient to
 ‘transform’ the claimed abstract idea into a patent-eligible
 application.” Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Soft-
 ware, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1128 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting
 Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 573 U.S. 208, 221
 (2014)). “If the elements involve ‘well-understood, routine,
 [and] conventional activity previously engaged in by re-
 searchers in the field,’ they do not constitute an ‘inventive
 concept.’” Id. at 1128 (alteration in original) (quoting Mayo,
 566 U.S. at 73).
     The question of inventiveness at step two can involve
 underlying issues of fact, Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 
881 F.3d1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018), and we take the facts alleged
 in the complaint as true when considering step two on a
 motion to dismiss.

     Mr. Weisner’s second amended compliant explains
 that, “[p]rior to 2007, . . . [e]xisting search engine and
 search algorithm technology used records of virtual en-
 counters only.” Appx2029 at ¶ 15. Rather than “discern the
 most relevant physical location,” these search engines re-
 turned websites based on, among other things “the individ-
 ual’s cyber activity [and] surf history.” Appx2029 at ¶ 16.
     The claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents detail ways in
 which a search engine can use a person’s history of physical
 encounters to provide relevant search results. In the
 ’905 patent, the search engine uses location histories of
 both the “searching” person and a second “reference” per-
 son who has visited at least one of the same locations. ’905
 patent at 21:50–63. The search engine prioritizes search
 results appearing in the reference person’s location history.
 Id. at 21:46–49. In the ’911 patent, the search engine pri-
 oritizes results within the geographic area of the searching
 person’s other physical encounters. ’911 patent at 21:39–
 53.
     The second amended complaint concedes, though, that
 the claimed method “uses the same or similar algorithm
 used by existing search engines, only with physical encoun-
 ters that are now searchable online just as cyber encoun-
 ters were until now.” Appx2030 at ¶ 18. In other words, the
 claimed methods of using location history are conventional
 methods, merely reused or adapted for use with a new type
 of data—location history. This allegation accords with the
 specification, which states that “[a]lgorithms can be easily
 imagined by those skilled in the art of search engine algo-
 rithms that would improve searching.” ’905 patent
 at 17:13–15. Like search engines considered browsing his-
 tory before 2007, the claimed “search engine algorithm
 would consider the URLs in the [location] history of the
 person doing the searching.” Id. at 17:18–19.
     Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, the
 claimed methods of incorporating location data are “well-

 understood, routine, [and] conventional.” Mayo, 
566 U.S. at79 (alteration in original). The methods thus do not convert
 the abstract idea—creating and using travel histories to
 improve computerized search results—into an inventive
 application.
     Because the details of the methods are conventional,
 the only purportedly unconventional aspect of the claims is
 the use of location history in a search engine. See
 Appx2029–31 at ¶¶ 17–21 (emphasizing “obstacles” related
 to the collection of location history and the “benefits” of
 having a location history and using it for search, rather
 than any obstacles or benefits arising from the details of
 the search algorithm implementation). But using location
 history to improve search results is, as the majority con-
 cludes, the abstract idea itself. Maj. Op. 20–22. “It has been
 clear since Alice that a claimed invention’s use of the inel-
 igible concept to which it is directed cannot supply the in-
 ventive concept that renders the invention ‘significantly
 more’ than that ineligible concept.” BSG Tech LLC v.
 Buyseasons, Inc., 899 F.3d 1281, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2018).
 Thus, the ’905 and ’911 patents fail to claim an inventive
 concept adequate to save them at step two.
                               II
     DDR Holdings does not say otherwise. Although the
 claims here are limited to internet search engines, they do
 not solve an internet-specific problem.
     In DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, we upheld claims
 covering an “e-commerce outsourcing system.” 
773 F.3d1245, 1249, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2014). “On activation of a hy-
 perlink on a host website—such as an advertisement for a
 third-party merchant— . . . the system generates and di-
 rects the visitor to a composite web page that displays prod-
 uct information from the third-party merchant, but retains
 the host website’s ‘look and feel.’” Id. at 1248–49. This sys-
 tem solved the problem that “third-party merchants [could]
 ‘lure the [host website’s] visitor traffic away’ from the host

 website because visitors would be taken to the third-party
 merchant’s website when they clicked on the merchant’s
 advertisement on the host site.” Id. at 1248 (quoting U.S.
Patent No. 6,629,135 at 2:26–30) (second alteration in orig-
 inal).
     We upheld these claims at step two, distinguishing Al-
 ice and several other cases because the claims “do not
 merely recite the performance of some business practice
 known from the pre-Internet world along with the require-
 ment to perform it on the Internet.” Id. at 1257. Instead,
 “the claimed solution is necessarily rooted in computer
 technology in order to overcome a problem specifically aris-
 ing in the realm of computer networks.” Id.      The ’905 and ’911 patents purport to improve recom-
 mendations provided on the internet. See ’905 patent at
 2:47–62, 17:8; ’911 patent at 2:50–3:2. But the problem of
 overly generic recommendations predates the internet, as
 does the solution of using location information to improve
 recommendations. To get more personalized recommenda-
 tions from a travel agent, people could ask about specific
 destinations and list locations they have visited before,
 analogous to the method of the ’911 patent. To get more
 personalized restaurant recommendations, people could
 ask friends with similar tastes who have visited some of
 the same restaurants, like the ’905 patent. Cf. In re Green-
 stein, 778 F. App’x 935, 938–39 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (“[T]he
 problem of trustworthy recommendations predates the In-
 ternet” . . . “[and] is a business problem, not a technical
 one.”); Bridge & Post, Inc. v. Verizon Commc’ns, Inc., 778
F. App’x 882, 884 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (“The concept of tailoring
 advertisements based on user data . . . dates back at least
 to local radio and television advertisements, which played
 only for users located in specific cities and were published
 in-between otherwise national programs. In the computer
 context, prior art systems tracked users . . . . A user’s loca-
 tion could be approximately determined by the IP address
 of their device . . . .”). The sheer amount of non-local

 information available on the internet perhaps exacerbates
 the problem of overly generic recommendations, but this
 does not make it an internet-centric problem.
      By contrast, the claimed system in DDR “overc[a]me a
 problem specifically arising in the realm of computer net-
 works” that does not have the same close analogues in the
 physical world—one cannot be inadvertently lured away
 from a physical retail store with the press of a button. DDR,
 773 F.3d at 1257. Rather than solving a problem specifi-
 cally arising in the realm of computer networks, the
 claimed methods of the ’911 and ’905 patents “merely recite
 the performance of some business practice known from the
 pre-Internet world along with the requirement to perform
 it on the Internet.” Id.     I would find all challenged claims ineligible and re-

Before: M. Margaret McKeown, Danielle J. Forrest, and Gabriel P. Sanchez,
Circuit Judges.

      Google LLC’s Motion for a Stay of Permanent Injunction Pending Google’s

Forthcoming Petitions for Rehearing and, if Necessary, Certiorari is denied. The

request for a stay pending a petition for rehearing is moot because the court issued

an administrative stay pending decision on the petition for rehearing and the court

denied that petition on September 12, 2025.

      The Permanent Injunction (“Injunction”) was issued on October 7, 2024.

This is not a situation in which Google must comply with key provisions of the

Injunction immediately upon issuance of the mandate. Rather, the district court

recognized that a lag time between the judgment and imposition of the key

provisions of the Injunction would be appropriate. To facilitate the spirit of that




                                         2                                   24-6274
ruling, on August 1, 2025, we stayed the Injunction pending appeal, despite the

district court’s denial of Google’s motion for a stay.

      For the key provisions that Google attacks—paragraphs 11 and 12 of the

Injunction related to “restor[ing] competition in the Android app-distribution

market with the catalog-access and app-store-distribution remedies,” Op. at 40—

Google has eight months from the issuance of the mandate to comply with the

Injunction. However, by this Order we modify the Injunction to extend the time

for compliance with paragraphs 11 and 12 to ten months following issuance of the

mandate. Also, per Google’s request in its initial Emergency Motion for Partial

Stay of the Permanent Injunction, we extend the short-term compliance deadlines,

contained in paragraphs 4-7 and 9-10 of the Injunction, until thirty days after the

issuance of the mandate. (The thirty-day compliance deadline contained in

paragraph 13 remains intact.)

      Under the terms of the Injunction, either party “may request a modification

of the injunction for good cause.” This provision continues to apply except with

respect to paragraphs 11 and 12; Epic may not request a compliance deadline

shorter than the ten-month deadline imposed by this Order. Google’s motion does

not encompass paragraph 8 of the Injunction; Google has represented that it

already made the contractual changes ordered with respect to carriers and phone

manufacturers. Imposition of the verdict has already been suspended more than



                                         3                                  24-6274
twenty months since the December 2023 jury verdict in favor of Epic and almost a

year since the Permanent Injunction. We also note that Google has represented

that it will file any petition for certiorari within forty-five days of a decision on its

stay motion.

      To obtain a stay of the mandate pending certiorari under Federal Rule of

Appellate Procedure 41(d), Google is required to show 1) “a reasonable probability

that four members of the Court would consider the underlying issue sufficiently

meritorious for the grant of certiorari[;]” 2) “a significant possibility of reversal of

the lower court’s decision;” and 3) “a likelihood that irreparable harm will result if

that decision is not stayed.” White v. Florida, 458 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1982). We

recognize that Google need not demonstrate “exceptional circumstances . . . to

justify a stay,” Bryant v. Ford Motor Co., 886 F.2d 1526, 1528 (9th Cir. 1989),

because it is “often the case” that our court issues a stay pending certiorari, United

States v. Pete, 525 F. 3d 844, 850 (9th Cir. 2008).

      Although we stayed the Injunction pending appeal, in our comprehensive

sixty-seven-page opinion, our unanimous panel upheld the jury’s finding of

antitrust liability and the district court’s Injunction. We emphasize that this Order

is issued after a jury trial and multitudinous district court proceedings. Unlike

many stay orders, this Order does not relate to a stay pending issuance of a

preliminary injunction but rather relates to a stay request following a jury trial, a



                                           4                                     24-6274
permanent injunction, and a final judgment. Following a fifteen-day jury trial with

forty-five witnesses in which the jury found Google violated federal and state

antitrust laws, the district court undertook additional testimony and hearings and

issued detailed findings with respect to the Injunction.

      Google’s primary contention on appeal focuses on factual disagreements

with the district court, an effort to shoehorn the results of the Epic v. Apple

litigation into this case, and a misapprehension of essential antitrust principles. As

for security concerns, we held that the Injunction “explicitly address these risks”

through adoption of reasonable measures “to ensure that the platforms or stores,

and the apps they offer, are safe from a computer systems and security standpoint.”

Op at 64–65. In addition, the Injunction provides for a Technical Committee to

assist in resolving technical disputes, including security concerns.

      In view of the rationale and details laid out in our opinion, we conclude that

Google has not met the requirements under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure

41(d) regarding a meritorious petition for certiorari or the significant possibility of

reversal. In addition, Google’s claim for irreparable harm is unfounded in light of

trial testimony. Finally, we are unpersuaded by Google’s claim that market

confusion, monetary expenditures, and national security support a claim of

irreparable harm.

    ARGUED SEPTEMBER 17, 2021 — DECIDED JULY 11, 2023
                ____________________

   Before SYKES, Chief Judge, and FLAUM and KIRSCH, Circuit
Judges.
    SYKES, Chief Judge. This class-action lawsuit arises from a
research collaboration between Google and the University of
Chicago together with its affiliated Medical Center. (We will
refer to the latter two as “the University” unless the context
2                                                   No. 20-3134

requires otherwise.) Harnessing the power of artificial
intelligence, the research partners aspired to develop soft-
ware capable of anticipating patients’ future healthcare
needs. If successful, the software promised to reduce medi-
cal complications, eliminate unnecessary hospital stays, and,
ultimately, improve patients’ healthcare outcomes.
    As an initial step in the research effort, the University de-
livered several years of anonymized patient medical records
to Google, thus supplying it with the information needed to
“train” the software’s algorithms. A Data Use Agreement
governed the transfer. Restricting Google’s use of the rec-
ords to a list of specific research-related activities, the
agreement expressly prohibited the company from attempt-
ing to identify any patient whose records were disclosed.
    The anonymized electronic records subject to the agree-
ment included those of Matt Dinerstein, twice an inpatient at
the hospital during the period covered by the records disclo-
sure. Dinerstein sued Google and the University on behalf of
himself and a class of other patients whose anonymized
records were disclosed. He alleged several theories of liabil-
ity. He first claimed that the University had breached either
an express or an implied contract traceable to a privacy
notice he received and an authorization he signed upon each
admission to the Medical Center. Alternatively, he asserted a
claim for unjust enrichment. Citing the same notice and
authorization, he also alleged that the University had re-
neged on its promise of patient confidentiality and therefore
violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Busi-
ness Practices Act, 815 ILL. COMP. STAT. 505/1 et seq. Against
Google, he asserted claims for unjust enrichment and tor-
tious interference with his contract with the University.
No. 20-3134                                                     3

Finally, he brought a privacy claim against all defendants
based on allegations of intrusion upon seclusion.
    The district judge dismissed the consumer-fraud claim
for lack of standing and the rest of the suit for failure to state
a claim. We agree with her decision to dismiss the case, but
our analysis begins and ends with standing. Dinerstein has
not adequately alleged standing to pursue any of his claims.
To sue in federal court, a plaintiff must plausibly allege (and
later prove) that he has suffered an injury in fact that is
concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, and tracea-
ble to the defendant’s conduct. The injuries Dinerstein
alleges lack plausibility, concreteness, or imminence (or
some combination of the three). Because the complaint fails
to plausibly allege an injury in fact, we affirm but modify the
judgment to reflect a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of
standing.
                         I. Background
   Our factual account is drawn from Dinerstein’s amended
complaint. We begin with a description of his inpatient stays
at the University Medical Center—and more particularly,
the paperwork he received at the start of each admission.
Dinerstein alleges that he was first admitted to the Medical
Center on June 4, 2015, and was discharged three days later.
He was then readmitted on June 25, this time for a two-night
stay. Upon each admission Dinerstein received a Notice of
Privacy Practices detailing the University’s confidentiality
obligations and the circumstances in which it might use or
disclose patient medical information. Relevant here, the
notice stated that the University would obtain “written
permission” for the sale of such information. Patient permis-
sion was not required, however, for the University to use or
4                                                       No. 20-3134

share the information in limited research-related circum-
stances. In addition to the notice, Dinerstein received and
signed an Admission and Outpatient Agreement and Au-
thorization. By doing so he affirmed that he understood that
his medical information might be shared for approved
research purposes and that if so, he would “not be entitled to
any compensation.” He further acknowledged that “all
efforts” would “be made to protect [his] privacy” and that
“any use of [his] medical information” would comply with
both the notice and “federal and state laws.”
   During Dinerstein’s two hospital stays, the University
compiled records of his vital readings, medical procedures,
prescriptions, test results, and diagnoses. The records also
contained demographic information. After each discharge
from the hospital, the Medical Center maintained electronic
copies of his patient records.
     Approximately two years after Dinerstein’s hospital vis-
its, Google announced that it had partnered with the Univer-
sity to research new healthcare technology. With the help of
machine learning, the research partners aspired to develop
predictive modeling software that would improve the ability
of medical providers to forecast their patients’ medical needs
and, in turn, to tailor subsequent medical care. As described
in promotional statements, the project had the potential to
prevent medical complications, reduce hospital visits, and
improve overall health and well-being. 1

    To reliably predict medical outcomes, the models needed
extensive information from which to learn. The University
thus agreed to transfer to Google a large set of anonymized
patient medical records. A Data Use Agreement executed by
the partners in December 2016 governed the transfer. While
most of the agreement’s provisions are irrelevant for our
purposes, a few deserve mention. First, the agreement
contemplated that before disclosure the University would
strip the patient records of all direct identifying information
except the dates of medical events and services. Second, the
agreement delineated the records’ authorized uses. In par-
ticular, Google was permitted to use the records only to
identify key medical information, to develop predictive
models, and to assess the models’ efficacy. It could neither
disclose information from within the records nor use the
records in contravention of federal law. Most importantly,
the agreement strictly prohibited Google from using the
records “to identify any individual.” Third, if the parties’
research efforts proved successful, the agreement granted
the University a perpetual license to use the predictive
models for its own “internal non-commercial research
purposes.”
   The batch of medical records covered by the Data Use
Agreement spanned several years. Specifically, the agree-
ment directed the University to transfer to Google anony-
mized records generated from all inpatient, outpatient, and
emergency adult-patient encounters between January 1,
2010, and June 30, 2016. Both of Dinerstein’s overnight stays
occurred in June 2015, so his medical records were included
in the set disclosed to Google. Dinerstein alleges that the
University never obtained his consent—written or other-
6                                                  No. 20-3134

wise—for the third-party record disclosure. Nor did Google
seek permission to use his records.
     Dinerstein filed suit against the University and Google
seeking damages and injunctive relief on behalf of himself
and a class of patients whose anonymized records were
disclosed. He raised seven claims for relief. Against the
University he alleged claims for breach of an express or an
implied contract premised on the notice he received and the
authorization he signed upon each admission to the Medical
Center. More to the point, Dinerstein alleged that in ex-
change for his payment and personal medical information,
the University had agreed to protect and secure his infor-
mation. By sharing it with Google, the University had failed
to uphold its end of the bargain. As an alternative to his
contract claims, Dinerstein sought damages for unjust
enrichment. He also alleged a claim for violation of the
Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices
Act. This statutory claim rested on the alleged broken prom-
ises, which Dinerstein asserted the University never intend-
ed to keep in the first place.
    Turning to Google, Dinerstein alleged that the company
had tortiously interfered with his contract with the Universi-
ty. He also asserted a claim for unjust enrichment based on
the company’s receipt of valuable patient medical records.
Finally, Dinerstein brought a tort claim against Google and
the University for invasion of privacy. More specifically, he
alleged that they had intruded upon his seclusion by send-
ing and receiving his sensitive medical information.
   Relevant to this last theory of liability, Dinerstein claimed
that while he was an inpatient at the Medical Center, he had
used a smartphone with geolocation capabilities. Because he
No. 20-3134                                                   7

had also downloaded various Google apps, he alleged that
the phone granted the company access to his precise location
during every moment of his hospital stays. He further
alleged that if Google compared his location data with the
insufficiently anonymized patient records, it could easily
ascertain his identity and uncover “intimate private details”
in his medical histories. And he alleged that Google could do
the same thing with other class members’ geolocation data.
   The defendants moved to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1)
and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They argued
that Dinerstein had not alleged a concrete injury to support
Article III standing and, alternatively, that he had not stated
a cognizable claim. The judge granted the motion, agreeing
primarily with the latter argument and dismissing the
complaint in its entirety.
    On the standing issue, the judge construed Dinerstein’s
allegations about a lost benefit of the bargain as sufficient to
support standing to sue on the contract (and contract-
alternative) theories against both the University and Google.
Dinerstein v. Google, LLC, 484 F. Supp. 3d 561, 574 (N.D. Ill.
2020). She also reasoned that the allegations about an inva-
sion of privacy—in the form of a wrongful disclosure of his
private medical information—supported Dinerstein’s stand-
ing to sue for intrusion upon seclusion. Id. at 575. But the
judge dismissed the consumer-fraud claim for lack of stand-
ing because “[a] claim under [the Illinois Consumer Fraud
and Deceptive Business Practices Act] requires a showing of
actual damages,” which Dinerstein had not alleged. Id. at 579
(citing 815 ILL. COMP. STAT. 505/10a(a)).
   Moving on, the judge dismissed the claims for breach of
contract—express or implied—for failure to state a cogniza-
8                                                 No. 20-3134

ble claim because Dinerstein had not adequately pleaded
economic damages, a required element under Illinois law. Id.at 590–93; FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). Next, the judge noted but
chose not to decide the question whether Dinerstein’s claim
for tortious interference with contract necessarily fell with
the other contract claims. Instead, she held that the claim
failed for a separate reason: Dinerstein had not sufficiently
pleaded that Google had intentionally caused the University’s
breach of contract. Id. at 593. (Intent is necessary to state a
claim of tortious interference with contract in Illinois. HPI
Health Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., 
545 N.E.2d672, 676 (Ill. 1989).)
    Turning to the privacy claim, the judge observed that
Dinerstein had recharacterized his original intrusion-upon-
seclusion claim as a novel tort claim for breach of medical
confidentiality, a theory not yet recognized in Illinois. The
judge thought it unlikely that the Illinois Supreme Court
would recognize such a claim, so she declined to permit
Dinerstein to pursue it in federal court. That left only the
unjust-enrichment claims. Because unjust enrichment is not
an independent cause of action in Illinois, the judge dis-
missed those claims as well. Dinerstein appealed.
                        II. Discussion
    The dismissal order rests partly on a failure to allege
Article III standing but mostly on the judge’s conclusion that
Dinerstein failed to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted. Our review of either basis for dismissal is de novo.
Nowlin v. Pritzker, 34 F.4th 629, 632 (7th Cir. 2022). The
parties primarily focus on whether the amended complaint
satisfies the statutory and common-law pleading require-
ments particular to each claim. But the threshold question is

standing, which “is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.”
Nettles v. Midland Funding LLC, 983 F.3d 896, 899 (7th Cir.
2020).
    Standing doctrine traces its origins to Article III of the
Constitution, which grants federal courts the power to
resolve “Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2.
The doctrine’s elements are well established and familiar. To
sue in federal court, a plaintiff must have suffered (1) a
concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent injury (an
“injury in fact”) (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant
and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial
decision. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).
“[A]t the pleading stage, the plaintiff must clearly … allege
facts demonstrating each element.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,
578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (quotation marks omitted). Moreo-
ver, “standing is not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs
must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press
and for each form of relief that they seek.” TransUnion LLC v.
Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208 (2021).
    Like many of our recent cases concerning Article III
standing, this one hinges on the injury-in-fact element, and
in particular, the concreteness and imminence requirements.
While the concreteness requirement examines the substance
of a plaintiff’s asserted injury, the imminence requirement
measures its likelihood. In other words, to provide a basis to
sue in federal court, an injury must exist “in both a qualita-
tive and [a] temporal sense.” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 
495 U.S.149, 155 (1990).
   Starting with the qualitative aspect, “[a] concrete injury
must be de facto; that is, it must actually exist.” Spokeo,
578 U.S. at 340 (quotation marks omitted). Endorsing the

term’s “usual meaning,” the Supreme Court has described a
concrete injury as one that is “real[] and not abstract.” Id.(quotation marks omitted). Both tangible and intangible
harms may fit the bill, even if tangible harms like “physical
or monetary injur[ies]” are perhaps more intuitively con-
crete. TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204. As the Court has ex-
plained, our task—especially when the plaintiff asserts an
intangible harm—is to assess whether the alleged injury has
“a close relationship to a harm traditionally recognized as
providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts.” Id.(quotation marks omitted). The inquiry asks whether the
plaintiff has “identified a close historical or common-law
analogue” for his asserted injury. Id. Put another way, when
reviewing a plaintiff’s alleged injury for concreteness,
“[h]istory and tradition remain our ever-present guides.”
Pierre v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc., 29 F.4th 934, 938 (7th Cir.
2022).
    Imminence is more of an “elastic concept.” Lujan,
504 U.S. at 564 n.2. While it lacks a precise framework, the
basic function of the imminence requirement “is to ensure
that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III
purposes.” Id. Accordingly, a plaintiff who has not suffered
a past harm cannot simply rest on allegations that he may
suffer some “possible future injury,” Whitmore, 
495 U.S. at158, “at some indefinite future time,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564n.2. His threatened injury instead must be “certainly impend-
ing” to satisfy Article III. Id. And importantly, while an
imminent risk of future harm may suffice to support stand-
ing to sue for prospective relief (i.e., an injunction), a claim for
damages requires a concrete harm that has in fact occurred.
TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11.

    With these fundamental standing principles in mind, we
turn to the claims presented in this case. At the outset,
however, we note that Dinerstein omitted from his opening
brief any discussion about the claims for unjust enrichment
or breach of an implied contract. By doing so, he abandoned
these claims on appeal, and we need not consider them. See
White v. United States, 8 F.4th 547, 552 (7th Cir. 2021); see also
FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring that the appellant’s
brief include his “contentions and the reasons for them”).
What remains is the privacy claim, the claim for breach of an
express contract, the consumer-fraud claim, and the claim
for tortious interference with contract. We address each in
turn.
A. Privacy Claim
    We begin with the alleged breach of privacy because the
asserted injury underlying this claim is common to all claims
that remain live on appeal. In other words, our resolution of
the standing issue on this claim necessarily resolves portions
of others, streamlining our discussion of the claims that
follow.
    Before diving into the standing analysis, we must discern
what, exactly, Dinerstein’s privacy claim is. His complaint
characterizes the defendants’ conduct as a common-law
intrusion upon seclusion, which is potentially actionable
when the alleged tortfeasor “intentionally intrudes, physical-
ly or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another.”
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 652(B) (AM. LAW INST.
1977) [hereinafter RESTATEMENT]. The Illinois Supreme Court
has adopted this definition of the tort, describing the pur-
pose of the seclusion right as “protecting a person from
another’s prying into their physical boundaries or affairs.”
12                                                  No. 20-3134

W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Krishna Schaumburg Tan, Inc.,

Nat’l Bank, 534 N.E.2d 987, 988–89 (Ill. 1989).
    Apparently accepting that neither defendant’s conduct
fits the elements of this tort, Dinerstein abandoned his
intrusion-upon-seclusion theory below, as the district judge
noted. Dinerstein, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 594. In his response to
the defendants’ motion to dismiss, Dinerstein reframed his
privacy claim as a breach of medical confidentiality, a novel
cause of action that posits a common-law duty of medical
providers to maintain patient confidentiality. Several states
have recognized some variety of this tort. See, e.g., Lawson v.
Halpern-Reiss, 212 A.3d 1213, 1219 (Vt. 2019); Byrne v. Avery
Ctr. for Obstetrics & Gynecology, P.C., 175 A.3d 1, 17 (Conn.
2018); McCormick v. England, 494 S.E.2d 431, 437 (S.C. Ct.
App. 1997). But Illinois is not one of them. Dinerstein there-
fore invited the district judge, sitting in diversity, to hold
that the Illinois Supreme Court would recognize the tort
under Illinois law. See Zahn v. N. Am. Power & Gas, LLC,
815 F.3d 1082, 1087 (7th Cir. 2016) ([W]e must use our own
best judgment to estimate how the [Illinois] Supreme Court
would rule as to its law.” (quotation marks omitted)). As
we’ve noted, the judge declined that invitation. Dinerstein,
484 F. Supp. 3d at 595.
   More importantly for our purposes, however, Dinerstein
has chosen to stick with the new version of his privacy claim
on appeal. He premises his privacy-related challenges
exclusively on the novel medical-confidentiality theory.
Following his lead, then, we focus our discussion of standing
on the reframed privacy theory.
No. 20-3134                                                   13

    Dinerstein presents his privacy injury in two forms, one
backward-looking and the other forward-looking. But
considered in either direction—past or future—his asserted
injury does not establish standing to sue.
   1. Past Harm
    We start with the backward-looking form of injury. Cru-
cially, Dinerstein does not allege that Google has already
used the disclosed patient records to discern his identity.
Instead he focuses on the conduct of the University, arguing
that the record transfer was itself an actionable invasion of
his medical privacy. This is so, Dinerstein asserts, regardless
of whether Google ever actually identifies him.
    By referencing a common-law privacy invasion,
Dinerstein attempts to compare his asserted injury to a harm
“traditionally recognized as providing a basis for lawsuits in
American courts.” TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204. In other
words, he engages with the proper inquiry under the
Supreme Court’s recent standing caselaw. But as we’ve
explained, an “invasion of privacy” is not a standalone tort;
the term “encompasse[s] four theories of wrongdoing: intru-
sion upon seclusion, appropriation of a person’s name or
likeness, publicity given to private life, and publicity placing
a person in a false light.” Pucillo v. Nat’l Credit Sys., Inc.,
66 F.4th 634, 639–40 (7th Cir. 2023) (quoting Persinger v. Sw.
Credit Sys., L.P., 20 F.4th 1184, 1192 (7th Cir. 2021)); see also
RESTATEMENT §§ 652A–652E. And because TransUnion
requires us to nail down a particular common-law analogue,
we must assess whether any of the recognized privacy torts
is sufficiently analogous to Dinerstein’s asserted injury. If
not, no concrete harm. “No concrete harm, no standing.”
TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2214.
14                                                         No. 20-3134

    Of the four traditional privacy tort theories, the closest
comparator to Dinerstein’s new theory is probably the tort of
publicity given to private life, which occurs when someone
“gives publicity” to a “highly offensive” matter “concerning
the private life of another” that “is not of legitimate concern
to the public.” RESTATEMENT § 652D. Yet Dinerstein has
identified no case in which a court has permitted a plaintiff
to bring a public-disclosure tort premised on the dissemina-
tion of anonymized information. 2 Indeed, while the relevant
caselaw is sparse, we’re skeptical that this alleged factual
scenario would give rise to any injury at all—let alone one
concrete enough to support Article III standing. See, e.g.,
Shulman v. Grp. W Prods., Inc., 955 P.2d 469, 489 n.12 (Cal.
1998) (“[C]omplete lack of identification or identifiability
would seemingly defeat a private facts claim, as there could
be no injury … .”); Harris ex rel. Harris v. Easton Publ’g Co.,
483 A.2d 1377, 1385 (Pa. 1984) (“Absent an ability to identify
the complainant, there can be no communication and hence,
no publicity.”); cf. Frobose v. Am. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 
152 F.3d602, 618 (7th Cir. 1998) (rejecting a false-light claim because
the communication neither mentioned the plaintiff by name
nor made her “readily identifiable to the public”).
    Resisting this conclusion, Dinerstein contends that the
University’s records were insufficiently anonymized. He
cites a presentation from the 2017 Google Cloud Next con-
ference by Dr. Samuel Volchenboum, the University’s
Associate Chief Research Informatics Officer. Dinerstein
argues that Dr. Volchenboum’s presentation highlighted

2 Nor has Dinerstein identified a case in which a court has permitted a
plaintiff to bring the novel claim of breach of medical confidentiality in
circumstances like these.
No. 20-3134                                                           15

various deficiencies in the “typical de-identification pro-
cess.” 3 He contends that the process risks leaving identifying
clues like the patient’s age, place of residence, and family
relations scattered throughout the purportedly “de-
identified” medical records. According to Dinerstein, such
clues are routinely found in the treating physician’s “free-
text” clinical notes. If these clues are pieced together,
reidentification is supposedly simple.
    But Dinerstein’s complaint omits any allegations linking
the so-called “typical de-identification process” described in
Dr. Volchenboum’s presentation to the University’s de-
identification process here. Put differently, just because some
de-identification processes might be deficient, we cannot
assume that the University’s process was necessarily so. To
the contrary, the complaint acknowledges that the chal-
lenged record transfer occurred pursuant to the Data Use
Agreement, which states that “the majority of [patient]
identifiers will be removed,” leaving only “actual dates of
[medical] service and events.” Dinerstein’s allegations of
insufficient anonymization therefore do not cross the plausi-
bility threshold. See Silha v. ACT, Inc., 807 F.3d 169, 174 (7th
Cir. 2015) (“[T]he Twombly-Iqbal facial plausibility require-
ment for pleading a claim is incorporated into the standard
for pleading subject matter jurisdiction.”).
    Moreover, Dinerstein appears to concede that the Uni-
versity adequately discharged its de-identification obliga-
tion. Describing a jointly authored article from the
University and Google, the complaint states that although

“the [date stamps] from the University patients’ records
were maintained,” the records otherwise had been “de-
identified.” And aside from the date stamps, Dinerstein does
not pinpoint any information within the records that he
thinks should have been redacted and was not. Nor does he
allege that the date stamps alone were impermissibly identi-
fying. At most he alleges that some personally identifying
information “may have evaded redaction”—a hypothetical
that does not support his repeated but conclusory assertions
that the University’s records were insufficiently anony-
mized. “Such … bare assertion[s] of harm—unsupported by
any concrete details”—do not suffice to allege a plausible,
concrete injury. Nowlin, 34 F.4th at 633.
     2. Risk of Future Harm
    That brings us to Dinerstein’s allegations of a forward-
looking privacy injury. Unlike the backward-looking injury,
this injury turns on Google’s conduct—or more precisely, its
anticipated conduct. At bottom, Dinerstein worries that the
date stamps contained in the transferred medical records,
along with the geolocation and demographic data collected
from his smartphone apps, offer Google a “perfect formula-
tion of data points” for later reidentification. In other words,
the record transfer created a risk that he might someday be
reidentified.
   To the extent that Dinerstein rests his claim for damages
on allegations of future risk, the argument is a nonstarter. In
TransUnion the Supreme Court clarified that unless a “risk of
future harm materializes,” a plaintiff may rely on an “immi-
nent and substantial” risk of harm only when “pursu[ing]
forward-looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from
occurring.” 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11 (emphasis added). Or as our
No. 20-3134                                                   17

court has summarized: “A plaintiff seeking money damages
has standing to sue in federal court only for harms that have
in fact materialized.” Pierre, 29 F.4th at 938. Because
Dinerstein alleges no material harm arising from the alleged
risk of future reidentification, that future risk cannot support
standing to sue for damages.
    The alleged risk does not support standing to sue for in-
junctive relief either, though for a different reason: the risk
Dinerstein alleges is not sufficiently imminent. To be sure,
Google possesses a wealth of data about most, if not all,
Americans. Yet Dinerstein ignores that the governing Data
Use Agreement expressly prohibited Google from using the
transferred medical records—either by themselves or in
tandem with data already in its possession—“to identify any
individual.” And even if the contractual obligation doesn’t
itself foreclose the risk of reidentification, Dinerstein has not
alleged that Google has taken any steps to identify him. Nor,
for that matter, does he allege that Google intends to do so.
Without any allegations to that effect, “we cannot simply
presume a material risk of concrete harm.” TransUnion,
141 S. Ct. at 2212 (quoting Ramirez v. TransUnion LLC,
951 F.3d 1008, 1040 (9th Cir. 2020) (opinion of McKeown, J.)).
The risk of future injury is thus nowhere near “certainly
impending”; it is too speculative to satisfy the imminence
requirement for a suit for injunctive relief in federal court.
   Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 568 U.S. 398 (2013),
supports this holding. In Clapper attorneys and human-rights
organizations raised constitutional challenges to § 1881a of
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, arguing that
individuals with whom they regularly communicated were
probable targets of foreign electronic surveillance under the
18                                                   No. 20-3134

Act. Id. at 406. Because of the possibility of surveillance, the
plaintiffs claimed that their international communications
were likely to be incidentally “acquired under § 1881a at
some point in the future.” Id. at 407.
    The Court rejected this alleged future injury as a basis for
standing, reasoning that it rested on multiple layers of
“highly speculative fear.” Id. at 410. In particular, the “chain
of contingencies”—specifically that (1) the government
would choose to target their foreign contacts pursuant to its
§ 1881a authority; (2) the government would succeed in both
securing the requisite authorization and intercepting the
targeted communications; and (3) the plaintiffs would be
parties to those communications—“d[id] not satisfy the
requirement that threatened injury must be certainly im-
pending.” Id. The plaintiffs had offered little more than
speculation and assumptions—and importantly, “no specific
facts”—that their communications would actually be ac-
quired. Id. at 412. So too here. Dinerstein has expressed only
a “highly speculative fear” that Google might, “at some
point in the future,” identify him. Id. at 407, 410.
    Our decisions in Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Group, LLC,
794 F.3d 688 (7th Cir. 2015), and Lewert v. P.F. Chang’s China
Bistro, Inc., 819 F.3d 963 (7th Cir. 2016), are not to the contra-
ry. As an initial matter, both predate TransUnion. While that
is not to say that they are no longer authoritative, it is to
recognize that TransUnion marked a shift in the Court’s
standing jurisprudence. But even on their own terms,
Remijas and Lewert do not help Dinerstein’s standing argu-
ment here. In both cases we held that the plaintiffs had
sufficiently alleged a substantial risk of future harm stem-
ming from breaches of their credit-card information. Remijas,
No. 20-3134                                                               19

794 F.3d at 693–94; Lewert, 819 F.3d at 967. Motivating our
decisions was the common-sense observation that hackers
steal private credit-card information for a primary purpose:
“to make fraudulent charges or assume … consumers’
identities.” Remijas, 794 F.3d at 693; Lewert, 819 F.3d at 967.
Therefore, the plaintiffs’ allegations about a substantial risk
of future harm had “cross[ed] the line from conceivable to
plausible.” Lewert, 819 F.3d at 968 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).
    The same cannot be said here. Absent from this case is a
comparable indication—rooted in common sense or other-
wise—that Google’s primary purpose in obtaining the
medical records was to reidentify the University’s patients.
Indeed, the fact that Google explicitly agreed not “to identify
any individual” is enough to rule out the contention that the
threat of reidentification is certainly impending. Quite the
opposite; that contention is wholly speculative and implau-
sible. It cannot supply the basis for standing. 4
B. Contract Claim
   Next we assess the alleged injuries underlying
Dinerstein’s claim for breach of an express contract, a claim


4  Even if Dinerstein’s asserted privacy injury—past or future—were
sufficient to support standing (it is not), we see no reason to disturb the
judge’s decision not to recognize a novel claim for breach of medical
confidentiality. Illinois courts have not yet weighed in on the issue, and
“it is not our role to break new ground in state law.” Roppo v. Travelers
Com. Ins. Co., 869 F.3d 568, 596 (7th Cir. 2017) (quoting Lopardo v. Fleming
Cos., 97 F.3d 921, 930 (7th Cir. 1996)). This is especially true with
“[i]nnovative state law claims,” which “should be brought in state
court.” Insolia v. Philip Morris Inc., 216 F.3d 596, 607 (7th Cir. 2000). But
because Dinerstein lacks standing, we have no need to address this issue.
20                                                     No. 20-3134

he brings only against the University. Recall that Dinerstein
roots the University’s purported contractual duty in the
Notice of Privacy Practices he received and the Admission
and Outpatient Agreement and Authorization he signed
each time he was admitted to the Medical Center. He argues
that these documents contractually obligated the University
to safeguard his medical information. In his view, transfer-
ring his medical records to Google was a flagrant breach of
that obligation.
    To support standing to bring this claim, Dinerstein as-
serts three injuries. The first stems from his interest in priva-
cy—i.e., the injury we’ve already addressed and deemed
insufficient to support standing. The second, presented in
two forms, is pecuniary: Dinerstein contends that he overpaid
the University for his medical treatment or, alternatively,
that the University underpaid him for the interest in his
medical records. The third is contractual: Dinerstein con-
tends that the University’s breach of contract is itself an
actionable concrete injury.
     1. Pecuniary Harms
    We turn first to Dinerstein’s alleged pecuniary injuries,
which the Supreme Court has described as “traditional
tangible harms” that “readily qualify as concrete injuries
under Article III.” TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204. Even if
concrete, however, Dinerstein’s allegations of injury must be
plausible “to survive dismissal for lack of standing.” Diedrich
v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, 839 F.3d 583, 588 (7th Cir. 2016)
(citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)); see also Silha,
807 F.3d at 174. While Dinerstein alleges both an overpay-
ment and underpayment theory of financial harm, neither is
plausible and neither supplies a basis for standing.
No. 20-3134                                                  21

    Dinerstein’s overpayment theory rests on allegations that
the medical care he (more precisely, his insurer) purchased
came bundled with a promise of medical confidentiality.
Because the University failed to deliver on that promise, he
contends that he was deprived of the full benefit of his
bargain. Not only that, he also would not have purchased
the University’s medical treatment had he known that it
intended to share his private health information.
    This is not the first time we’ve confronted an argument
like this one. In Remijas, 794 F.3d at 694–95, and Lewert,
819 F.3d at 968, the plaintiffs argued that they had overpaid
Neiman Marcus and P.F. Chang’s, respectively, because the
companies had failed to protect their credit-card infor-
mation. While we did not outright reject the plaintiffs’
theories, we expressed serious skepticism. We described the
plaintiffs’ injuries in Remijas, for example, as “problematic.”
794 F.3d at 694. And in both cases we explained that courts
have not entertained the overpayment theory of injury
outside the product-liability context, and we saw no need to
extend it “beyond its current scope.” Lewert, 819 F.3d at 968;
Remijas, 794 F.3d at 695.
    Dinerstein has not alleged a defect in his medical care,
and we again are not inclined to recognize the overpayment
theory outside the product-liability context. (In this case that
would require extending it “from a particular product to the
operation of [an] entire” medical facility. Remijas, 
794 F.3d at695.) Perhaps anticipating this doctrinal problem, Dinerstein
tries to distinguish Remijas and Lewert, arguing that the
overpayment theories in those cases were implausible
because the companies had not charged an extra fee for
credit-card transactions. In other words, the plaintiffs had
22                                                  No. 20-3134

not paid for credit-card data security. But this case is no
different. It is wholly implausible—and Dinerstein alleges
nothing to the contrary—that the University charged a
discrete “patient-confidentiality fee.” Indeed, the fact that it
reserved the right to share patient medical information for
approved research purposes suggests exactly the opposite.
So too does the fact that Dinerstein signed a release stating
that he would “not be entitled to any compensation, regard-
less of the value of such research or any products or inven-
tions developed therefrom.”
    Dinerstein’s most helpful case is from another circuit. In
Carlsen v. GameStop, Inc., 833 F.3d 903, 909 (8th Cir. 2016), the
Eighth Circuit held that the plaintiff had alleged an “actual”
financial injury “in an amount equal to the difference be-
tween the value of [what] he paid for and the value of [what]
he received, i.e., a [digital magazine] subscription with
compromised privacy protection.” As our decisions in
Remijas and Lewert make clear, we’re not inclined to extend
the overpayment theory of injury to novel contexts. Regard-
less, Carlsen is also distinguishable for the reason we just
mentioned: Dinerstein’s overpayment injury is particularly
implausible given his express agreement that his medical
information “may be used and shared for research.” And his
argument that he would not have paid for the University’s
medical services had he known otherwise is similarly im-
plausible.
    We are even more skeptical of Dinerstein’s second pecu-
niary theory—that the unauthorized use of his medical
information conferred a financial benefit on the University to
which he is entitled. This financial benefit apparently came
in the form of the perpetual software license reserved for the
No. 20-3134                                                 23

University in the Data Use Agreement. To remedy the
University’s unjust benefit, Dinerstein suggests that the
court could order disgorgement or “at least a reasonable
royalty.”
    Putting aside the fact that Dinerstein agreed that he was
not entitled to compensation for the use of his medical
information, his asserted injury cannot supply a basis for
standing. As an initial matter, Illinois law does not grant a
patient a property interest in his medical records; they
instead belong to the medical provider. Young v. Murphy,
90 F.3d 1225, 1236 (7th Cir. 1996) (“While Illinois law permits
a patient to inspect and copy his records … , there is no basis
for concluding that this grants a property interest in those
records to the patient.”); Holtkamp Trucking Co. v. Fletcher,
932 N.E.2d 34, 43–44 (Ill. App. Ct. 2010).
    Additionally, this standing theory is squarely foreclosed
by our caselaw. In Silha we held “that a plaintiff’s claim of
injury in fact cannot be based solely on a defendant’s gain; it
must be based on a plaintiff’s loss.” 807 F.3d at 174–75.
There, students who had taken standardized college admis-
sions tests alleged that the testing agencies had shared their
personal information with educational institutions. The
students had consented to information sharing, yet the
agencies had not disclosed that they had profited from what
was really a sale of the students’ information. Id. at 171.
While the complaint highlighted the agencies’ profits, miss-
ing was any allegation that the students had “lost anything
of value as a result of the alleged misconduct.” Id. at 175.
Because their claimed injury was “based solely on a gain” to
the agencies, we held that the students had not established
an injury in fact. Id.24                                                No. 20-3134

    So too here. Dinerstein has not alleged that the Universi-
ty’s use of his medical information somehow deprived him
of its economic value. And although Dinerstein attempts to
distinguish Silha by arguing that unlike him, the students
had consented to disclosure, nothing about our resolution of
the case turned on consent. Silha’s controlling principle—
that a plaintiff cannot base an injury in fact solely on the
defendant’s gain—likewise controls here. In sum, neither of
Dinerstein’s alleged pecuniary injuries establishes standing
to sue under Article III.
     2. Breach of Contract
    What’s left, then, is Dinerstein’s argument that a breach
of contract is itself a legally cognizable injury in fact. He
contends that common-law courts traditionally entertained
claims for breach of contract regardless of whether the
plaintiff alleged any harm beyond the breach itself. From
this he infers that an allegation of a breach of contract is
enough, without more, to support Article III standing. In his
view, our caselaw supports his interpretation, and the
Supreme Court’s recent standing cases, namely Spokeo and
TransUnion, do not disturb it.
    Even if Dinerstein’s historical account is correct, we read
the Court’s recent standing cases differently. In TransUnion
the Court confirmed that “an injury in law is not an injury in
fact.” 141 S. Ct. at 2205. That statement itself might be
enough to resolve Dinerstein’s “breach-alone” standing
theory. Yet to explain why our view diverges from
Dinerstein’s and that of one of our sister circuits, some
additional unpacking is warranted.
No. 20-3134                                                     25

    As we’ve already discussed, establishing an injury in fact
requires a plaintiff to show that he has suffered a concrete
injury—one that is both “real” and “de facto” and that “actu-
ally exist[s].” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340. Refining the concrete-
ness requirement, the Court in TransUnion emphasized the
distinction between (1) the cause of action giving a plaintiff
the right to sue over a defendant’s legal infraction and
(2) the injury, if any, that he suffered as a result. 
141 S. Ct. at2205. To sue in federal court, a plaintiff must have both; a
suitable cause of action cannot save a plaintiff’s case if he has
suffered no harm. In other words, only a plaintiff who has
been “concretely harmed” by the defendant’s legal infraction
“may sue that private defendant over [it] in federal court.”
Id.    Applying these concepts here, Dinerstein cannot rest on
the University’s alleged breach of contract as a discrete de
facto injury supporting his standing to sue in federal court. It
is at most an injury in law, which we know from TransUnion
“is not an injury in fact.” Id. (emphasis added). As one
scholar put it:
       The logic of Spokeo—that standing cannot rest
       on violations of legal rights that do not result
       in factual harms—extends to suits alleging
       breach of contract. After all, contracts simply
       establish legal rights. By Spokeo’s reasoning, a
       plaintiff should not have standing to sue for
       breach of contract if the breach does not result
       in some additional factual harm.
F. Andrew Hessick, Standing and Contracts, 89 GEO. WASH. L.
REV. 298, 313 (2021). Slightly rephrased, Dinerstein cannot
simply allege a bare breach of contract, “divorced from any
26                                                No. 20-3134

concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of
Article III.” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341. Without an allegation
that the purported breach resulted in some concrete harm,
we lack the “freewheeling power” to hold the University
accountable for its alleged “legal infraction[].”Casillas v.
Madison Ave. Assocs., Inc., 926 F.3d 329, 332 (7th Cir. 2019).
    Yet Dinerstein retorts that Spokeo and TransUnion are ir-
relevant to the standing question here because neither
addressed common-law claims like breach of contract. He
reads the cases to answer only whether (and if so, when)
Congress may “elevate to the status of legally cognizable” an
injury that was “previously inadequate in law.” TransUnion,
141 S. Ct. at 2204–05 (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341). To be
sure, Spokeo and TransUnion did address and decide those
questions. But we read the standing principles expounded in
those cases to extend beyond the statutory context. The
Court’s opinion in TransUnion, for example, set out to an-
swer the broader question: “What makes a harm concrete for
purposes of Article III?” Id. at 2204. In answering that ques-
tion, the Court issued important and broadly applicable
statements, including those just mentioned, about the
boundaries of the federal judicial power. Fairly interpreted,
those statements apply to all asserted injuries, not just
statutory violations.
    To give a few more examples of TransUnion’s capacious
language, the Court observed that where a “plaintiff has not
suffered any physical, monetary, or cognizable intangible
harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a
lawsuit in American courts,” his “lawsuit may not proceed.”
Id. at 2206. And it defended “the concrete-harm require-
ment” as “essential to the Constitution’s separation of
No. 20-3134                                                   27

powers.” Id. at 2207. Article III does not empower federal
courts “to publicly opine on every legal question” or to
“exercise general legal oversight … of private entities.” Id. at
2203. Yet by asking us to weigh in on the University’s al-
leged breach of contract in the absence of any actual harm,
Dinerstein invites us to function “not as an Article III court,
but as a moot court,” and do exactly that. Uzuegbunam v.
Preczewski, 141 S. Ct. 792, 804 (2021) (Roberts, C.J., dissent-
ing). We decline the invitation. Taking up such matters “is,
by very definition, for a court to act ultra vires.” Steel Co. v.
Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102 (1998).
    These general standing principles guided the Court as it
then considered when Congress may give a real-world
injury “actionable legal status.” TransUnion, 
141 S. Ct. at2205. And contrary to Dinerstein’s view, the Court’s framing
of this more specific question also supports our reading of its
recent caselaw. Rather than ask whether federal courts may
depart from established standing doctrine when Congress
has attempted to define an injury, in Spokeo and TransUnion
the Court explored when a congressionally defined injury
might satisfy the existing doctrine. The cases speak, for
example, about Congress’s lack of authority to “erase
Article III’s standing requirements,” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339(quotation marks omitted), and about our obligation to
“independently decide whether a plaintiff has suffered a
concrete harm under Article III” notwithstanding Congress’s
creation of new statutory duties, TransUnion, 
141 S. Ct. at2205. Simply put, Spokeo and TransUnion established “fun-
damental standing principles,” id. at 2207, and those princi-
ples control this case.
28                                                           No. 20-3134

    If Spokeo and TransUnion leave any doubt about whether
a breach of contract is itself a concrete injury, Thole v. U.S.
Bank N.A., 140 S. Ct. 1615 (2020), resolves it. Thole involved
claims for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. Two
participants in a defined-benefit retirement plan sued the
bank contending that it had mismanaged the plan. But
crucially, they had sustained no monetary injury from the
mismanagement. Id. at 1618. The Supreme Court thus af-
firmed the Eighth Circuit’s dismissal for lack of standing and
in so doing rejected the participants’ attempted trust-law
analogy. “[A] defined-benefit plan,” the Court reasoned, “is
more in the nature of a contract. The plan participants’
benefits are fixed and will not change, regardless of how
well or poorly the plan is managed.” Id. at 1620 (emphasis
added). Because the Court held that the plan participants
nonetheless lacked standing to pursue their claims, we
understand Thole to imply that an alleged breach of contract,
without any corresponding actual harm, does not give rise to
an Article III case or controversy. 5
   Nor are we persuaded by Dinerstein’s argument that the
Court’s instructions in Spokeo and TransUnion—that we must
compare the plaintiff’s asserted injury to harms traditionally
recognized at common law—resolves the standing question
here. As we understand the argument, he contends that


5 In fact, the dissent raised this precise point. Thole v. U.S. Bank N.A.,
140 S. Ct. 1615, 1630 (2020) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (reasoning that the
plan participants had standing because a “breach of contract always
creates a right of action, even when no financial harm was caused”
(quotation marks omitted)). That the majority was not persuaded by this
view further supports our conclusion that a breach of contract does not
by itself confer standing to sue.
No. 20-3134                                                           29

because common-law courts allowed a plaintiff to vindicate
his contractual rights without a further showing of injury, he
need not allege anything aside from the University’s bare
breach of contract.
    True, common-law courts historically heard contract cas-
es and awarded nominal damages even when the breach
either “caused no loss” or “the amount of the loss [wa]s not
proved.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 346(2) (AM.
LAW INST. 1981); see also Springer v. Cleveland Clinic Emp.
Health Plan Total Care, 900 F.3d 284, 292–93 (6th Cir. 2018)
(Thapar, J., concurring) (“[Common-law courts] entertained
breach-of-contract claims even when no real loss [could] be
prove[n]. Such violations at least deserved nominal damag-
es … .” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Yet “[t]he
requirements of Art[icle] III are not satisfied merely because
a party … has couched [his] request for forms of relief
historically associated with courts of law in terms that have a
familiar ring to those trained in the legal process.” Valley
Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church &
State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).
    More importantly, however, Spokeo and TransUnion put
an end to federal courts hearing claims premised on nonex-
istent injuries—regardless of historical pedigree.6 And the
Court’s recently announced “historical-analogue test” does
not suggest otherwise. That test asks whether a modern
injury bears a “close relationship” to a harm traditionally

6 See William Baude, Standing in the Shadow of Congress, 2016 S. CT. REV.
197, 217 (“[I]t is hard to see how nominal damages are fully consistent
with the logic of Spokeo. The very premise of nominal damages is that
one cannot show any ‘actual injury’ apart from the violation of the legal
right itself.” (citing Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978))).
30                                                 No. 20-3134

recognized by common-law courts. TransUnion, 
141 S. Ct. at2204. It does not, however, transform into a concrete factual
injury what the common law has historically regarded as a
legal injury. Put differently, a historical record is no talis-
man. It is necessary, but not sufficient, to satisfy the
Article III concreteness requirement.
    Still, because Dinerstein views Spokeo, TransUnion, and
Thole as inapposite, he argues that our prior decision in J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. McDonald, 760 F.3d 646 (7th Cir.
2014), binds us. Relevant here, at issue in J.P. Morgan was
whether a bank had standing to block an ongoing arbitration
proceeding that two investors had initiated after losing
approximately a quarter of their initial investment. The
contracts governing the investors’ accounts included a
forum-selection clause that required disputes to be brought
in either state or federal court. Id. at 649. Seeking to enforce
the forum-selection provision, the bank sued the investors in
federal court. After months of litigation, the judge dismissed
the bank’s claims for lack of standing. Id. at 650.
    Reversing the dismissal, we held that the bank had
standing to enforce the clause. To form a bilateral contract,
each party must “take on one or more legally binding obliga-
tions,” we explained. Id. “When one party fails to honor its
commitments, the other party to the contract suffers a legal
injury sufficient to create standing even where that party
seems not to have incurred monetary loss or other concrete
harm.” Id. at 650–51. Because the bank had alleged that the
investors had “violated the terms of th[eir] bargain” by
selecting an improper dispute-resolution forum, it had
established standing to sue. Id. at 651.
No. 20-3134                                                    31

    Dinerstein understandably seizes on this favorable lan-
guage, but he omits the discussion that follows it. We went
on to explain in J.P. Morgan that the bank had “a very real
financial interest in the arbitration” because it was statutori-
ly and contractually obligated to “foot the bill” for the
resulting costs. Id. Given this independent financial interest,
the standing question was not merely “one of abstract
principle”; it was yet another reason why the bank had
standing to sue. Id.    The concrete harms present in J.P. Morgan—being hauled
into an improper forum and financing the resulting costs—
distinguish it from this case. Moreover, while those harms
prevent us from needing to revisit J.P. Morgan, we note that
some language in the opinion is in tension with the Supreme
Court’s recent decisions in Spokeo and TransUnion. No longer
is “a legal injury sufficient to create standing.” J.P. Morgan,
760 F.3d at 651. “[U]nder Article III, an injury in law is not
an injury in fact. Only those plaintiffs who have been con-
cretely harmed” by a defendant may sue in federal court.
TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2205. Any portion of our opinion in
J.P. Morgan that suggests otherwise cannot control here.
    Finally, we recognize that some tension also exists be-
tween our analysis here and that of a few of our sister cir-
cuits. There is no direct conflict, however. For starters, many
of the out-of-circuit decisions pointing in the other direction
predate TransUnion, a watershed decision on the standing
doctrine. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 
953 F.3d529, 536 (8th Cir. 2020); Springer, 900 F.3d at 287; Katz v.
Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2012). Of the circuits to
consider the issue post-TransUnion, we understand one to
agree with our position, Perry v. Newsom, 18 F.4th 622, 632
32                                                  No. 20-3134

(9th Cir. 2021) (“An analogy to a traditionally recognized
cause of action does not relieve a complainant of its burden
to demonstrate an injury.”); one to leave it unresolved,
Glennborough Homeowners Ass’n v. U.S. Postal Serv., 
21 F.4th410, 415–16 (6th Cir. 2021) (“We need not resolve these
thorny questions today … .”); and one to come out the other
way, Denning v. Bond Pharmacy, Inc., 50 F.4th 445, 451 (5th
Cir. 2022) (“[A] breach of contract is a sufficient injury for
standing purposes.”). But the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in
Denning did not engage with the logic of Spokeo and
TransUnion and rested in part on its own precedent. We
therefore do not understand the Fifth Circuit’s decision to
conflict with our own, nor are we inclined to adopt its
approach. As we read Thole, TransUnion, and Spokeo, a
breach of contract alone—without any actual harm—is
purely an injury in law, not an injury in fact. And it therefore
falls short of the Article III requirements for a suit in federal
court.
C. Remaining Claims
    We need not spend much time addressing the tortious-
interference and consumer-fraud claims. Both rest on the
same allegations of a privacy, pecuniary, or contractual
injury that we’ve already examined and deemed insufficient
to confer standing.
    Put simply, Dinerstein seeks to invoke the power of the
federal courts to challenge the lawfulness of an event that
caused him no harm. But federal courts do not offer “judicial
determination[s] that the plaintiffs’ interpretation of the law
is correct”; we resolve cases and controversies. Uzuegbunam,
141 S. Ct. at 804 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Because
Dinerstein has not alleged a plausible, concrete, and actual
No. 20-3134                                            33

or imminent injury to support his standing to sue, no such
case or controversy exists here. We accordingly modify the
judgment to reflect a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of
standing. As modified, the judgment is

                            CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION

                IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

                              SIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT

 ERIC MAYRON,                                      H044592
                                                  (Santa Clara County
          Plaintiff and Appellant,                 Super. Ct. No. CV275940)

          v.

 GOOGLE LLC,

          Defendant and Respondent.


        In this putative class action, plaintiff Eric Mayron sued Google LLC for violating
the automatic renewal law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17600, et seq.) and for unfair
competition (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et seq.). Plaintiff appeals after the trial court
sustained Google’s demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. We conclude
there is no private right of action for violation of the automatic renewal law. Further,
since plaintiff has not alleged an injury caused by Google’s conduct, he has no standing
to sue under the unfair competition statute. We will therefore affirm the judgment.
                                      I. BACKGROUND
        California’s automatic renewal law was enacted “to end the practice of ongoing
charging of consumer credit or debit cards [] without the consumers’ explicit consent for
ongoing shipments of a product or ongoing deliveries of service.” (Bus. & Prof. Code,
§ 17600 (unspecified statutory references are to this code).) The law requires a
consumer’s affirmative consent to any subscription agreement automatically renewed for
a new term when the initial term ends. (§ 17602, subd. (a)(2).) It further requires “clear
and conspicuous” disclosure of the offer terms, and an “easy-to-use mechanism for
cancellation.” (§ 17602, subds. (a)(1), (b).)
       Plaintiff sued Google on behalf of a putative class, alleging that Google’s
subscription data storage plan violates the automatic renewal law. As described in the
complaint, “Google Drive” allows users (those registered for a Google account) to
remotely store electronic data that can be accessed from any computer, smartphone, or
similar device. There is no charge for 15 gigabytes of storage capacity. For a $1.99
monthly fee, users can upgrade to 100 gigabytes of storage. Plaintiff alleged the
upgraded Google Drive plan violates the automatic renewal law because Google did not
provide the required clear and conspicuous disclosures nor obtain his affirmative consent
to commence a recurring monthly subscription agreement, and did not adequately explain
how to cancel.
       Plaintiff asserted one cause of action for violation of the automatic renewal law,
and another for statutory unfair competition based on the alleged unlawful practice.
Google demurred to the complaint. It argued there is no private right of action under the
automatic renewal law and that plaintiff did not allege actual injury sufficient to confer
standing for an unfair competition claim. The trial court ultimately sustained the
demurrer without leave to amend.
                                   II.    DISCUSSION
       Appellate review of a decision sustaining a demurrer is de novo. (Moore v.
Regents of University of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125.) We assume the truth of
the allegations in the complaint and determine whether a valid cause of action is stated
under any legal theory. (Doan v. State Farm General Ins. Co. (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 1082, 1091.)


   A. THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF
      ACTION
       A private party can sue for violation of a statute only where the statute in question
allows it. (Lu v. Hawaiian Gardens Casino, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 592, 596 (Lu).) We


                                             2
first examine the statutory text to see if it contains “ ‘clear, understandable, unmistakable
terms,’ which strongly and directly” indicate a private right of action is allowed. (Id. at
p. 597.) The statute may, for instance, refer to obtaining a remedy or enforcing its
provisions “by way of an action.” (Ibid.) Where the text does not contain an
unmistakable directive, the legislative history may indicate whether the Legislature
intended to create a private cause of action. (Id. at p. 598.)
       Plaintiff asserts section 17604 of the automatic renewal law clearly shows intent to
create a private right of action. Entitled “Violations; Civil remedies,” that section
provides: “violation of this article shall not be a crime. However, all available civil
remedies that apply to a violation of this article may be employed.” Plaintiff reads the
reference to “all available civil remedies” to mean that a private party can sue for any
remedies available under the civil law, such as damages or an injunction. Plaintiff’s
interpretation is not unreasonable. While a remedy is not the same thing as a cause of
action, a statute that says all available remedies can be employed for a violation suggests
a right of action exists, since one cannot obtain a remedy without a viable cause of action.
       At the same time, we are mindful there must be a “clear, understandable,
unmistakable” indication of intent to allow a private right of action. It is not enough that
the statutory text suggests such a right. (See Lu, supra, 50 Cal.4th 592 at p. 597.) A
clear indication means the text cannot be reasonably susceptible of competing
interpretations. The language here is susceptible of more than one meaning. As we have
noted, plaintiff’s interpretation is plausible. But so is the one urged by Google—that the
phrase “all available civil remedies … may be employed” does not mean what plaintiff
says but rather the opposite: it specifically indicates an intent not to create a new cause
of action but to require enforcement through existing means (such as through Business
and Professions Code section 17200, et seq., which allows individuals harmed by
unlawful business practices to seek restitution and injunctive relief). We find that the
statute’s somewhat imprecise phrasing—“all available civil remedies that apply to a
                                              3
violation of this article may be employed”—is not sufficiently clear to conclude in the
affirmative that a private individual may sue for a violation.
       Plaintiff argues general rules of statutory interpretation, such as the rule against
surplusage, dictate that the reference to remedies should be given effect as creating a
cause of action. But a more specific rule controls in this context: the rule that in order to
create a private right of action the Legislature must clearly express that intent.
       Section 17603 similarly contains no clear indication of intent to create a private
right to sue. Section 17603 provides that “any goods, wares, merchandise, or products”
sent to a consumer under a subscription agreement that violates the automatic renewal
law “shall for all purposes be deemed an unconditional gift to the consumer, who may
use or dispose of the same in any manner he or she sees fit.” That provision relieves the
consumer of any obligation to return what has already been received and ensures the
consumer has no liability for the products. But it does not follow from that language (at
least not with sufficient clarity) that a consumer may affirmatively bring an action to
enforce the statute. That is in contrast to the statute considered in Goehring v. Chapman
University (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 353, 377, cited by plaintiff. There the court found a
private right of action in Business and Professions Code section 6061, subdivision (h),
which requires certain disclosures by unaccredited law schools and mandates that any
school in violation “shall make a full refund of all fees paid by students.” As the
Legislature “unquestionably intended to bestow students or former students with
individual monetary claims, it must have intended to give them private rights of action to
pursue such claims.” (Goehring v Chapman University, at p. 378.) Section 17603 is
different because it provides only a passive right to retain any products received from a
violator, rather than a right to pursue a refund of fees a claimant could show had been
paid. We also note that Goehring was decided several years before Lu, and therefore did
not apply the Supreme Court’s guidance regarding the clarity with which the Legislature
must express its intent to create a private right of action.
                                               4
       We draw further support for our conclusion that the statutory text does not show
an intent to create a private cause of action from the fact that the Legislature has in many
instances demonstrated its ability to clearly express such an intent. Numerous statutes
contain clear, unmistakable language regarding private enforcement that is much more
explicit than the language used here. (See Lu, supra, 50 Cal.4th 592, 597, listing statutes
with a private right of action including Health & Saf. Code, § 1285, subd. (c) [“Any
person who is detained in a health facility solely for the nonpayment of a bill has a cause
of action against the health facility for the detention”]; Lab. Code § 218 [“Nothing in this
article shall limit the right of any wage claimant to sue directly or through an assignee for
any wages or penalty due him under this article”]; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17070 [“Any
person ... may bring an action to enjoin and restrain any violation of this chapter and, in
addition thereto, for the recovery of damages”]; Bus. & Prof. Code § 6175.4, subd. (a)
[“A client who suffers any damage as the result of a violation of this article by any
lawyer may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain one or more of the
following remedies”]; Civ. Code, § 1748.7, subd. (d) [“Any person injured by a violation
of this section may bring an action for the recovery of damages, equitable relief, and
reasonable attorney's fees and costs”].) Had the Legislature wanted to create a private
right of action for violation of the automatic renewal law, it could have said so. We find
its choice not to is significant.

       But even without clear statutory language, legislative history can reveal the
Legislature’s intent to create a private right of action. 1 (Lu, supra, 50 Cal.4th 592, 598.)
Again though, it must be “clear” that was the intent. (Id. at p. 597.) The legislative
history of the automatic renewal law contains no clear statement about an individual’s
right to sue under the statute. There is no mention of a private right action at all. And the
relevant material does not support plaintiff’s argument. Under a heading that reads

       We grant plaintiff’s request for judicial notice of the legislative history of the
       1

automatic renewal law.
                                              5
“Remedies available under the bill”—where one would expect reference to a private right
of action if one were contemplated—the bill’s author instead notes violations can be
enforced through Business and Professions Code section 17200, which allows a private
party to “bring a civil action for injunctive relief and/or for restitution of profits that the
defendant unfairly obtained from that party.” (Sen. Ellen Corbett, Chair of Senate
Judiciary Committee, letter to Sen. Yee, 2009-2010 reg. session.) The legislative
history’s reference to enforcement by way of a different statute is a strong indication that
no independent private right of action was intended by the new law.
       Seeing no clear indication of intent to create a private right of action in either the
statutory text or its legislative history, we conclude there is no such right under the
automatic renewal law. Plaintiff urges that outcome is contrary to the remedial purpose
of the statute and will undermine its consumer protection function. But the automatic
renewal law can be enforced with an action brought by the Attorney General. A private
individual can also pursue enforcement through an unfair competition lawsuit, if
economic loss resulted from the violation—an issue we turn to next.

   B. STANDING TO SUE FOR UNFAIR COMPETITION REQUIRES ACTUAL INJURY AND
      CAUSATION
       In addition to his claim for violation of the automatic renewal law, plaintiff alleged
a cause of action against Google under Business and Professions Code, section 17200,
et seq., which prohibits unfair competition. “Section 17200 ‘borrows’ violations from
other laws by making them independently actionable as unfair competitive practices.”
(Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1143.) The
statutory violation plaintiff imports here is Google’s alleged violation of the automatic
renewal law.

       The unfair competition statutes come with an express standing requirement,
however. An action can be brought only “by a person who has suffered injury in fact and
has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.” (§ 17204.) It is not
                                                6
enough that a plaintiff lost money; to have standing, there must be a causal link between
the unlawful practice and the loss. (Hall v. Time, Inc. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 847, 849[“We hold the phrase ‘as a result of’ in the [Unfair Competition Law] imposes a
causation requirement; that is, the alleged unfair competition must have caused the
plaintiff to lose money or property.”].)
       The statutory violations alleged by plaintiff are that Google did not provide
required disclosures and did not make it easy enough to cancel the subscribed service. To
establish standing, plaintiff would also need to allege that he ordered increased Google
Drive storage but would not have done so had the disclosures been provided, or that he
would have cancelled the additional storage had it been easier to do so. (See, e.g.,
Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 317 (Kwikset) [plaintiffs who can
truthfully allege they were deceived by a product’s label into purchasing the product and
would not have purchased it otherwise, have “lost money or property” within the
meaning of section 17204].) But plaintiff makes no such allegation, which suggests he
would have purchased and maintained the added Google Drive capacity even if Google
had complied with the automatic renewal law. The complaint therefore does not show a
causal link between plaintiff’s payments and Google’s alleged violations. (Daro v.
Superior Court (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1098 [“In short, there must be a causal
connection between the harm suffered and the unlawful business activity. That causal
connection is broken when a complaining party would suffer the same harm whether or
not a defendant complied with the law.”].)
       Plaintiff contends he has standing based on the unconditional gift provision of the
automatic renewal law, which allows a consumer to keep “any goods, wares,
merchandise, or products” sent under a continuous service agreement that is not in
compliance with the law. (§ 17603.) Any such goods “shall for all purposes be deemed
an unconditional gift to the consumer, who may use or dispose of the same in any manner
he or she sees fit without any obligation whatsoever on the consumer’s part to the
                                             7
business, including, but not limited to, bearing the cost of, or responsibility for, shipping
any goods, wares, merchandise, or products to the business.” (Ibid.) In plaintiff’s view,
the effect of that provision is that he paid for a product the law deems a gift. In other
words, he asserts that he lost money as a direct result of Google’s alleged statutory
violation because he paid for something he did not need to pay for.
       Plaintiff’s standing argument misses the crucial requirement of causation. The
unconditional gift provision of the automatic renewal law creates a right to retain a
product already received. That right is a consequence of violating the statute. But a
consequence imposed on a defendant for violating a statute is not the same thing as a loss
caused by the defendant’s conduct. (Kwikset, supra, 51 Cal.4th 310, 335–336 [eligibility
for a remedy and standards for causation under section 17200 are “wholly distinct”].)
The relevant inquiry for standing purposes is whether a defendant’s unlawful conduct
caused the plaintiff to part with money. In the context of this case, the questions are
twofold: whether Google’s failure to adequately disclose that the Google Drive storage
plan would automatically renew each month caused plaintiff to spend money he
otherwise would not have spent; or alternatively, whether Google’s failure to provide an
easy cancellation mechanism caused plaintiff to continue to spend money on a service he
would have discontinued (which he characterizes as a gift under the law).
       Whether a loss was caused by the defendant is what matters for standing, not any
resulting consequence imposed by statute. An example demonstrates the point: suppose
the automatic renewal law imposed a statutory penalty of $1,000 for each violation. The
mere existence of the penalty—a consequence of violating the statute—does not mean the
defendant caused a consumer’s loss that is separate and distinct from the penalty. An
after-the-fact right provided by the Legislature cannot amount to causation. Nor should a
penalty imposed on a vendor be viewed as the source of injury to a consumer.
       Plaintiff cites two federal district court cases and an unpublished Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals case which concluded the unconditional gift provision does confer
                                              8
section 17200 standing. But we are not persuaded by the reasoning in those cases. In
Roz v. Nestle Waters North America, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2017) 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5177,
the court’s basis for finding standing was that “[w]hen the Defendant then collected
money in return for that ‘gift,’ it injured the Plaintiffs because it took money that the
Plaintiffs did not owe. Therefore, the charges must qualify as an injury.” (Id. at p. 22).
The Roz court’s analysis ignores the requirement that the consumer’s injury must be
caused by the defendant’s misconduct; that is, caused by the defendant’s failure to
provide the required disclosures. Lack of a causal link between the underlying statutory
violation and the nature of the plaintiff’s loss precludes standing under section 17200.
The other district court case plaintiff cites, Lopez v. Stages of Beauty (S.D. Cal. 2018)
307 F.Supp. 3d 1058, 1070, relies on Roz and applies the same reasoning.
       In Johnson v. Pluralsight, LLC (9th Cir. 2018) 728 Fed.Appx. 674, 676–677, the
Ninth Circuit decided a plaintiff asserting a section 17200 claim premised on an
automatic renewal law violation established standing in federal court under Article III of
the United States Constitution, and the court summarily concluded that “for the same
reasons he has satisfied Article III’s injury-in-fact requirement, he has alleged an injury
in fact sufficient to support statutory standing under [section 17200].” But federal
Article III standing is far broader than the standing requirement contained in
section 17200, which expressly requires a financial loss caused by the defendant’s
conduct. As the California Supreme Court explained in Kwikset, supra, 
51 Cal.4th 310,324, “because economic injury is but one among many types of injury in fact, the []
requirement that injury be economic renders standing under section 17204 substantially
narrower than federal standing under article III, section 2 of the United States
Constitution, which may be predicated on a broader range of injuries.” The Johnson
court’s conclusion that the plaintiff had section 17200 standing rests on a faulty premise.
       Because we conclude that the unconditional gift provision of the automatic
renewal law does not confer standing for a section 17200 cause of action, we need not
                                              9
reach the issue of whether the gift provision applies only to tangible goods and not to a
data storage plan like Google Drive.
       Plaintiff has no private cause of action under the automatic renewal law, and he
has not properly alleged causation of an economic loss as required to bring a claim under
section 17200. The trial court therefore correctly sustained Google’s demurrer to the
complaint. And as plaintiff has not shown how he would amend the complaint to change
its legal effect, there was no abuse of discretion in denying leave to amend. (Rosen v.
St. Joseph Hospital of Orange County (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 453, 458.)
                                  III.   DISPOSITION
       The judgment is affirmed. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.

                          Industrial Accident Board,
                               AFFIRMED.

Delaware. Attorney for Claimant Below- Appellant and Cross Appellee.

Attorney for Employer Below- Appellee and Cross-Appellant.




BUTLER, R.J.
                                   Background

        This matter is an appeal and cross appeal from decisions of the Delaware

Industrial Accident Board (“IAB” or “Board”) concerning a claim made by

Claimant, Matthew Hoskins (“Claimant”) and his then employer, Appellee

Amazon.com (“Employer”).

        Claimant was working as a “picker” at an Amazon fulfillment center in

Middletown, Delaware. In August, 2021, while so engaged, he was bending over a

bottom bin when a coworker reached up behind him to retrieve items from the top

of the bin, dislodging some merchandise boxes that then fell and hit Claimant on his

back. He reported the injury but continued to work for Amazon for another 5 months

or so, eventually quitting on account of his continuing complaints about his back

pain.

        After the August injury, Claimant saw Doctor Balu for treatment of his back

pain. Dr. Balu took a medical history from Claimant and reviewed a recent MRI,

noting “lumbar lordosis and bulging discs at the L5-S1 level” as well as a herniated

disc at the L4-5 level. Claimant was treated with injections and put on work

restrictions.

        In the face of continued complaints of pain, Dr. Balu gave Claimant anti-

inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxers and further injections.


                                         1
      Claimant also consulted a neurosurgeon, Dr. Pulak Ray, who proposed lumbar

surgery “due to severe degenerative disc disease at L4-5 causing foraminal stenosis.”

      The cost of the surgery is what provoked Claimant to petition the IAB for

“Additional Compensation Due.”         Claimant had already been receiving full

disability benefits since leaving Amazon. He now sought an Order from the IAB

that the Employer would be responsible for the surgery bills from Dr. Ray.

      Thus, the critical issue, as discussed by the IAB in its Opinion denying

compensation, was whether the need for surgery was causally related to the incident

in August 2021, when the boxes fell on the Appellant.

                       Procedural History – Issues in Dispute

      While the Court appreciates that the causal relationship between the

workplace incident and the need for surgery on Claimant’s spine is the central issue

on appeal, the pleadings have become further complicated by collateral issues that

are either waived or moot. The following is offered by way of explanation.

      When Claimant filed his claim for Additional Compensation Due, the

Employer countered with a “Petition for Review,” a request to terminate Claimant’s

total disability benefits on the ground that he was physically able to return to work.

Employer had two witnesses to support this claim, a medical expert, Doctor Close,




                                          2
and a vocational expert, Truman Perry, to present a “labor market survey” of jobs

available in the area.

         For reasons not relevant to this appeal, the IAB barred Dr. Close’s testimony.

Despite the Employer’s motion to reargue and/or to continue the proceedings, the

Board’s ruling kept him out of the hearing. Without its medical expert, the Employer

presented the labor market expert anyway, apparently believing the testimony would

support its request to terminate Claimant’s total disability benefits.

         Ultimately, the Board did not accept Employer’s argument that Claimant was

not totally disabled. This rendered the labor market survey of no value to the

Employer and a non-issue in this dispute.

         The Employer filed a cross appeal on the denial of its Petition for Review. It

identified the Board’s refusal to allow the testimony of its medical expert Dr. Close

as its grounds for this appeal. The Employer did not, however, address this issue in

its Answering Brief or otherwise. That issue is therefore waived and will not be

considered further.

         As to the vocational expert who did testify, the Claimant protested the

admissibility of this testimony in its Opening Brief, even though Claimant did not

identify that issue in its Notice of Appeal. 1 The Court has enough to do without



1
    See Notice of Appeal, Trans. ID 70167531 (June 8, 2023).
                                                 3
rendering advisory opinions. The vocational expert was a non-factor in the Board’s

decision.

       Moreover, Superior Court Rule 72 requires that “In all appeals from the

Industrial Accident Board, where the claimant accepts part of the award while

appealing the remainder of the award, the notice of appeal must specify that portion

of the award accepted.” 2 Claimant’s Notice of Appeal not only failed to identify the

admissibility of the vocational expert’s testimony, it affirmatively represented that

the appeal was “limited to the Board’s denial of Claimant’s petition for surgical

authorization” and it was “not appealing the denial of the Employer’s Petition for

Review.”3 Thus, the argument raised in Claimant’s Opening Brief concerning the

admissibility of the vocational expert is not preserved for review.

       Finally, Claimant’s Reply Brief raises, for the first time, an argument seeking

affirmation of the Board’s refusal to permit the testimony of Employer’s expert, Dr.

Close. The problem here is that the Employer did not raise this issue in its briefing

at all, apparently choosing to abandon the question before briefing. The question is

not properly raised or preserved. The Court will not consider an issue raised for the

first time in a reply brief.4

Corp. v. Barton, 2008 WL 142510, at *1 n.5 (Del. Super. Jan. 15, 2008)).
                                              4
         With all of that said, we will now move on to the single issue that is properly

preserved for review.

    I.      The Board’s Ruling Was Supported by Substantial Evidence

               a. Causation is a question of fact.

         Is the causal relationship between the Appellant’s need for back surgery and

his workplace incident a question of fact or a question of law? The case law and the

Restatement are virtually unanimous that causation is a question of fact.5 Thus, the

Board’s conclusion that Appellant’s need for surgery was not caused by his

workplace injury may not be second guessed by this Court.

         Perhaps understanding that this is a problem for Claimant, he says instead that

“whether the Board committed legal error and the opinions of the Claimants treating

doctors should have been rejected is a question of law and is reviewed de novo” 6

citing Duvall v. Charles Connell Roofing. 7

         But that is not what Duvall v. Charles Connell Roofing says. Rather, in

Duvall, the Supreme Court reversed precedent concerning the “unusual exertion”

rule to the availability of worker’s compensation when injuries occur on a worksite.8


5
  See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 434(2); Duphily v. Delaware Elec. Co-op, Inc., 
662 A.2d821, 830 (Del. 1995) (“This Court has consistently held that the issue of proximate cause is
ordinarily a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.”).

  564 A.2d 1132 (Del. 1989).
8
  See id.                                               5
This change was a change of law, not one of fact. 9 Indeed, Appellant’s argument

asks the Court to revisit the Board’s credibility determination that the surgery was

not causally related to the workplace injury and find instead that it was. This is not

something the Court is going to do.

    II.      The Claimant’s Credibility was Properly at Issue.

                a. Claimant misrepresented his medical history to his doctors.

          Certainly, there are diagnostic images that support the fact that the Appellant

suffered from bulging discs and the like. The doctors saw them and testified that

these physical images depict the pain that the Claimant was suffering from. But it

is naïve to suggest that the images themselves tell the whole story. Pain is reported

by the claimant to the doctor, who then goes searching for its source. But the search

begins with the report of the claimant, making the claimant’s credibility a crucial

ingredient in the diagnostic and treatment process.

          The Claimant repeatedly reported to his doctors that he had no prior back

problems, and that all of his pain stemmed from the boxes that fell on him at Amazon




9
  The Court in Duvall held that “[w]e believe that abandoning the unusual exertion rule and its
patent inequities is consistent with the statutory principle that compensation be paid ‘for personal
injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.’ [and that] [i]n the
absence of contrary legislation, therefore, we adopt the ‘usual exertion’ rule. Under this principle,
an injury is compensable if the ordinary stress and strain of employment is a substantial cause of
the injury.” Id. at 1133.


                                                 6
in August, 2021. The medical testimony was predicated on their assumption that

Claimant had not previously sought treatment for back pain.

         But the evidence showed that Claimant had been to Bayhealth Medical Center

in 2014 with complaints of lumbar pain and a diagnosis of mild degenerative

changes. He had a lumbar MRI done. And in 2020, before he started working for

Amazon, he went to the emergency room at Bayhealth, complaining of chronic back

pain. X-rays taken then indicated “back pain at the L4-5 level occurring over six

weeks.” And on a second visit to Bayhealth in 2020, he reported that he “slipped on

the floor and landed on his low back.”

         Thus, three hospital visits, an MRI on his back and X-rays diagnosing pain in

the L4-5 level – the very same location Dr. Ray proposed for surgery – somehow

slipped from Claimant’s memory when reporting his medical history to his doctors.

It is hardly shocking that the Board, in weighing credibility, concluded that

“Claimant's failure to report his prior low back complaints as to his lumbar history,

which was extensive and dated back to 2014, when seeking treatment with Dr. Balu

and Dr. Ray, was crucial to its determination that the lumbar surgery which he now

seeks is not reasonable, necessary, and causally related to the August 2021 work

accident.”10

     Board Op. at 14, Trans. ID 70167531 (June 8, 2023).
                                                 7
       As the Board properly noted in its Opinion, “[w]hether medical services are

necessary and reasonable or whether the expenses are incurred to treat a condition

causally related to an industrial accident are purely factual issues within the purview

of the Board.”11

              b. Claimant’s illicit drug use was not outcome determinative, but
                 certainly did not help his credibility.


       Claimant also complains that the Board should not have considered the fact

that he misrepresented his illicit drug use to Dr. Balu. The doctor prescribed opiates,

among other modalities, to treat Claimant’s pain, yet his screenings showed no

consumption of opiates, but positive consumption of cocaine. Claimant finally told

Dr. Balu that he was trying to quit using cocaine, but only after being confronted.

       Dr. Balu testified that denial of illicit drug use was not unusual in his practice.

Nonetheless, the Board said, his denial “does not support Claimant’s overall

credibility.”12

       Claimant refers the Court to the decision of Lemmon v. Northwood

Construction 13 for the proposition that the Board may not make compensation

decisions based upon his possible substance abuse after the fact. Lemmon involved


11
   Board Op. at 13 (citing Bullock v. K-Mart Corp., 1995 WL 339025 at *3 (Del. Super. May 5,
1995); Keil’s Wholesale Tire v. Marion, 1986 WL 18001 (Del. Oct. 27, 1986)).
12
   Board Op. at 15.
13
   690 A.2d 912 (Del. 1996).
                                              8
a painter who injured his knee in a workplace accident and then fell down some

stairs, allegedly because his knee “gave out,” injuring his back. The Board did not

believe he fell down the stairs because of his injured knee and denied further

compensation, but pointed only to the fact that he had alcohol on his breath during a

doctor’s visit in support of that conclusion. The Supreme Court ruled that alcohol

on one’s breath, months later, was not substantial evidence supporting the Board’s

conclusion that his knee had not given out, causing the fall.

      Claimant complains that there was no evidence that his cocaine use had any

part of his workplace injury or on the opinions of his medical expert, Dr. Balu. That

is true. But Claimant’s credibility in claiming to have forgotten that he had visited

the hospital on several occasions for back pain certainly was at issue.            His

truthfulness in failing to report his medical history of disease to L4-L5 of his lumbar

spine was at issue. Had the Board relied exclusively on his drug abuse to deny him

benefits, this would be a different case.

      But that was hardly the only problem with Claimant’s credibility. Rather, it

was but one factor cited by the Board as a basis for questioning his veracity. In

Lemmon, it was unclear whether the claimant fell on the stairs because people fall

on stairs sometimes or because his injured knee caused the fall. Here, Employer

agrees Claimant suffered a workplace injury to his back and the issue was whether

the planned surgery was necessitated by the workplace injury or another cause – one
                                            9
that he failed to report to his medical experts. It was not improper for the Board to

consider Claimant’s candor in assessing his credibility and his lack of candor

concerning his drug use was an appropriate factor considering his lack of candor

concerning his medical history.

                                   CONCLUSION

      For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the decision of the UIAB

must be AFFIRMED. Since no issue was raised by Employer’s cross-appeal that

is preserved for review, that appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.

      IT IS SO ORDERED.

Before Richman, Graves, and Ramirez, Circuit Judges.
Irma Carrillo Ramirez, Circuit Judge:
       Our prior panel opinion, Amazon.com Servs. LLC v. Nat’l Lab. Rels.
Bd., 136 F.4th 577 (5th Cir. 2025), is WITHDRAWN, and the following
opinion is SUBSTITUTED:
       Amazon appeals the “constructive denial” of its motion for injunctive
relief from “being subjected to [two] unconstitutional administrative
proceedings” before the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”). We
DISMISS this appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
                                      I
       Amazon is a major online retailer that receives, sorts, and ships
products from warehouses called “fulfillment centers.” In December 2021,
the Amazon Labor Union (“ALU”) filed a petition with the NLRB to
represent more than 8,000 Amazon employees at the fulfillment center in
Staten Island, New York. The election was held on April 1, 2022, and a
majority of the employees voted in favor of ALU. The election resulted in
two separate NLRB proceedings concerning the NLRB’s alleged
interference with the union election, Case 29-RC-288020 (the “Election
Case”), and Amazon’s alleged refusal to bargain with the union, Case 29-
CA-318069 (the “Bargaining Case”).
                                      A
       On April 8, 2022, Amazon initiated the Election Case by filing 25
objections, alleging that ALU and the Regional Office had interfered with the
conditions for a free and fair election. On March 31, 2022, the day before the
election, the NLRB’s Regional Director—with approval from the General
Counsel—sought an injunction ordering the immediate reinstatement of an




                                      2
Case: 24-50761       Document: 215-1       Page: 3     Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                 No. 24-50761


employee that Amazon had terminated almost two years earlier. That
employee had filed a charge against Amazon in June 2020, and the NLRB’s
Regional Office had issued a complaint against Amazon in December 2020.
Amazon claimed that the General Counsel should have sought an injunction
as soon as the Regional Office issued its complaint in December 2020, rather
than waiting until the eve of the union election. This “undermined the
integrity of the April 2022 election that the [NLRB] was obliged to supervise
neutrally.” Amazon sought to have the NLRB invalidate the election results
and order a second election.
       Amazon sought to transfer the case to a different, non-conflicted
region, and the General Counsel transferred the matter to Region 28, which
serves parts of Texas. On September 1, 2022, after a 24-day hearing, the
Region 28 Hearing Officer recommended that all of Amazon’s objections be
overruled. On January 11, 2023, the Region 28 Regional Director affirmed the
Hearing Officer’s recommendation and certified ALU as the bargaining
representative for Amazon’s Staten Island fulfillment center. On February 9,
2023, Amazon requested review of the decision, which the NLRB denied on
August 29, 2024.
                                       B
       Meanwhile, because of the election, ALU demanded that Amazon
recognize and bargain with it. It filed a charge with the Regional Office,
alleging that Amazon refused to recognize it or bargain with it as the exclusive
representative for the Staten Island employees. On July 12, 2023, the
Regional Director issued a complaint, which initiated the Bargaining Case.
       On August 23, 2023, the General Counsel moved for summary
judgment on the complaint, alleging that Amazon violated the National Labor
Relations Act by refusing to bargain with ALU until its objections were
adjudicated. The General Counsel also sought an order directing Amazon to




                                       3
Case: 24-50761       Document: 215-1       Page: 4    Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                  No. 24-50761


recognize and bargain with ALU, pay consequential damages as a “make-
whole” remedy for certain Amazon employees, and transfer the Bargaining
Case from the Regional Office to the NLRB itself.
       Later that day, the NLRB granted the motion to transfer and issued a
notice to show cause as to why the summary judgment motion should not be
granted. On August 25, 2024, the day after the NLRB denied Amazon’s
request for review in the Election Case, the NLRB issued an updated notice
to show cause in the Bargaining Case. The updated notice instructed Amazon
to file any supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion on or
before September 13, 2024.
                                       C
       On September 5, 2024, Amazon sued the NLRB in the Western
District of Texas, requesting temporary, preliminary, and permanent
declaratory and injunctive relief. It sought:
       [T]o avoid serious and irreparable harm that it will otherwise
       suffer from being subjected to unconstitutional administrative
       proceedings. Because the structure of the proceedings in
       NLRB Cases 29-CA-310869 and 29-RC-288020 violate the
       United States Constitution under Supreme Court and Fifth
       Circuit precedent, Amazon respectfully brings this action for
       declaratory and injunctive relief . . . .
Amazon also requested an “immediate” temporary restraining order and
that the district court “set a hearing for a preliminary injunction [and] issue
a preliminary injunction” because the NLRB could theoretically issue an
order any time after it filed its supplemental opposition on September 13,
2024. It did not otherwise request that the hearing—or the requested relief—
occur before a specific date.
       On September 9, 2024, the district court informed Amazon that a
local rule required that its application for a preliminary injunction must be



                                       4
Case: 24-50761           Document: 215-1          Page: 5       Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                       No. 24-50761


made in a separate motion. Accordingly, on September 10, 2024, Amazon
moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, again
seeking “immediate relief” because its brief was due by September 13, 2024,
and the NLRB was “poised” to rule “in the imminent future.” Amazon
argued that it faced imminent and irreparable harm because, if the
administrative proceedings went forward, “Amazon will lose its right not to
undergo an unconstitutional proceeding.” That same day, the NLRB moved
to transfer the case to the Eastern District of New York. The next day, on
September 11, 2024, the NLRB agreed to extend Amazon’s deadline to file
a supplemental opposition until September 27, 2024.
        The district court held a hearing on the motions to transfer and for
temporary restraining order on September 24, 2024. Amazon argued that it
needed immediate injunctive relief, because “if the [Bargaining Case
proceeding] goes forward after this Friday and [the NLRB] issues an order
granting the summary judgment, then the constitutional issues . . . are
mooted.” But it did not specifically request a ruling by a specific date.1 The
court specifically asked Amazon how fast it thought the NLRB would issue
a decision. Amazon acknowledged that the NLRB “normally [takes] weeks”
to issue a decision, but it “believe[d]” that “a ruling could issue as soon as
we file a brief” on September 27 because of the “relationship between
[Amazon] and the NLRB.”2 When asked why relief was needed immediately

        _____________________
        1
         Amazon did state that it wanted a ruling that day, but in response to the court’s
question regarding whether it wished to continue the hearing so it could be prepared to also
address the NLRB’s transfer motion.
        2
           Amazon stated that it had asked the NLRB to administratively stay the
Bargaining Case proceeding, but the NLRB refused. The NLRB responded that it was
reluctant to stay the underlying proceeding entirely because “if the Board says [it is] going
to stay our proceedings based on the filing of the Federal Court lawsuit voluntarily, that’s
just going to encourage more and more and more of these lawsuits to be filed.”




                                             5

                                       No. 24-50761


instead of after “a more orderly briefing process, considering the magnitude
of the issues,” Amazon responded that the NLRB could “theoretically . . .
issue an order Monday,” September 30. The NLRB, in turn, represented
that “a period of months, generally, is about as quick as the board can act
given its caseload.”
        The district court afforded the parties leave to raise any additional
points that had not been addressed via letter briefs filed by Friday, September
27. The court stated that it was “going to try to get this out as soon as” it
could. Amazon then asked if the court wanted the briefs by a particular time,
and the court set a deadline of noon. It then adjourned the hearing.
        Two days later, on September 26, 2024, Amazon filed a letter brief
with the district court, “a day ahead of the 12:00 p.m. Central, September
27, 2024, deadline” to give the court “as much time as possible” to consider
its request for an immediate temporary restraining order. It stated its concern
that the NLRB “could” issue its decision as early as Monday, September 30,
and for the first time advised that its “effective deadline” to seek emergency
appellate review was “Friday morning, after which time it would be “forced
to consider its motion for injunctive relief effectively denied because of the
imminence of potential Board action.” The next day, Amazon noticed the
appeal of the district court’s “constructive denial” of its motion for
temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
        On Sunday, September 29, 2024, and while the current appeal was
pending before this court, the district court granted—but stayed—the
NLRB’s motion to transfer.3 It also denied Amazon’s request for a
temporary restraining order. The district court explained that “Amazon has

          In its opening brief, Amazon contends that “[t]he district court lacked jurisdiction
to enter the order, and it has no effect on the appeal before the Court.”

                                 No. 24-50761


failed to establish a substantial threat of irreparable harm if an injunction is
not granted.” Instead, “it predicates its claim based on a claim that the
NLRB may depart from precedent and require it to provide some form of
compensation to employees for their lost opportunity to engage in collective
bargaining.” “This is both speculative and unripe,” the district court found.
       On September 30, 2024, a motions panel of this court administratively
stayed the proceedings before the district court and the NLRB and expedited
the matter to the next available merits panel.
                                      II
       At issue is whether the district court constructively denied Amazon’s
motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
       Under § 1292(a)(1), this court has jurisdiction to review interlocutory
orders, including orders that refuse or dissolve injunctions. 28 U.S.C. §
1292(a)(1). This also includes orders that do not expressly refuse an
injunction but have the “practical effect of doing so.” Carson v. Am. Brands,
Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83 (1981) (citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co.,
287 U.S. 430, 433 (1932)).
                                      III
       Amazon argues that the district court constructively denied its motion
for a preliminary injunction by failing to rule on or before September 27,
2024; as a result, it faced an injury that could not be undone—the NLRB
“consummating a final order in its unconstitutional proceeding.” We
disagree.
       Because “a motion for preliminary injunctive relief ‘must be granted
promptly to be effective,’” a district court’s failure to timely rule on motion
can amount to an “‘effective’ denial.” In re Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce,
100 F.4th 528, 533 (5th Cir. 2024). “[W]hat counts as an effective denial is




                                       7

                                  No. 24-50761


contextual—different cases require rulings on different timetables.” 
Id. at535. “District courts have wide discretion in managing their docket, and they
do not necessarily deny a motion by failing to rule on a parties’ requested
timeline.” Id. “Appeal cannot be achieved simply by asserting that the trial
court has failed to act promptly as wished by a party seeking an injunction.”
Id. “There must be a legitimate basis for [any] urgency.” Id. (citing 16
Charles Allen Wright & Arthur Miller, Federal
Practice & Procedure § 3924.1 (3d ed.)). Another consideration is the
litigant’s “diligence in seeking to expedite briefing and consideration,” such
as whether it has made “repeated requests for a ruling by a specific date.” Id.
       In Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, a group of business associations
sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, challenging a new rule that
required them to print and distribute materials about credit card late fees to
customers and provide notice of mitigating changes by March 29, 2024. 
100F.4th at 531. On March 7, the associations moved to enjoin the rule and
specifically requested an expedited ruling “within 10 days, or as soon as
possible thereafter, to prevent irrecoverable harm.” Id. at 531–32. The
district court did not rule within 10 days and instead sua sponte requested
briefing on venue on March 18. Id. The next day, the associations again
specifically requested an expedited ruling and informed the court that they
would understand the preliminary injunction to have effectively been denied
if it had not ruled by March 22. Id. The district court denied the motion for
expedited review, and without having ruled on the motion, transferred the
case to the District of Columbia on March 28. Id. We held that the district
court had effectively denied the motion for preliminary injunction because
the associations demonstrated a legitimate basis for the urgency, i.e., “the
unusually short timeline for complying with the rule.” Id. at 535. They had
also “repeatedly requested swift review,” including “repeated requests for a
ruling by specific dates.” Id. at 534.

                                      No. 24-50761


                                           A
       We first consider Amazon’s diligence in seeking expedited briefing
and consideration. Id. at 535.
       Here, unlike the business associations in Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce, Amazon did not “[make it] clear from its first filing [on September
5, 2024] that the [final order] was going into effect on an unusually short
timeline.” 100 F.4th at 534. It “made clear” that its deadline to respond to
the NLRB’s summary judgment motion was September 13, and it requested
“immediate” relief because the NLRB could issue an order any time after
that deadline. When it separately moved for a temporary restraining order
and a preliminary injunction, it again sought immediate relief on grounds that
the NLRB was “poised” to rule “in the imminent future,” without
explanation. Unlike Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, Amazon did not
“repeatedly request[] swift review.” 100 F.4th at 534. It never made a
specific request for an expedited briefing schedule, an expedited hearing, or
an expedited ruling in its filings.
       At the hearing on September 24, Amazon expressed its belief that the
NLRB could issue an order as soon as Monday, September 30, but it
acknowledged that the NLRB usually took weeks to issue a decision. And
despite an extended discussion with the district court regarding its need for
immediate injunctive relief, Amazon did not specifically request a ruling by a
specific date. When the district court set a deadline for filing letter briefs on
the same day as Amazon’s extended submission deadline, Friday, September
27, Amazon did not object. When the court stated that it would issue a ruling
as soon as it could, Amazon did not ask if a ruling would be forthcoming by
September 27 or request a ruling by that date. Nor did it advise the district
court that it would construe a failure to issue a ruling by September 27 as an
effective denial of its motion for injunctive relief. Amazon instead only asked




                                           9
Case: 24-50761      Document: 215-1       Page: 10    Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                 No. 24-50761


if the court wanted the briefs by a particular time. On this record, we cannot
find that Amazon made clear its need, as opposed to its wish, for an expedited
ruling by September 27 to the district court at the hearing. Amazon did not
request relief by a specific date—or even expedited relief—until its letter
brief dated September 26, in which it requested for the first time that the
district court rule by the morning of September 27. During oral argument,
Amazon was also unable to identify any other specific request for a ruling by
this date. Amazon has not shown that it acted diligently.
                                      B
       Amazon also failed to establish a legitimate basis for the alleged
urgency. See Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. The
associations in Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce “made clear from [their]
first filing that the Final Rule was going into effect on an unusually short
timeline, which meant the credit card issuers had an unusually short window
of time to comply.” Id. at 534. Here, Amazon’s deadline to file its
supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion was Friday,
September 27. Nothing before the district court indicated that the NLRB
would—or even could—issue a decision as soon as Monday, September 30.
Amazon acknowledged at the preliminary injunction hearing that it normally
takes weeks for decisions to issue; the NLRB stated that “a period of
months, generally, is about as quick as [it] can act given its caseload.”
Although a certain date such as the one in Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce
is not required to show a legitimate basis for urgency, Amazon’s belief or the
theoretical possibility that the NLRB could issue a decision by September 30
does not suffice.
       Finally, this court has also considered the district court’s timeliness
in assessing urgency. Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535(“[G]iven the issuers’ unusually short timeline for complying with the Final




                                     10

Rule or obtaining injunctive relief, the district court effectively denied the
Chambers’ motion for a preliminary injunction by not promptly ruling on it and
instead opting to hear an unrelated motion sua sponte.” (emphasis added)).
See, e.g., United States v. Lynd, 301 F.2d 818, 823 (5th Cir. 1962) (finding
effective denial where the district court conducted a merits hearing on the
injunction motion and the movant “proved without question” its entitlement
to relief, but the district court unduly delayed ruling on that motion). In
contrast to Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, the district court here
conducted a hearing concerning Amazon’s motion for injunctive relief.
During that timely hearing, it specifically explored Amazon’s basis for
urgency. Although Amazon’s request for immediate relief was based only on
its belief that the NLRB could issue a decision as soon as September 30, the
district court stated its intent to issue a decision as soon as it could. And it
followed through by filing its decision on September 29, one day before the
date Amazon claimed on which NLRB “could” issue its decision. But by that
point, Amazon had already petitioned this court for relief.
       A litigant cannot “simply say they need an expedited ruling and then
appeal by claiming effective denial when they do not get it on their preferred
timeline.” Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. Amazon
neither diligently requested consideration by September 27 nor
demonstrated a legitimate basis for the urgency. The district court did not
effectively deny the motion for injunctive relief in failing to rule on or before
September 27. Because there is no effective denial, there is no interlocutory
decision before this court under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1). This appeal must be
dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
                                      IV
       Amazon’s appeal is DISMISSED for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1).

Priscilla Richman, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
        I would hold that the district court effectively denied Amazon’s
motion for a preliminary injunction, giving rise to our interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction. I respectfully dissent. Our court’s decision today says that our
jurisdiction depends on a combination of two ephemeral factors: 1) when will
it be more than “theoretically possible” an agency might act, even though
the agency was free to act when the appeal was taken; how much longer must
a party must wait to appeal—a day, a week, a month—the bar is left to
wonder, at its and its clients’ peril; and 2) how vociferously a litigant must
tell a district court the date by which it needs a ruling. In the present case,
the NLRB could have ruled at any time after noon on Friday, September 27.
The district court was advised early and often of that deadline. Amazon filed
an appeal on Friday, September 27. Yet, the court says no appeal could be
taken until an indeterminate date and time beyond September 27.

        Under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), we have jurisdiction over appeals from
interlocutory orders denying injunctive relief.1 Litigants may also, in certain
circumstances, appeal an otherwise unappealable interlocutory order that
does “not in terms ‘refus[e]’ an ‘injunctio[n],’” but nonetheless has “the
practical effect of doing so.”2 We have also “recognized that simply sitting

constructive-denial cases, we require a showing that the practical or effective
denial “threatens ‘serious, perhaps irreparable[,] consequences’ and can be
effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.”4 This showing serves as
“a safeguard against undue widening of the floodgates which currently keep

ten days; instead, on the eleventh day, the court “sua sponte requested
briefing on venue.”10 On the twelfth day, the plaintiff moved for expedited
review of its preliminary injunction motion and informed the court that if “it
did not receive a ruling by [the fifteenth day], it would understand its
preliminary injunction to be effectively denied and would accordingly seek
appellate review.”11 The district court did not rule by the fifteenth day.12 On
the eighteenth day—four days before the date for compliance—the plaintiff
appealed.13
          We concluded that the district court had effectively denied the
plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction such that we had interlocutory
appellate jurisdiction.14               We reasoned that “a motion for preliminary
injunctive relief ‘must be granted promptly to be effective.’”15 Accordingly,
“[a]mong the considerations when determining whether a district court has
waited too long to rule on a motion is ‘the urgency of preliminary relief as a
means of preserving the opportunity for effective permanent relief.’”16 In this
vein, “[t]here must be a legitimate basis for the urgency.”17 “Thus, whether

a district court fails to act promptly depends entirely on context.”18 We also
emphasized that “[f]or its part,” the moving party “acted diligently.”19
       In Fort Worth, the plaintiff had a legitimate basis for urgency because
“the Final Rule’s fast-closing window for compliance demanded faster
review of the motion for a preliminary injunction.”20 The plaintiff acted
diligently by filing suit within two days after the agency finalized the rule; by
“ma[king] clear from its first filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short
window of time to comply” with the new rule; by specifically requesting a
ruling on its preliminary injunction motion within ten days; by making
“repeated requests for a ruling by specific dates”; and by requesting
expedited briefing.21 Yet the district court failed to rule on the preliminary
injunction motion, but instead “g[a]ve its attention to” the venue issue.22
This amounted to an effective denial of the motion for a preliminary
injunction.
                                        III
       These principles support appellate jurisdiction here. While some of
the operative facts differ in degree, “what counts as an effective denial is
contextual.”23

        Amazon had a legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary
injunctive relief against the Bargaining Case. Impending summary judgment
in the Bargaining Case could moot Amazon’s district court claims,
precluding the district court’s ability to grant any relief. I am persuaded that
this would be “a ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence’” that “can be
‘effectually challenged’ only by immediate appeal” from the district court’s
effective denial of Amazon’s motion.24
        Amazon’s constitutional objections to the Bargaining Case all allege
ongoing subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker. While “[t]hat harm may
sound a bit abstract,” the Supreme Court “has made clear that it is ‘a here-
and-now injury’” district courts have jurisdiction to redress prior to the
termination of an agency proceeding.25 This injury is conceptually distinct
from an injury arising from an adverse agency order, which a party might
challenge—also on constitutional grounds—after the proceeding.26
Importantly, the here-and-now injury “is impossible to remedy once the
proceeding is over” because “[a] proceeding that has already happened
cannot be undone.”27
        Amazon and the NLRB agree that the Board could grant summary
judgment against Amazon after the September 27 show-cause deadline,
including on that same day, and the NLRB acknowledged in oral arguments

that “the administrative proceeding would likely have concluded at that
point had the Board addressed all issues in the case.” In that event, the
“proceeding is over,” and it “cannot be undone.”28 Post hoc “[j]udicial
review of [Amazon’s] structural constitutional claims”—framed as ongoing
subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker—“would come too late to be
meaningful,”29 and the district court would be unable to provide the relief
Amazon requested in its complaint. That is exactly why “preliminary relief
[functions] as a means of preserving the opportunity for effective permanent
relief.”30 Just as in Fort Worth a “fast-closing window for compliance
demanded faster review of the motion for a preliminary injunction,” a fast-
closing window before potential summary judgment in the Bargaining Case
demanded faster review here.31
       The majority opinion concludes that there was no legitimate basis for
Amazon’s urgency because there was no indication that the Board would
issue a decision on the same day as the show-cause deadline.32 To be sure,
the parties dispute how quickly the Board would likely act after the show-
cause deadline, and there is admittedly no guarantee that the Board would
grant summary judgment against Amazon, thus ending the proceedings. But
the prospect that the Board could issue an adverse decision any time after the
show-cause deadline, as the parties agree was possible, presented a legitimate
basis for urgency. In reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority opinion
states that “Amazon acknowledged at the preliminary injunction hearing that

it normally takes weeks for decisions to issue.”33 In context, however,
Amazon’s “acknowledgement” is far from any concession that the Board
issuing a decision soon after the show-cause deadline was a mere “theoretical
possibility.”34 The district court asked, “[H]ow fast do you think the Board
is going to issue a decision?” Amazon responded:
       This would certainly be a guess, although an educated one; but,
       typically, in test of certification proceedings the rulings come
       out fairly quickly, much quicker than in the normal course.
       [The court then stated: “Give me timeframes.”] Normally
       weeks, but given the posture of this case and sort of the nature
       of the—what I’ll call the relationship between our client and
       the NLRB, we believe that a ruling could issue as soon as we
       file a brief.
Even if Amazon acknowledged that it “normally” takes weeks for decisions
to issue, Amazon argued that the NLRB would likely act faster than usual in
its case. Further, we cannot consider the fact that the Board has yet to render
a decision because a motions panel of this court administratively stayed the
Bargaining Case on September 30, preventing the Board from acting.
       Similarly, although the district judge stated during the September 24
motions hearing that he intended “to try to get this [ruling on the motions]
out as soon as I can,” Amazon could not know how long the court would take,
or if the Board would grant summary judgment before the court could act.
Even though we now know that the district court issued a ruling on Amazon’s
request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) two days after Amazon
noticed its appeal, we must consider the context as it existed on September
27—the date on which Amazon had to file its response at the NLRB, thus

making ripe the General Counsel’s motion for summary judgment—not
September 29. On September 27, neither the district court nor Amazon
could know how long the Board would wait to issue a decision in the
Bargaining Case—two days, two weeks, two months, or longer. Accordingly,
I give little weight to the fact that the district court ruled on the motion two
days later.35
       Importantly, I do not see—and the majority opinion has not offered—
any principled way for us to determine whether the district court failed to
“timely rule on [Amazon’s] preliminary-injunction motion”36 other than by
tethering that inquiry to the show-cause deadline. Assume Amazon had not
noticed its appeal on September 27 and assume the district court did not
eventually act on September 29. How long after the show-cause deadline
would have been too long of a delay by the district court? At what point could
Amazon have invoked our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction on an effective-
denial theory? After the show-cause deadline arrived, no one could know,
other than the NLRB, when the Board intended to issue a decision that could
moot Amazon’s district court claims. What was certain was that the Board
could issue a ruling after the show-cause deadline, at its convenience.
       Amazon’s basis for urgency was all the more legitimate given that the
Board had the power to moot Amazon’s claims against the NLRB. To moot
those claims, the Board only had to render an adverse order quickly against
Amazon disposing of all the issues in the Bargaining Case. It is notable that
the Board apparently declined requests to defer its proceedings. According
to Amazon, “[i]mmediately after filing suit, [it] asked the Board to
administratively stay the [Bargaining Case],” but “[t]he Board refused.”

Only after the district court on September 10 scheduled the motions hearing
for September 24 did the Board on September 11 extend the initial show-
cause deadline to September 27—thus setting the deadline after the district
court’s hearing on both Amazon’s motion and the NLRB’s motion to transfer.
Amazon represented to the district court after the motions hearing that it
“again requested” that the Board stay the Bargaining Case, but the “Board
[was] unwilling to do so.” Even the district court at the motions hearing
asked the NLRB why it was not “just agreeing to stay a decision until all this
is handled.” The NLRB responded: “Because the agency obviously has an
interest in continuing its orderly processes.” But that is exactly the point:
the Board’s continuing its orderly processes, which no doubt is a legitimate
interest, could moot Amazon’s district court claims. That potential outcome
provided Amazon’s legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary relief.
                                       B
       The moving party also must act diligently. While Amazon was
arguably less diligent here than the moving party in Fort Worth, Amazon’s
efforts in this context were sufficient.
       Amazon filed suit on September 5—just six days after the Board
issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case—seeking
declaratory and permanent injunctive relief. Although the Bargaining Case
had begun a little more than a year prior, there was minimal action in the
Bargaining Case while the related Election Case proceeded; in fact, Amazon
had argued in response to the Board’s first notice to show cause that the
Board could not resolve issues in the Bargaining Case until it completed the
Election Case. The Board denied review of the Election Case on August 29,
2024, and issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case on
August 30. Amazon had little reason to challenge the effectively paused

Bargaining Case until the Election Case ended, and Amazon promptly sued
once it did.
       Amazon’s complaint also requested a TRO and a preliminary
injunction against the Bargaining Case. The complaint made clear Amazon’s
deadline to respond to the NLRB’s summary judgment motion was
September 13.37 Amazon also emphasized that its “need for a temporary
restraining order is imminent and dire because the NLRB may issue an order
in [the Bargaining Case] any time on or after September 13, 2024.” Amazon
also requested that the court “set a hearing for a preliminary injunction, and,
after a properly noticed hearing, issue a preliminary injunction.”
       On September 9, the court advised Amazon that a local rule required
submitting an application for temporary or preliminary relief in a separate
motion. Amazon filed its motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction on
September 10. Amazon’s motion reiterated the urgency it had raised in its
complaint, emphasizing that “Amazon must file any supplemental
opposition to the original Notice to Show Cause on or before Friday,
September 13, 2024” (bold, italics, and underline in original).
       Both the September 5 complaint and September 10 motion made clear
that Amazon’s show-cause deadline was (initially) September 13, after which
the Board would be poised to issue a ruling on the General Counsel’s
summary judgment motion, potentially mooting Amazon’s district court
claims. Amazon repeatedly emphasized the (postponed) September 27
show-cause deadline at the September 24 motions hearing, even stating at
one point that it “want[ed] the TRO today.” At the end of the hearing,
Amazon represented that “a TRO or preliminary injunction does need to be
granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the” Bargaining

Case “[b]ecause if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an order
granting the summary judgment [motion], then the constitutional issues
again are mooted.” Finally, Amazon’s September 26 letter brief told the
district court that Amazon would consider its motion effectively denied on
September 27.
       In my view, these facts show that Amazon “made clear from its first
filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short window of time” before it needed
injunctive relief, which it “repeated” multiple times.38 I accept that Amazon
failed until September 26 to state expressly that it would consider its motion
“effectively denied” when the show-cause deadline arrived on September
27. But it was indisputably clear from the earlier filings that Amazon, if it
were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, needed a ruling before the
show-cause deadline, after which the Board’s action could leave Amazon’s
alleged injury “impossible to remedy.”39 The NLRB argues that Amazon
tried “to impose a decisional deadline with barely one day’s notice.” Yet
even the district court commented at the motions hearing that Amazon was
“asking [it] to make a major decision on two weeks’ notice.” Given this
statement by the district court, I cannot agree with the majority opinion’s
conclusion that, by the end of the hearing, Amazon had failed to “ma[k]e
clear its need” for an expedited ruling by the show-cause deadline.40
       Ironically, whatever doubt there might have been from Amazon’s
failure to repeat some apparently talismanic phrase earlier, the NLRB’s
September 10 transfer motion made clear that “Amazon can claim that its
motion for injunctive relief has been ‘effectively denied,’ . . . [on] Friday,

                                         No. 24-50761


September 13,” which was the then-operative show-cause deadline. While
the NLRB’s brief in this court characterizes this concession as a suspicion
“that Amazon might seek to manufacture an effective-denial argument,” the
concession at the very least makes clear that the parties and district court
understood by September 10 that Amazon was seeking relief before the
Board-imposed show-cause deadline.
        The majority opinion faults Amazon for failing to object at the motions
hearing when the district court set the supplemental briefing deadline at noon
on September 27.41 I do not believe this means Amazon failed to act
diligently. Amazon had repeatedly made clear—including, by my count, five
times earlier during that very hearing—that it needed relief by the show-
cause deadline.42 Our decision in Fort Worth does not require that Amazon
have repeated its need for relief yet again.
        I do not mean to criticize the district court. “District courts have wide
discretion in managing their docket,” and “plaintiffs cannot simply say they
need an expedited ruling and then appeal by claiming effective denial when
they don’t get it on their preferred timeline.”43 Amazon asked the court to
consider complex constitutional issues on an accelerated timeline, which no
doubt placed great pressure on the court. Notably, unlike in Fort Worth—

injunction does need to be granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the
underlying [Bargaining C]ase. Because if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an
order granting the summary judgment, then the constitutional issues again are mooted.”).

where the district judge sua sponte directed his attention to another matter
entirely—the judge here took some action on Amazon’s motion by
scheduling a hearing and eventually denying the TRO after Amazon
appealed. We have declined jurisdiction where the district court has done far
less because “mere inaction is not an order refusing injunctive relief, and is
not appealable.”44          But at bottom, there was limited time in which
preliminary relief could preserve the district court’s ability to grant
meaningful permanent relief, assuming Amazon was entitled to either. Given
that legitimate basis for urgency, as well as Amazon’s relative diligence
pursuing its precise claims and the uncertainty as to what would transpire
(and when) after the show-cause deadline, I believe the principles in Fort
Worth support interlocutory appellate jurisdiction here.
                                      *        *         *
       For these reasons, I would exercise interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction to reach the merits of Amazon’s appeal. Because the court
instead dismisses the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, I respectfully dissent.

Hoffman, J.
          {¶1}     Plaintiffs-appellants      Taylor     McQueen        and   Guillermo   Martinez,   Jr.

(“McQueen” and “Martinez,” individually and “Appellants,” collectively) appeal the May 23,

2022 Judgment Entry entered by the Licking County Municipal Court, Civil Division, which

awarded them $0 in damages, following a damages hearing held after the trial court

granted default judgment in their favor. Defendant-appellee is Amazon.1

                                  STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE

          {¶2}     On November 25, 2020, Amazon employees delivered a bed frame to

Appellants’ residence. As they were carrying the bed frame into the residence, the

package struck a ceiling light which fell and struck McQueen on the head. McQueen went

to the emergency department at Licking Memorial Hospital.                       She testified she was

diagnosed with a brain injury. McQueen missed several days of work due to her injuries.

McQueen stated she continues to have issues with her memory, difficulty sleeping, and

headaches.

          {¶3}     On May 28, 2021, Appellants filed a complaint in the Licking County

Municipal Court, naming Amazon as defendant.                        Amazon failed to respond to the

complaint. Appellants filed a motion for default judgment on July 23, 2021, which the trial

court granted on August 3, 2021.

          {¶4}     The trial court conducted a hearing on damages on October 11, 2021.

          {¶5}     McQueen detailed the events giving rise to the complaint. On November

25, 2020, while Amazon delivery workers were carrying boxes containing a bed frame

into Appellants’ residence, they hit the ceiling light fixture with one of the packages. As a

Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                        3


result, the glass part of the fixture broke, fell from the ceiling, and struck McQueen on the

head.       McQueen sought medical treatment for her injuries that same day. McQueen

stated, after medical personnel performed a CT scan, she was diagnosed with a

concussion and discharged with instruction to follow-up with a neurologist the following

week. McQueen treated with the neurologist through February, 2021. She indicated she

experienced migraines, muscle weakness and numbness, and difficulty focusing.

          {¶6}    McQueen identified the medical bills she received for her treatment, which

totaled $6,223.50. She stated she had not paid any of the medical bills. McQueen

testified she missed several days of work due to her injuries.2 She also identified her

certified medical records from Licking Memorial Hospital and the neurologist. McQueen

indicated, as of the date of the hearing, October 11, 2021, she continued to experience

migraines, memory issues, and difficulty breathing when she sleeps.

          {¶7}    Martinez testified he was at home, working in the basement, on November

25, 2020, when he heard a loud thud, then McQueen crying and calling his name. He ran

upstairs to her aid. He identified photographs of the ceiling light fixture, before and after

the incident. Martinez conducted an internet search to ascertain the cost to replace the

fixture and the labor costs to install it. He stated a replacement fixture would cost between

$300-$400, based upon his search on various websites. The labor costs ranged from

$95 to $230.          Martinez also described McQueen’s initial injuries and the lingering

symptoms she suffered as a result of the incident.

          {¶8}    Following a brief argument by counsel for Appellants, the trial court took the

matter under advisement.



2
    The record fails to establish the amount of wages McQueen claims to have lost.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                 4


      {¶9}    Via Judgment Entry filed May 23, 2022, the trial court awarded no damages

to Appellants. The trial court found the documents and records pertaining to McQueen’s

medical treatment and diagnosis were inadmissible hearsay and not properly

authenticated. The trial court further found the evidence presented relative to McQueen’s

medical bills and lost wages lacked specificity and documentation, and the evidence

relative to the replacement and installation of a new ceiling light fixture was vague and

ambiguous.

      {¶10} It is from this judgment entry Appellants appeal, raising the following

assignments of error:



              THE TRIAL COURT’S ORDER AWARDING $0 DAMAGES AFTER

      A DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE

      EVIDENCE. JUDGMENT ENTRY DATED MAY 23, 2022, P. 6.



      {¶11} This case comes to us on the accelerated calendar. App. R. 11.1, which

governs accelerated calendar cases, provides, in pertinent part:



              (E) Determination and judgment on appeal

              The appeal will be determined as provided by App. R. 11.1. It shall

      be sufficient compliance with App. R. 12(A) for the statement of the reason

      for the court's decision as to each error to be in brief and conclusionary

      form.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                   5


              The decision may be by judgment entry in which case it will not be

        published in any form.



        {¶12} This appeal shall be considered in accordance with the aforementioned

rule.

                                                  I

        {¶13} In their sole assignment of error, Appellants contend the trial court’s order

awarding $0 in damages following default judgment was against the manifest weight of

the evidence. Specifically, Appellants assert the trial court erred in requiring expert

medical testimony to establish McQueen’s injury and damages. Appellant further argue

the trial court erred in awarding $0 in damages for the ceiling light fixture.

        {¶14} In its May 23, 2022 Judgment Entry, the trial court stated:



              [T]he Court has already found the defendant corporation to be liable

        for the damages caused by the delivery personnel who damaged the ceiling

        light and injured McQueen. In attempting to establish damages, the plaintiff

        sought to introduce documents and records pertaining to McQueen’s

        medical treatment. The Court and plaintiff’s counsel discussed the issues

        of admissibility as to hearsay considerations. The plaintiffs rely on Rule

        803(6) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and R.C. 3701.75 for the proposition

        that the medical records may be admitted into evidence and considered by

        the Court to determine damages.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                 6


             This reliance, however[,] is misplaced. While the rules of evidence

      allow for the admission of a record made of conditions at or near the time

      they occur, by a person with knowledge, which are kept in the regular

      course of a business, “the great weight of authority in Ohio holds that

      medical opinions and diagnoses are not within the hearsay exception of

      Ruld [sic] 803(6).” Williams v. Minute Men Select, Inc., 5th Dist. Tuscarawas

      Nos. 2016 AP 03 0016 and 2016 AP 04 0020, 2016-Ohio-7509, quoting

      Melton v. Gray, 5th Dist. Licking No. 15-CA-33, 2016-Ohio-194.

             The Fifth District Court of Appeals has applied a multipronged test to

      assess the admissibility of medical diagnoses and opinions through the

      “regularly kept records” exception to the hearsay rule.

             **

             Although Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 9-a and 9-b, the medical records of

      McQueen’s treatment and diagnosis, have a certification from an LMH

      employee that is notarized, the records do not meet all of the criteria

      required by the Court of Appeals to render them admissible. Of note, there

      is no indication that the diagnosis was made based on well-known and

      accepted objective testing and examining practices which are not of such a

      technical nature as to require cross-examination.

             As for authentication, the records are lacking as well.

             **

             The Court finds that the records do not qualify as an electronic health

      care record. Furthermore, the records in Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 9-a, 9-b, and 10
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                    7


      appear to contain electronic signatures of the health care professionals who

      treated McQueen. However, the plaintiffs have not introduced any evidence

      that the entity responsible for creating and maintaining the records have

      adopted a policy that permits the use of electronic signatures. Nor have

      they established that the policy meets all of the statutory requirements to

      permit authentication of the medical records offered.

             For the reason that the plaintiffs have not established that the records

      of McQueen’s medical diagnosis meet the requirements to qualify as an

      exception pursuant to Rule 803(6) or R.C. 3701.75, Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 9-a,

      9-b, 10, and 11 are stricken from the record.



      {¶15} May 23, 2022 Judgment Entry at 3-6.

      {¶16} It is well established “[a] defendant's failure to timely respond to a complaint

constitutes an admission the allegations in the complaint are true.” Bingham v. Slabach,

5th Dist. Stark Nos. 2008-CA-0085, 2008-CA-0086, 2008-Ohio-5555, ¶ 32, citing Sokol

v. Spigiel, 9th Dist. Lorain App. No. 05CA008839, 2006–Ohio–4408, ¶ 14. “Once a default

judgment has been entered, the only remaining triable issue is the amount of damages.”

Sokol, supra, citing Girard v. Leatherworks Partnership, 11th Dist. Trumbull App. No.

2004-T-0010, 2005-Ohio-4779, ¶ 38.

      {¶17} In their complaint, Appellants alleged “[a]s a direct and proximate result of

[Amazon’s] negligence, . . . McQueen . . . suffered serious bodily injury, which required

medical care and treatment.”     Complaint at ¶ 16.      When Amazon failed to file its

responsive pleading, it admitted all of the allegations set forth therein; therefore,
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                         8


Appellants were not required to present medical testimony or expert witness testimony to

establish causation.

       {¶18} “In conducting a hearing on damages, the trial court has broad discretion in

assessing the weight and credibility of the evidence of damages.” Skiver v. Wilson, 2018-

Ohio-3795, 119 N.E.3d 969, ¶ 18 (Citation omitted). A trial court is free to believe “all,

part, or none of the testimony of any witness who appeared before it,” and “the mere fact

that testimony is uncontroverted does not necessarily require a trier of fact to accept the

evidence if [it] found that the testimony was not credible.” Bradley v. Cage, 9th Dist.

Summit No. 20713, 2002-Ohio-816, *2 (Citations omitted). “The discretionary review of

the credibility of the witness is to be distinguished from a situation in which the trier of fact

expressly disregards the evidence by concluding that there was no evidence presented

to establish damages. 5500 S. Marginal Way, L.L.C. v. Parker, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.

110736, 2022-Ohio-1071, ¶ 14 (Citation omitted).

       {¶19} In this case, the trial court essentially concluded Appellants did not present

evidence to establish damages, noting:



              Calculating the amount of damages based on the evidence

       presented by the plaintiffs proves problematic based on a lack of specificity

       and documentation. For instance, McQueen testified that the first bill they

       received from LMH was for $7,000.00 or more. Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 8 reflects

       a bill for $6,223.50 but no foundation was laid for its authentication and

       McQueen testified when asked by the Court that she has not paid any out

       of pocket expenses for her medical treatment.              Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 7,
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                        9


       moreover, is a collection of numerous statements which reflect no amounts

       due from the plaintiffs. She also failed to give a definite amount of money

       for lost wages as a result of being unable to return to her job for a week.

              Martinez’s testimony relating to damages for the ceiling light was

       vague and ambiguous. The exhibits clearly show that the plaintiffs are

       calculating their damages as to the light fixture based on internet searches.

       * * * [Martinez] gave a possible range of costs for the replacement and

       installation of the ceiling light. The Court simply cannot calculate damages

       without this specificity. * * *

              May 23, 2022 Judgment Entry at 6.



       {¶20} “R.C. 2317.421 makes the [medical] bills prima facie evidence of the

reasonable value of charges for medical services.” Robinson v. Bates, 112 Ohio St.3d 17,

2006-Ohio-6362, 857 N.E.2d 1195, ¶ 9. Additionally, “Ohio courts have found that, once

a right to damages has been established, that right cannot be denied because damages

are incapable of being calculated with mathematical certainty.” Brooks v. RKUK, Inc., 5th

Dist. Stark No. 2021CA00048, 2022-Ohio-266, 2022 WL 279013, ¶ 55 (Citation omitted).

       {¶21} Hearsay is admissible evidence unless the opposing party objects. It was

error for the trial court to exclude from its consideration Appellants’ evidence regarding

damages in the absence of an objection. Likewise, in the absence of an objection, the

evidence relative to the cost of replacing and installing the ceiling light fixture as testified

to by Martinez was sufficient to establish damages.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                              10


       {¶22} Based upon the foregoing, we find the trial court’s award of $0 in damages

was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, this Court enters final

judgment in favor of Appellants and against Appellee in the amount of $6,618.50, plus

trial court costs.

       {¶23} Appellants’ sole assignment of error is sustained.

       {¶24} The judgment of the Licking County Municipal Court is reversed and final

judgment is entered.

                                 )
               EXPEDITED HEARING ORDER DENYING BENEFITS
       The Court held an expedited hearing on August 13, 2024. Mr. Meener requested
medical and temporary disability benefits for injuries to his neck, shoulder, low back, and
legs. Amazon argued that Mr. Meener did not provide proper notice. The Court agrees and
denies the requested benefits.
                                     History of Claim
       Mr. Meener testified that on April 22 and 23, 2023, he pushed 2,000-3,000 heavy
boxes that injured his back. On April 22, he went to the onsite clinic and received bio freeze
and a heat pack for back pain. Amazon created the workers’ compensation referral
notification, on June 23, that states he went to the clinic on April 22 “to self-treat chronic
back pain” and that he returned to work without incident.
       He testified he knew he had a work injury by April 23 and notified Amazon four
days later, on April 27, by taking a letter to the human resources desk. He spoke with
Anthony, who Mr. Meener described as a human resources manager. Another employee,
Melody, witnessed the conversation. Mr. Meener asked Anthony to give the letter to the
plant manager because his pain made walking difficult, and Anthony agreed.
       Mr. Meener also said that he could not deliver the letter to the plant manager because
he was parked in visitor parking. Additionally, a record of him “punching in” on April 27
shows he was in the building and thus, according to him, shows he delivered the letter on
that date.
       Amazon admitted his presence on April 27 but denied he reported the injury.
Brennan Reeves, the human resources manager, testified by declaration that Amazon has
an electronic system to log all associate engagements. He explained that neither Anthony
nor Melody logged that they were made aware of Mr. Meener’s injury in April 2023.
      Instead, Mr. Reeves stated that Amazon first learned of an injury allegation on June
23, when Mr. Meener completed and signed an “initial report form.”
       After he delivered the letter on April 27, Mr. Meener states he was told to call a
human resources number to report the injury. At one point he testified he called after his
second emergency room visit, on June 10, however, later he said he called the number “that
very night,” referring to April 27. He also said camera footage should have captured him
delivering the letter, but the camera was not working that day. Neither party provided proof
of the human resources call nor the camera allegations.
        In his May 30 petition, Mr. Meener alleged he notified Terrance with Amazon’s
onsite clinic on May 19, but he could not answer why he put May 19 as his notice date. He
testified that everything in the petition was correct, but he did not know the manager’s
name.
                           Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
        Mr. Meener has the burden of proving he is likely to prevail at a hearing on the
merits on his claim for medical and temporary benefits. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(c)(6)
(2023); McCord v. Advantage Human Resourcing, 2015 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS
6, at *7-8, 9 (Mar. 27, 2015).
        An employee must give written notice of a work-related injury within 15 days of
the work accident, unless the employee can show his employer had actual knowledge of
his injury or he had a reasonable excuse for not giving notice within 15 days. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-201(a)(1).
       In Ernstes v. Printpack, the Appeals Board instructed that trial courts evaluating the
issue of notice should consider the steps below:
       A. Did the employee provide timely written notice of the alleged work-
       related injury?
       B. If no timely written notice was provided, did the employer have “actual
       knowledge” of the alleged work-related accident or injury?
       C. If no timely written notice was provided and no actual knowledge has
       been proven, did the employee show a “reasonable excuse” for the failure to
       give proper notice to the employer?
       D. If the court determines that: (1) no timely written notice was provided;
       (2) the employer did not have actual knowledge of the alleged accident or
       injury; and (3) the employee did not prove a reasonable excuse for the failure
       to give timely notice, the claim should be denied and dismissed.
2023 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 25, at *34-35 (June 6, 2023).
        Here, Mr. Meener did not provide timely written notice within 15 days of his injury.
Although he claimed that he gave written and verbal notice on April 27, the Court does not
find his testimony credible nor consistent with the evidence. He completed, and signed, the
“initial incident form” on June 23. Also, he stated he gave notice on May 19 in his petition
for benefit determination. His testimony seemed defensive with no explanations for the
inconsistencies. See Kelly v. Kelly, 445 S.W.3d 685, 694-695 (Tenn. 2014) (discussing
indicia of witness credibility). Further, Amazon had no record of any conversation between
Anthony and Mr. Meener in their system.
       Next, the Court must determine whether Amazon had actual knowledge of the
alleged work-related injury. They did not. He went to the onsite clinic on the day of his
injury but said he needed treatment for his chronic back pain, not a work-related injury.
Additionally, as stated above, the Court did not find Mr. Meener’s testimony of verbal
notice on April 27 credible.
        The final question is whether Mr. Meener provided a reasonable excuse for his
failure to give timely notice. Mr. Meener did not argue reasonable excuse for his failure to
give timely notice, as he claimed he gave timely notice.
        The Court holds that Mr. Meener is unlikely to prevail at a hearing on the merits on
the issue of timely notice. His request for benefits is denied at this time.
   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows:
   1. Mr. Meener’s request for medical and temporary disability benefits is denied at this
      time.
   2. The Court sets a status conference for October 15, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. The parties
      must call (866) 943-0014 to participate. Failure to call might result in a
      determination of the issues without the party’s participation.
      ENTERED August 22, 2024.

                                          Right to Appeal:
      If you disagree with the Court’s Order, you may appeal to the Workers’ Compensation
Appeals Board. To do so, you must:
   1. Complete the enclosed form entitled “Notice of Appeal” and file it with the Clerk of the
      Court of Workers’ Compensation Claims before the expiration of the deadline.
               If the order being appealed is “expedited” (also called “interlocutory”), or if the
                 order does not dispose of the case in its entirety, the notice of appeal must be filed
                 within seven (7) business days of the date the order was filed.
               If the order being appealed is a “Compensation Order,” or if it resolves all issues
                 in the case, the notice of appeal must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of
                 the date the Compensation Order was filed.
      When filing the Notice of Appeal, you must serve a copy on the opposing party (or attorney,
      if represented).
   2. You must pay, via check, money order, or credit card, a $75.00 filing fee within ten calendar
      days after filing the Notice of Appeal. Payments can be made in-person at any Bureau office
      or by U.S. mail, hand-delivery, or other delivery service. In the alternative, you may file an
      Affidavit of Indigency (form available on the Bureau’s website or any Bureau office)
      seeking a waiver of the filing fee. You must file the fully-completed Affidavit of Indigency
      within ten calendar days of filing the Notice of Appeal. Failure to timely pay the filing
      fee or file the Affidavit of Indigency will result in dismissal of your appeal.
   3. You are responsible for ensuring a complete record is presented on appeal. If no court
      reporter was present at the hearing, you may request from the Court Clerk the audio
      recording of the hearing for a $25.00 fee. If you choose to submit a transcript as part of your
      appeal, which the Appeals Board has emphasized is important for a meaningful review of
      the case, a licensed court reporter must prepare the transcript, and you must file it with the
      Court Clerk. The Court Clerk will prepare the record for submission to the Appeals Board,

Before Richman, Graves, and Ramirez, Circuit Judges.
Irma Carrillo Ramirez, Circuit Judge:
       Amazon appeals the “constructive denial” of its motion for injunctive
relief from “being subjected to [two] unconstitutional administrative pro-
ceedings” before the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”). We DIS-
MISS this appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
                                      I
       Amazon is a major online retailer that receives, sorts, and ships
products from warehouses called “fulfillment centers.” In December 2021,
the Amazon Labor Union (“ALU”) filed a petition with the NLRB to
represent more than 8,000 Amazon employees at the fulfillment center in
Staten Island, New York. The election was held on April 1, 2022, and a
majority of the employees voted in favor of ALU. The election resulted in
two separate NLRB proceedings concerning the NLRB’s alleged
interference with the union election, Case 29-RC-288020 (the “Election
Case”), and Amazon’s alleged refusal to bargain with the union, Case 29-
CA-318069 (the “Bargaining Case”).
                                      A
       On April 8, 2022, Amazon initiated the Election Case by filing 25
objections, alleging that ALU and the Regional Office had interfered with the
conditions for a free and fair election. On March 31, 2022, the day before the
election, the NLRB’s Regional Director—with approval from the General
Counsel—sought an injunction ordering the immediate reinstatement of an
employee that Amazon had terminated almost two years earlier. That
employee had filed a charge against Amazon in June 2020, and the NLRB’s
Regional Office had issued a complaint against Amazon in December 2020.
Amazon claimed that the General Counsel should have sought an injunction
as soon as the Regional Office issued its complaint in December 2020, rather



                                      2

                                 No. 24-50761


than waiting until the eve of the union election. This “undermined the
integrity of the April 2022 election that the [NLRB] was obliged to supervise
neutrally.” Amazon sought to have the NLRB invalidate the election results
and order a second election.
       Amazon sought to transfer the case to a different, non-conflicted
region, and the General Counsel transferred the matter to Region 28, which
serves parts of Texas. On September 1, 2022, after a 24-day hearing, the
Region 28 Hearing Officer recommended that all of Amazon’s objections be
overruled. On January 11, 2023, the Region 28 Regional Director affirmed the
Hearing Officer’s recommendation and certified ALU as the bargaining
representative for Amazon’s Staten Island fulfillment center. On February 9,
2023, Amazon requested review of the decision, which the NLRB denied on
August 29, 2024.
                                       B
       Meanwhile, because of the election, ALU demanded that Amazon
recognize and bargain with it. It filed a charge with the Regional Office,
alleging that Amazon refused to recognize it or bargain with it as the exclusive
representative for the Staten Island employees. On July 12, 2023, the
Regional Director issued a complaint, which initiated the Bargaining Case.
       On August 23, 2023, the General Counsel moved for summary
judgment on the complaint, alleging that Amazon violated the National Labor
Relations Act by refusing to bargain with ALU until its objections were
adjudicated. The General Counsel also sought an order directing Amazon to
recognize and bargain with ALU, pay consequential damages as a “make-
whole” remedy for certain Amazon employees, and transfer the Bargaining
Case from the Regional Office to the NLRB itself.
       Later that day, the NLRB granted the motion to transfer and issued a
notice to show cause as to why the summary judgment motion should not be

                                  No. 24-50761


granted. On August 25, 2024, the day after the NLRB denied Amazon’s
request for review in the Election Case, the NLRB issued an updated notice
to show cause in the Bargaining Case. The updated notice instructed Amazon
to file any supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion on or
before September 13, 2024. The NLRB later extended the deadline to
September 27, 2024.
                                       C
       On September 5, 2024, Amazon sued the NLRB in the Western
District of Texas, requesting temporary, preliminary, and permanent
declaratory and injunctive relief. It sought:
       [T]o avoid serious and irreparable harm that it will otherwise
       suffer from being subjected to unconstitutional administrative
       proceedings. Because the structure of the proceedings in
       NLRB Cases 29-CA-310869 and 29-RC-288020 violate the
       United States Constitution under Supreme Court and Fifth
       Circuit precedent, Amazon respectfully brings this action for
       declaratory and injunctive relief . . . .
Amazon also requested that the district court “set a hearing for a preliminary
injunction [and] issue a preliminary injunction” but did not request that this
hearing—or the requested relief—occur before a specific date.
       After it filed suit, Amazon asked the NLRB to administratively stay
the Bargaining Case proceeding, but the NLRB refused. On September 9,
2024, the district court informed Amazon that a local rule required that its
application for a preliminary injunction must be made in a separate motion.
Accordingly, on September 10, 2024, Amazon moved for a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction. Amazon argued that it faced
imminent and irreparable harm because, if the administrative proceedings
went forward, “Amazon will lose its right not to undergo an unconstitutional
proceeding.” Judicial review of its constitutional claims “would thus come




                                       4
Case: 24-50761       Document: 172-1      Page: 5    Date Filed: 05/06/2025




                                 No. 24-50761


too late to be meaningful.” See Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 202
(2023). Amazon informed the district court that the original deadline to file
its supplemental opposition was September 13, but again, it did not request
expedited relief from the district court. That same day, the NLRB moved to
transfer the case to the Eastern District of New York.
       The district court held a hearing on the motions to transfer and for
temporary restraining order on September 24, 2024. At the hearing, Amazon
acknowledged both that it had not filed its response in the Bargaining Case
and that the NLRB “normally [takes] weeks” to issue a decision. It
expressed its concern that “a ruling could issue as soon as we file a brief”
because of the “relationship between [Amazon] and the NLRB.” Amazon
also told the district court that “if the [Bargaining Case proceeding] goes
forward after this Friday and [the NLRB] issues an order granting the
summary judgment, then the constitutional issues . . . are mooted.” The
NLRB, in turn, represented that “a period of months, generally, is about as
quick as the board can act given its caseload.” Amazon did not request an
expedited ruling or a ruling by its submission deadline, September 27. The
district court requested supplemental briefing by September 27 and took both
motions under advisement.
       On September 26, 2024, Amazon filed a letter brief with the district
court “ahead of the 12:00 p.m. Central, September 27, 2024, deadline” to
file its supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion pending
before the NLRB. In the district court, it re-urged its motion for injunctive
relief and stated that it would be seeking emergency appellate relief unless
the district court granted a temporary restraining order before its submission
deadline, alleging that it would be “forced” to do so “given the imminence
of a Board ruling in the underlying administrative proceeding.” In response,
the NLRB argued that Amazon had not established any of the necessary
elements for an emergency temporary restraining order. The next day,

                                      No. 24-50761


Amazon noticed the appeal of the district court’s “constructive denial” of
its motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
       While the current appeal was pending before this court, on September
29, 2024, the district court granted—but stayed—the NLRB’s motion to
transfer. 1 It also denied Amazon’s request for a temporary restraining order.
The district court explained that “Amazon has failed to establish a
substantial threat of irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted.”
Instead, “it predicates its claim based on a claim that the NLRB may depart
from precedent and require it to provide some form of compensation to
employees for their lost opportunity to engage in collective bargaining.”
“This is both speculative and unripe,” the district court found.
       On September 30, 2024, a motions panel of this court administratively
stayed the proceedings before the district court and the NLRB and expedited
the matter to the next available merits panel.
                                            II
       At issue is whether the district court constructively denied Amazon’s
motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
       Under § 1292(a)(1), this court has jurisdiction to review interlocutory
orders, including orders that refuse or dissolve injunctions. 28 U.S.C. §
1292(a)(1). This also includes orders that do not expressly refuse an
injunction but have the “practical effect of doing so.” Carson v. Am. Brands,
Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83 (1981) (citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co.,
287 U.S. 430, 433 (1932)).


       _____________________
       1
         In its opening brief, Amazon contends that “[t]he district court lacked
       jurisdiction to enter the order, and it has no effect on the appeal before the

                                      III
       Amazon argues that the district court constructively denied its motion
for a preliminary injunction by failing to rule on or before September 27,
2024; as a result, it faced an injury that could not be undone—the NLRB
“consummating a final order in its unconstitutional proceeding.” We
disagree.
       “[W]hat counts as an effective denial is contextual—different cases
require rulings on different timetables.” In re Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce, 100 F.4th 528, 535 (5th Cir. 2024). “District courts have wide
discretion in managing their docket, and they do not necessarily deny a
motion by failing to rule on a parties’ requested timeline.” Id. “Appeal
cannot be achieved simply by asserting that the trial court has failed to act
promptly as wished by a party seeking an injunction.” Id. “There must be a
legitimate basis for [any] urgency.” Id. (citing 16 Charles Allen
Wright & Arthur Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure
§ 3924.1 (3d ed.)). Another consideration is the litigant’s “diligence in
seeking to expedite briefing and consideration,” such as whether it has made
“repeated requests for a ruling by a specific date.” Id.
       In Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, a group of business associations
sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, challenging a new rule that
required them to print and distribute materials about credit card late fees to
customers and provide notice of mitigating changes by March 29, 2024. 
100F.4th at 531. On March 7, the associations moved to enjoin the rule and
specifically requested an expedited ruling “within 10 days, or as soon as
possible thereafter, to prevent irrecoverable harm.” Id. at 531–32. The
district court did not rule within 10 days and instead sua sponte requested
briefing on venue on March 18. Id. The next day, the associations again
specifically requested an expedited ruling and informed the court that they

                                 No. 24-50761


would understand the preliminary injunction to have effectively been denied
if it had not ruled by March 22. Id. Without ruling on the motion, the district
court transferred the case to the District of Columbia on March 28. Id. We
held that the district court had effectively denied the motion for preliminary
injunction because the associations demonstrated a legitimate basis for the
urgency, i.e., “the unusually short timeline for complying with the rule.” 
Id.at 535. They had also “repeatedly requested swift review,” including
“repeated requests for a ruling by specific dates.” Id. at 534.
                                      A
       We first consider Amazon’s diligence in seeking expedited briefing
and consideration. Id. at 535.
       Here, Amazon did not “[make it] clear from its first filing [on
September 5, 2024] that the [final order] was going into effect on an
unusually short timeline.” 100 F.4th at 534. It instead “made clear” that the
deadline to respond to the NLRB’s summary judgment motion was
September 13—and then later September 27—and that a final order could be
anticipated at some point after that deadline. Amazon even acknowledged
that the NLRB “normally [takes] weeks” to issue a decision.
       Moreover, unlike the business associations in Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce, Amazon did not “repeatedly request[] swift review.” 
100 F.4th at534. Amazon “specifically requested a ruling” just once, approximately 24
hours before the September 27 deadline, despite several prior opportunities.
See id. Amazon never made a specific request for an expedited briefing
schedule, an expedited hearing, or an expedited ruling in its filings. Amazon
emphasized in the hearing that it faced imminent and irreparable harm if the
NLRB issued an order granting summary judgment. But despite telling the
court that “a ruling could issue as soon as we file a brief,” Amazon never

                                        No. 24-50761


made a specific request during the hearing for an expedited ruling—or even
just a ruling—by September 27.
       Indeed, Amazon failed to make this request even when specifically
asked for input about next steps and timing. Towards the end of the hearing,
the district judge expressed concern that, if he granted the motion to transfer,
Amazon could appeal his order, and “then we [would] just be back here with
more delay.” He point-blank asked, “[s]o what do I do here, Amazon?”
Despite this prompting, Amazon still made no specific request for a ruling by
September 27. 2 Moreover, before concluding the hearing, the district judge
said that he would allow the parties to file supplemental briefs by September
27. Even when presented with a supplemental briefing deadline that fell on
the date it purportedly needed a decision by, Amazon again failed to inform
the district court of its needs. Amazon did not object or otherwise state the
importance of an expedited decision; instead, it asked the district court
whether it wanted the briefing “by a particular time.” Amazon did not
request relief by a specific date—or even expedited relief—until its letter
brief dated September 26, in which it requested for the first time that the
district court rule on or before September 27. During oral argument, Amazon
was also unable to identify any other specific request for a ruling by this date.
Amazon has not shown that it acted diligently.

           In response to the district court’s question, counsel stated:
       So, I guess a few options. One would be to grant the TRO to give yourself,
       Your Honor, time to write and issue an order. But I think if you’re saying
       your inclination is to transfer venue, which would result in you staying the
       case for an appeal, I think a TRO or preliminary injunction does need to
       be granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the
       underlying case. Because if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an
       order granting the summary judgment, then the constitutional issues again
       are mooted.

       Amazon also failed to establish a legitimate basis for the alleged
urgency. See Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. September
27 was Amazon’s deadline to file its response to the summary judgment
motion in the Bargaining Case. Nothing indicated that the NLRB would—
or even could—issue a decision that same day. Amazon acknowledged at the
preliminary injunction hearing that it normally takes weeks for decisions to
issue; the NLRB stated that “a period of months, generally, is about as quick
as [it] can act given its caseload.”
       Finally, this court has also considered the district court’s timeliness
in assessing urgency. Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535(“[G]iven the issuers’ unusually short timeline for complying with the Final
Rule or obtaining injunctive relief, the district court effectively denied the
Chambers’ motion for a preliminary injunction by not promptly ruling on it and
instead opting to hear an unrelated motion sua sponte.” Id. (emphasis
added)). See, e.g., United States v. Lynd, 301 F.2d 818, 823 (5th Cir. 1962)
(finding effective denial where the district court conducted a merits hearing
on the injunction motion and the movant “proved without question” its
entitlement to relief, but the district court unduly delayed ruling on that
motion). Here, the district court issued its decision one business day after
supplemental briefing was complete, but by that point, Amazon had already
petitioned this court for relief.
       A litigant cannot “simply say they need an expedited ruling and then
appeal by claiming effective denial when they do not get it on their preferred
timeline.” Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. Amazon
neither diligently requested consideration by September 27 nor
demonstrated a legitimate basis for the urgency. The district court did not
effectively deny the motion for injunctive relief in failing to rule on or before

decision before this court under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1). This appeal must be
dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Priscilla Richman, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
       I would hold that the district court effectively denied Amazon’s
motion for a preliminary injunction, giving rise to our interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction. Because the court concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.
                                              I
       Under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), we have jurisdiction over appeals from
interlocutory orders denying injunctive relief. 1 Litigants may also, in certain
circumstances, appeal an otherwise unappealable interlocutory order that
does “not in terms ‘refus[e]’ an ‘injunctio[n],’” but nonetheless has “the
practical effect of doing so.” 2 We have also “recognized that simply sitting
on a preliminary-injunction motion for too long can effectively deny it.” 3 In
constructive-denial cases, we require a showing that the practical or effective
denial “threatens ‘serious, perhaps irreparable[,] consequences’ and can be
effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.” 4 This showing serves as
“a safeguard against undue widening of the floodgates which currently keep

       We recently discussed how to “determine whether the district court’s
inaction . . . amounts to an ‘effective’ denial” in In re Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce. 6 There, the plaintiff filed suit challenging a new administrative
rule two days after the agency finalized the rule. 7 The new rule required the
plaintiff to take steps toward compliance twenty-two days later. 8 The
plaintiff immediately moved for a preliminary injunction, expressly
requesting a ruling within ten days. 9 The district court did not rule within
ten days; instead, on the eleventh day, the court “sua sponte requested
briefing on venue.” 10 On the twelfth day, the plaintiff moved for expedited
review of its preliminary injunction motion and informed the court that if “it
did not receive a ruling by [the fifteenth day], it would understand its
preliminary injunction to be effectively denied and would accordingly seek
appellate review.” 11 The district court did not rule by the fifteenth day. 12 On

the eighteenth day—four days before the date for compliance—the plaintiff
appealed. 13
       We concluded that the district court had effectively denied the
plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction such that we had interlocutory
appellate jurisdiction. We reasoned that “a motion for preliminary injunctive
relief ‘must be granted promptly to be effective.’” 14 Accordingly, “[a]mong
the considerations when determining whether a district court has waited too
long to rule on a motion is ‘the urgency of preliminary relief as a means of
preserving the opportunity for effective permanent relief.’” 15 In this vein,
“[t]here must be a legitimate basis for the urgency.” 16 “Thus, whether a
district court fails to act promptly depends entirely on context.” 17 We also
emphasized that “[f]or its part,” the moving party “acted diligently.” 18
       In Fort Worth, the plaintiff had a legitimate basis for urgency because
“the Final Rule’s fast-closing window for compliance demanded faster
review of the motion for a preliminary injunction.” 19 The plaintiff acted
diligently by filing suit within two days after the agency finalized the rule; by
“ma[king] clear from its first filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short

window of time to comply” with the new rule; by specifically requesting a
ruling on its preliminary injunction motion within ten days; by making
“repeated requests for a ruling by specific dates”; and by requesting
expedited briefing. 20 Yet the district court failed to rule on the preliminary
injunction motion, but instead “g[a]ve its attention to” the venue issue. 21
This amounted to an effective denial of the motion for a preliminary
injunction.
                                        III
       These principles support appellate jurisdiction here. While some of
the operative facts differ in degree, “what counts as an effective denial is
contextual.” 22

       Amazon had a legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary
injunctive relief against the Bargaining Case. Impending summary judgment
in the Bargaining Case could moot Amazon’s district court claims,
precluding the district court’s ability to grant any relief. I am persuaded that
this would be “a ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence’” that “can be
‘effectually challenged’ only by immediate appeal” from the district court’s
effective denial of Amazon’s motion. 23
       Amazon’s constitutional objections to the Bargaining Case all allege
ongoing subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker. While “[t]hat harm may

sound a bit abstract,” the Supreme Court “has made clear that it is ‘a here-
and-now injury’” that district courts have jurisdiction to redress prior to the
termination of an agency proceeding. 24 This injury is conceptually distinct
from an injury arising from an adverse agency order, which a party might
challenge—also on constitutional grounds—after the proceeding. 25
Importantly, the here-and-now injury “is impossible to remedy once the
proceeding is over” because “[a] proceeding that has already happened
cannot be undone.” 26
       Amazon and the NLRB agree that the Board could grant summary
judgment against Amazon after the September 27 show-cause deadline,
including on that same day, 27 and the NLRB acknowledged in oral
arguments that “the administrative proceeding would likely have concluded
at that point had the Board addressed all issues in the case.” 28 In that event,
the “proceeding is over,” and it “cannot be undone.” 29 Post hoc “[j]udicial
review of [Amazon’s] structural constitutional claims”—framed as ongoing
subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker—“would come too late to be
meaningful,” 30 and the district court would be unable to provide the relief

Amazon requested in its complaint. That is exactly why “preliminary relief
[functions] as a means of preserving the opportunity for effective permanent
relief.” 31 Just as in Fort Worth a “fast-closing window for compliance
demanded faster review of the motion for a preliminary injunction,” a fast-
closing window before potential summary judgment in the Bargaining Case
demanded faster review here. 32
       The majority opinion concludes that there was no legitimate basis for
Amazon’s urgency because there was no indication that the Board would
issue a decision on the same day as the show-cause deadline. 33 To be sure,
the parties dispute how quickly the Board would likely act after the show-
cause deadline, and there is admittedly no guarantee that the Board would
grant summary judgment against Amazon, thus ending the proceedings. But
the prospect that the Board could issue an adverse decision any time after the
show-cause deadline, as the parties agree was possible, presented a legitimate
basis for urgency. In reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority opinion
states that “Amazon acknowledged at the preliminary injunction hearing that
it normally takes weeks for decisions to issue.” 34 In context, however,
Amazon’s “acknowledgement” is far from any concession. The district
court asked, “[H]ow fast do you think the Board is going to issue a decision?”
Amazon responded:
       This would certainly be a guess, although an educated one; but,
       typically, in test of certification proceedings the rulings come
       out fairly quickly, much quicker than in the normal course.

        [The court then stated: “Give me timeframes.”] Normally
        weeks, but given the posture of this case and sort of the nature
        of the—what I’ll call the relationship between our client and
        the NLRB, we believe that a ruling could issue as soon as we
        file a brief. 35
Even if Amazon acknowledged that it “normally” takes weeks for decisions
to issue, Amazon argued that the NLRB would likely act faster than usual in
its case. Further, we cannot consider the fact that the Board has yet to render
a decision because a motions panel of this court administratively stayed the
Bargaining Case on September 30, preventing the Board from acting.
        Similarly, although the district judge stated during the September 24
motions hearing that he intended “to try to get this [ruling on the motions]
out as soon as I can,” Amazon could not know how long the court would take,
or if the Board would grant summary judgment before the court could act.
Even though we now know that the district court issued a ruling on Amazon’s
request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) two days after Amazon
noticed its appeal, we must consider the context as it existed on September
27—the date on which Amazon had to file its response at the NLRB, thus
making ripe the General Counsel’s motion for summary judgment—not
September 29. On September 27, neither the district court nor Amazon
could know how long the Board would wait to issue a decision in the
Bargaining Case—two days, two weeks, two months, or longer. Accordingly,
I give little weight to the fact that the district court ruled on the motion two
days later. 36
        Importantly, I do not see—and the majority opinion has not offered—
any principled way for us to determine whether the district court failed to

“timely rule on [Amazon’s] preliminary-injunction motion” 37 other than by
tethering that inquiry to the show-cause deadline. Assume Amazon had not
noticed its appeal on September 27 and assume the district court did not
eventually act on September 29. How long after the show-cause deadline
would have been too long of a delay by the district court? At what point could
Amazon have invoked our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction on an effective-
denial theory? After the show-cause deadline arrived, no one could know,
other than the NLRB, when the Board intended to issue a decision that could
moot Amazon’s district court claims. What was certain was that the Board
could issue a ruling after the show-cause deadline, at its convenience.
       Amazon’s basis for urgency was all the more legitimate given that the
Board had the power to moot Amazon’s claims against the NLRB. To moot
those claims, the Board only had to render an adverse order quickly against
Amazon disposing of all the issues in the Bargaining Case. It is notable that
the Board apparently declined requests to defer its proceedings. According
to Amazon, “[i]mmediately after filing suit, [it] asked the Board to
administratively stay the [Bargaining Case],” but “[t]he Board refused.”
Only after the district court on September 10 scheduled the motions hearing
for September 24 did the Board on September 11 extend the initial show-
cause deadline to September 27—thus setting the deadline after the district
court’s hearing on both Amazon’s motion and the NLRB’s motion to transfer.
Amazon represented to the district court after the motions hearing that it
“again requested” that the Board stay the Bargaining Case, but the “Board
[was] unwilling to do so.” Even the district court at the motions hearing
asked the NLRB why it was not “just agreeing to stay a decision until all this
is handled.” The NLRB responded: “Because the agency obviously has an

interest in continuing its orderly processes.” But that is exactly the point:
the Board’s continuing its orderly processes, which no doubt is a legitimate
interest, could moot Amazon’s district court claims. That potential outcome
provided Amazon’s legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary relief.
                                        B
       The moving party also must act diligently. While Amazon was
arguably less diligent here than the moving party in Fort Worth, Amazon’s
efforts in this context were sufficient.
       Amazon filed suit on September 5—just six days after the Board
issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case—seeking
declaratory and permanent injunctive relief. Although the Bargaining Case
had begun a little more than a year prior, there was minimal action in the
Bargaining Case while the related Election Case proceeded; in fact, Amazon
had argued in response to the Board’s first notice to show cause that the
Board could not resolve issues in the Bargaining Case until it completed the
Election Case. The Board denied review of the Election Case on August 29,
2024, and issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case on
August 30. Amazon had little reason to challenge the effectively paused
Bargaining Case until the Election Case ended, and Amazon promptly sued
once it did.
       Amazon’s complaint also requested a TRO and a preliminary
injunction against the Bargaining Case. The complaint did more than merely
make clear “that the deadline to respond to the NLRB’s summary-judgment
motion was September 13.” 38 Rather, Amazon emphasized that its “need for
a temporary restraining order is imminent and dire because the NLRB may

issue an order in [the Bargaining Case] any time on or after September 13,
2024.” Amazon also requested that the court “set a hearing for a preliminary
injunction, and, after a properly noticed hearing, issue a preliminary
injunction.”
       On September 9, the court advised Amazon that a local rule required
submitting an application for temporary or preliminary relief in a separate
motion. Amazon filed its motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction on
September 10. Amazon’s motion reiterated the urgency it had raised in its
complaint, emphasizing that “Amazon must file any supplemental
opposition to the original Notice to Show Cause on or before Friday,
September 13, 2024” (bold, italics, and underline in original). 39
       Both the September 5 complaint and September 10 motion made clear
that Amazon’s show-cause deadline was (initially) September 13, after which
the Board would be poised to issue a ruling on the General Counsel’s
summary judgment motion, potentially mooting Amazon’s district court
claims. Amazon repeatedly emphasized the (postponed) September 27
show-cause deadline at the September 24 motions hearing, even stating at
one point that it “want[ed] the TRO today.” 40 At the end of the hearing,
Amazon represented that “a TRO or preliminary injunction does need to be
granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the” Bargaining
Case “[b]ecause if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an order
granting the summary judgment [motion], then the constitutional issues
again are mooted.” 41 Finally, Amazon’s September 26 letter brief told the

district court that Amazon would consider its motion effectively denied on
September 27. 42
       In my view, these facts show that Amazon “made clear from its first
filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short window of time” before it needed
injunctive relief, which it “repeated” multiple times. 43 I accept that Amazon
failed until September 26 to state expressly that it would consider its motion
“effectively denied” when the show-cause deadline arrived on September
27. But it was indisputably clear from the earlier filings that Amazon, if it
were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, needed a ruling before the
show-cause deadline, after which the Board’s action could leave Amazon’s
alleged injury “impossible to remedy.” 44 The NLRB argues that Amazon
tried “to impose a decisional deadline with barely one day’s notice.” Yet
even the district court commented at the motions hearing that Amazon was
“asking [it] to make a major decision on two weeks’ notice.” Given this
statement by the district court, I cannot agree with the majority opinion’s
conclusion that Amazon “failed to inform the district court of its need[]” for
a ruling by the show-cause deadline until just one day before that deadline. 45
       Ironically, whatever doubt there might have been from Amazon’s
failure to repeat some apparently talismanic phrase earlier, the NLRB’s
September 10 transfer motion made clear that “Amazon can claim that its
motion for injunctive relief has been ‘effectively denied,’ . . . [on] Friday,
September 13,” 46 which was the then-operative show-cause deadline. While

the NLRB’s brief in this court characterizes this concession as a suspicion
“that Amazon might seek to manufacture an effective-denial argument,” the
concession at the very least makes clear that the parties and district court
understood by September 10 that Amazon was seeking relief before the
Board-imposed show-cause deadline.
       The majority opinion faults Amazon for failing to object at the motions
hearing when the district court set the supplemental briefing deadline at noon
on September 27. 47 I do not believe this means Amazon failed to act
diligently. Amazon had repeatedly made clear—including, by my count, five
times earlier during that very hearing—that it needed relief by the show-
cause deadline. 48 Our decision in Fort Worth does not require that Amazon
have repeated its need for relief yet again.
       I do not mean to criticize the district court. “District courts have wide
discretion in managing their docket,” and “plaintiffs cannot simply say they
need an expedited ruling and then appeal by claiming effective denial when
they don’t get it on their preferred timeline.” 49 Amazon asked the court to
consider complex constitutional issues on an accelerated timeline, which no
doubt placed great pressure on the court. Notably, unlike in Fort Worth—

where the district judge sua sponte directed his attention to another matter
entirely—the judge here took some action on Amazon’s motion by
scheduling a hearing and eventually denying the TRO after Amazon
appealed. We have declined jurisdiction where the district court has done far
less because “mere inaction is not an order refusing injunctive relief, and is
not appealable.” 50         But at bottom, there was limited time in which
preliminary relief could preserve the district court’s ability to grant
meaningful permanent relief, assuming Amazon was entitled to either. Given
that legitimate basis for urgency, as well as Amazon’s relative diligence
pursuing its precise claims and the uncertainty as to what would transpire
(and when) after the show-cause deadline, I believe the principles in Fort
Worth support interlocutory appellate jurisdiction here.
                                      *        *         *
       For these reasons, I would exercise interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction to reach the merits of Amazon’s appeal. Because the court
instead dismisses the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, I respectfully dissent.

                    Defendants-Appellees.



          On Appeal from a Judgment of the United States
         District Court for the Eastern District of New York.



                       ARGUED: MAY 19, 2021
                     DECIDED: OCTOBER 18, 2022

         Before: JACOBS, CHIN, and NARDINI, Circuit Judges.



      This case involves claims brought by workers at Amazon’s
JFK8 fulfillment center and members of the workers’ households in
connection with the COVID-19 policies, practices, and procedures at
JFK8. In their amended complaint Plaintiffs allege causes of action for
public nuisance, breach of the duty to protect the health and safety of
employees under New York Labor Law (“NYLL”) § 200, violation of
NYLL § 191 for failure to pay, on time and in full, COVID-19 sick leave
under New York’s COVID-19 sick leave law, and injunctive relief
against future violations of NYLL § 191. The United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York (Brian M. Cogan, Judge)
dismissed Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, relying on the doctrine of
primary jurisdiction, as well as alternative grounds, to dispose of the
public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims, and dismissing Plaintiffs’
§ 191 claim for failure to state a claim for relief based on COVID-19
sick leave payments not falling within § 191’s definition of “wages.”
Plaintiffs now appeal. First, we reject Amazon’s contention that we
should partially dismiss this appeal as moot. Second, we agree with
Plaintiffs that the district court wrongly applied the primary
jurisdiction doctrine to their public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims.
Ultimately, however, only their § 200 claim survives. Accordingly,
we hold: (1) Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are not
moot; (2) the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply to
Plaintiffs’ public nuisance or NYLL § 200 claims; (3) Plaintiffs fail to
state a claim for public nuisance under New York law because they
do not allege a special injury; (4) Section 11 of the New York Workers’
Compensation Law does not preclude injunctive relief under NYLL
§ 200; and (5) COVID-19 sick leave payments are not “wages” under
NYLL § 191. We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of
Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 191 claims; and we VACATE
the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim and
REMAND to the district court for further proceedings on that claim.

opinion.

WILLIAM J. NARDINI, Circuit Judge:

      Workers at Amazon’s JFK8 fulfillment center and members of

their households (together, “Plaintiffs”) challenge workplace COVID-

19 policies, practices, and procedures at JFK8. Their suit against

Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC (together,

“Amazon”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District

of New York (Brian M. Cogan, Judge) asserts causes of action under




                                     3
New York law for public nuisance, breach of the duty to protect the

health and safety of employees under New York Labor Law

(“NYLL”) § 200, violation of NYLL § 191 for failure to pay, on time

and in full, COVID-19 sick leave under New York’s COVID-19 sick

leave law, and injunctive relief against future violations of NYLL

§ 191. Amazon moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint. In

a memorandum decision and order filed on November 2, 2020, the

district court granted Amazon’s motion. On November 3, 2020, the

district court entered judgment dismissing Plaintiffs’ amended

complaint.

      The district court dismissed Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and

NYLL § 200 claims without prejudice under the primary jurisdiction

doctrine, concluding that the questions before the court turned on

factual issues requiring the technical and policy expertise of the

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). In the

alternative, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to allege




                                    4
the special injury required to state a claim for public nuisance; that

New York’s Workers’ Compensation Law preempts suit under NYLL

§ 200 for injunctive relief for past harm; and that Plaintiffs failed to

allege a cognizable injury under NYLL § 200 based on the threat of

future harm.    The district court then dismissed with prejudice

Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 191 claims, concluding that COVID-19 leave

payments are not “wages” as defined by § 191.

      Plaintiffs now appeal the district court’s dismissal. This appeal

presents five key questions: (1) whether Plaintiffs’ public nuisance

and NYLL § 200 claims are moot because they are premised on New

York Forward, a state-issued plan with industry-specific guidance for

businesses that has since been rescinded; (2) whether the district court

correctly applied the primary jurisdiction doctrine in dismissing

Plaintiffs’ state law claims in deference to OSHA; (3) whether

Plaintiffs plausibly plead a special injury to support a public nuisance

claim against Amazon; (4) whether the New York Workers’




                                   5
Compensation Law bars claims for injunctive relief under NYLL

§ 200; and (5) whether NYLL § 191 establishes how and when COVID-

19 sick leave pay must be paid.

      First, we hold that Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200

claims are not moot.      These claims continue to present a live

controversy because they are not based solely on since-rescinded

guidance associated with the New York Forward plan. Second, we

hold that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply to

Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims. The issues before

us—whether Amazon created a public nuisance and whether

Amazon has breached its duty owed to Plaintiffs under NYLL § 200—

turn on questions of state tort law that are within the conventional

experience of judges.     Although it is certainly within OSHA’s

competence to evaluate and create workplace health and safety

standards, OSHA’s expertise would not be a material aid here; the

issues before us are of a legal, not factual, nature and do not require




                                  6
the kind of highly factual inquiry that would typically be aided by

OSHA’s expertise. Furthermore, OSHA has not promulgated the

kind of cross-industry COVID-19 workplace safety standards that

might be applicable here. Third, we hold that although Plaintiffs may

plead a harm that is different in degree from the community at large,

they fail to plead a harm that is different in kind, thereby failing to

allege the special injury required to state a claim for public nuisance

under New York law. Fourth, we hold that New York’s Workers’

Compensation Law is concerned only with claims for monetary relief

and leaves open claims against employers for injunctive relief under

NYLL § 200. Lastly, we hold that NYLL § 191 determines the pay

frequency for “wages” but not “benefits or supplemental wages.”

Because COVID-19 leave payments are not “wages” as defined by

NYLL § 191, Plaintiffs do not have a private cause of action under

§ 191 for Amazon’s alleged failure to comply with New York’s

COVID-19 sick leave law.




                                  7
         Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of

Plaintiffs’ public nuisance claim and NYLL § 191 claims for damages

and injunctive relief; and we VACATE the district court’s dismissal of

Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim seeking a declaratory judgment and

injunctive relief and REMAND to the district court for further

proceedings on this claim.

I.       Background

         We assume the following facts, which are taken from Plaintiffs’

amended complaint, to be true for the purposes of this appeal.

Kolbasyuk v. Cap. Mgmt. Servs., LP, 918 F.3d 236, 238 n.1, 239 (2d Cir.

2019).

         A.    Amazon’s Operations at JFK8

         The JFK8 fulfillment center (“JFK8”) is a facility operated by

Amazon in Staten Island, New York. JFK8 covers approximately

840,000 square feet and runs twenty-four hours per day, seven days

per week. On average, JFK8 employs 3,500 workers at any given time.




                                    8
During peak seasons—the period around Amazon Prime Day in July

and the months leading up to Christmas—the workforce expands to

approximately 5,000. During the course of the pandemic, Amazon’s

national workforce expanded. As of April 2020, Amazon had hired

175,000 more workers to account for increased demand for online

shopping and product delivery.

      Amazon tracks its employees’ activity through devices workers

use to scan items and packages. It uses this information to determine

whether employees are on task and to calculate an employee’s total

time off task (“TOT”) for each shift. An employee’s TOT in a shift is

not to exceed thirty minutes. TOT greater than thirty minutes results

in a written warning; TOT greater than sixty minutes results in a final

written warning; and TOT greater than 120 minutes results in an

automatic termination.       Employees accumulate TOT during

bathroom breaks. An employee’s supervisor must re-code certain

TOT activities to prevent them from contributing to an employee’s




                                  9
total TOT. Supervisors cannot re-code TOT for bathroom breaks, but

they can decide whether to discipline an employee for exceeding TOT

limits because of those breaks.

      B.    New York’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic

      On March 1, 2020, New York announced its first confirmed case

of COVID-19. On March 20, 2020, then-New York Governor Andrew

Cuomo issued the New York State on PAUSE Executive Order. Exec.

Order No. 202.6 (N.Y. Mar. 22, 2020). The Order permitted essential

businesses—those providing products or services required to

maintain the health, safety, and welfare of New Yorkers—to remain

open. Amazon was deemed an essential business.

      In May 2020, New York began a phased reopening of non-

essential businesses under the New York Forward plan. The plan

provided detailed, industry-specific guidance for essential businesses

and non-essential businesses that were permitted to reopen. The

guidance outlined “minimum requirements” businesses needed to




                                  10
follow to remain open. JFK8 was subject to the New York Forward

Interim Guidance for the Wholesale Trade Sector.

      In parallel to the Governor’s executive action, on March 18,

2020, the New York legislature responded to the pandemic by

enacting a COVID-19 sick leave law (the “Leave Law”). See 2020 N.Y.

Sess. Laws ch. 25 (McKinney). The Leave Law requires employers to

pay sick leave to employees who are “subject to a mandatory or

precautionary order of quarantine or isolation issued by the state of

New York, the department of health, local board of health, or any

governmental entity duly authorized to issue such order to COVID-

19.” Id. § 1.1(a). The amount of sick leave an employer must provide

varies based on its number of employees.         Employers with a

workforce of one hundred or more must give at least fourteen days of

paid sick leave during any mandatory or precautionary order of

quarantine or isolation. Id. § 1.1(c).




                                    11
      C.    Plaintiffs’ allegations

      Plaintiffs are warehouse workers at JFK8 and members of the

employees’ households. The employee plaintiffs are Derrick Palmer,

Benita Rouse, Barbara Chandler, and Deasahni Bernard. Their roles

all involve working close to other team members, and most of their

roles include touching items that other workers have handled. The

remaining plaintiffs (together, the “Non-Employee Plaintiffs”) live in

the households of the employee plaintiffs: Kendia Mesidor is in a

relationship with Derrick Palmer, and Alexander Rouse and Luis

Pellot-Chandler are the children of Benita Rouse and Barbara

Chandler, respectively. Chandler and Bernard contracted COVID-19

while employed at JFK8.        Members of Chandler’s household

experienced symptoms of COVID-19, including her cousin who died

in April 2020.

      As the pandemic hit New York in spring 2020, Plaintiffs became

concerned that Amazon was disregarding federal and state




                                 12
guidance—namely, the New York Forward plan, the Leave Law, and

guidance from the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention (“CDC”)—and thereby creating an unsafe workplace

during a global pandemic.

      Plaintiffs allege that Amazon deters workers from social

distancing, washing hands, and disinfecting workstations. Plaintiffs

point to a primary root cause: TOT requirements. Although Amazon

purportedly suspended TOT tracking requirements and productivity

feedback in March 2020, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon did not inform

workers of this change until an announcement on July 13, 2020.

According to Plaintiffs, even after Amazon’s July announcement,

managers continued to post TOT rate goals around the JFK8 facility

and to encourage workers to meet those goals. Plaintiffs assert that

Amazon’s mixed messages and lack of communication concerning

TOT and rate policies discourage workers from leaving their

workstations to wash their hands and from taking time to disinfect




                                13
their work area. Although workers in some departments can re-code

their time to indicate that they are “off task” to address a dangerous

condition, equipment malfunction, or injury, Amazon does not

provide the same re-coding mechanism for employees breaking to

wash hands, social distance, or sanitize workstations.

      Next, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon failed to implement any

policy regarding social distancing. Only two of the breakrooms at

JFK8 are air-conditioned, concentrating workers in those rooms

during the hotter spring and summer months. Moreover, Amazon

changed its break policies, shifting from two twenty-minute breaks

plus lunch per shift to one thirty-five-minute break plus lunch per

shift. Plaintiffs allege this change thwarts workers’ ability to social

distance because more employees are in breakrooms, bathrooms, and

hallways at a given time.

      Plaintiffs further allege that Amazon makes COVID-19 sick

leave inaccessible and fails to pay workers on time and in full under




                                  14
the Leave Law, which encourages workers to forgo taking leave and

attend work while sick.     A JFK8 worker who has symptoms of

COVID-19 or who is exposed to someone with the virus is required to

communicate with Amazon’s human resources (“HR”) team before

taking sick leave pursuant to the Leave Law. The process for learning

whether the employee can stay home is lengthy and confusing.

Plaintiffs recount situations in which they repeatedly called the HR

team but were unable to speak with one of its team members. Once

an employee finally learns that they must quarantine, Amazon fails

to timely provide the employee with full payment of COVID-19 sick

pay.

       Plaintiffs also allege that Amazon’s handling of contact-tracing

fails to adequately track employees who test positive for COVID-19

and the coworkers with whom they came into close contact. Amazon

does not track the symptoms of workers who report exposure to

COVID-19, and it allegedly discourages workers from informing their




                                  15
colleagues that they tested positive for the virus. Amazon also does

not ask COVID-19-positive employees with whom they have come

into close contact at JFK8. Amazon relies solely on surveillance

technology to make these contact determinations, which Plaintiffs

argue is inadequate.

      Lastly, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon fails to deep clean JFK8

and close the facility, whether in whole or in part, after receiving

confirmation that a worker tested positive for COVID-19.

      D.    District court proceedings

      On June 3, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District

Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting claims for public

nuisance, breach of duty under NYLL § 200, and violations of NYLL

§ 191 for failure to pay, on time and in full, COVID-19 sick leave.

Plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which they

subsequently withdrew after Amazon’s announcement on July 13,

2020, concerning changes to productivity policies.

      On July 28, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended four-count



                                  16
complaint expanding their NYLL § 191 claims into a statewide class

action and adding an additional named Plaintiff. In Count I, Plaintiffs

assert that Amazon is creating a public nuisance by failing to comply

with minimum basic health and safety standards at JFK8. Plaintiffs

seek injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C.

§ 2201. In Count II, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon is breaching its duty

to protect the health and safety of its employees under NYLL § 200,

seeking injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C.

§ 2201. In Count III, Plaintiffs seek damages for Amazon’s alleged

failure to timely pay earned COVID-19 sick leave under NYLL § 191.

In Count IV, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Amazon from future failures to

pay earned COVID-19 sick leave on time under NYLL § 191.

      On August 11, 2020, Amazon filed a motion to dismiss the

amended complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)

and 12(b)(6).    The district court granted Amazon’s motion on

November 2, 2020, and entered judgment the following day. Under




                                  17
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the district court dismissed,

without prejudice, Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims.

The court concluded that because the relief Plaintiffs seek “involves

detailed aspects of how Amazon regulates its workplace,” Plaintiffs’

claims turned “on factual issues requiring [OSHA’s] technical and

policy expertise.” App’x at 137. The risk of inconsistent rulings

absent agency deferral and the advantages of applying the doctrine

also tipped in favor of invoking primary jurisdiction.           In the

alternative, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs fail to state a

public nuisance claim because they do not allege special injury, that

Plaintiffs’ claim for past harm under NYLL § 200 is preempted by

New York’s Workers’ Compensation Law, and that Plaintiffs’ NYLL

§ 200 claim based on the threat of future harm fails to allege a

cognizable injury. As to Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 191 claims, the district

court concluded that Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for relief because

COVID-19 sick leave payments are not “wages” under § 191.




                                   18
       On November 24, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.

II.   Discussion

      We review de novo a district court’s grant of a motion to dismiss

under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations in the

complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of

the plaintiff. Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398, 403 (2d Cir.

2015); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). When a district

court invokes the primary jurisdiction doctrine, our standard of

review is likewise de novo. Nat’l Commc’ns Ass’n, Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Tel.

Co., 46 F.3d 220, 222 (2d Cir. 1995) [hereinafter AT&T Co.] (“[T]he

standard of review [of a dismissal on the basis of the primary

jurisdiction doctrine] is essentially de novo.” (citation omitted)); see also

Seneca Nation of Indians v. New York, 988 F.3d 618, 629 (2d Cir. 2021)

(“We review a district court’s decision not to apply the doctrine of

primary jurisdiction de novo.”); Ellis v. Tribune Television Co., 

443 F.3d71, 83 n.14 (2d Cir. 2006) (same).




                                     19
        On appeal, Plaintiffs ask us to vacate the grant of Amazon’s

motion to dismiss, challenging the district court’s conclusions that:

deference is due to OSHA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine;

Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege special harm sufficient to state a claim

for public nuisance; the claim under NYLL § 200 is preempted by

New York’s Workers’ Compensation Law; and COVID-19 sick leave

payments do not constitute “wages” as defined by NYLL § 191.

Amazon moves for partial dismissal of Plaintiffs’ appeal, arguing that

Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are moot because

New York has since rescinded the guidance upon which these claims

rely.

        As a preliminary matter, we deny Amazon’s motion for partial

dismissal. Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are not

moot because these claims do not rely solely upon rescinded New

York guidance, and it is still possible for a court to grant Plaintiffs

injunctive and declaratory relief if they are the prevailing party.




                                    20
Turning to the merits, we agree with Plaintiffs that the district court

wrongly applied the primary jurisdiction doctrine to their public

nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims. But ultimately, as we explain below,

only Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim survives dismissal.

      A.     Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are
             not moot

      As a threshold matter, we must consider Amazon’s motion for

partial dismissal of the appeal on mootness grounds. “[M]ootness

doctrine ensures that [a] litigant’s interest in the outcome continues

to exist throughout the life of the lawsuit.” Conn. Citizens Def. League,

Inc. v. Lamont, 6 F.4th 439, 444 (2d Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks

omitted). If because of changed circumstances “a case that presented

an actual redressable injury at the time it was filed ceases to involve

such an injury, it ceases to fall within a federal court’s Article III

subject matter jurisdiction and must be dismissed for mootness.” Id.
(internal quotation marks omitted). “A case becomes moot when it is

impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the




                                   21
prevailing party.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

       Amazon argues that Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200

claims are moot because the guidance on which these claims rely, the

New York Forward plan, has since been rescinded. 1 We read the

amended complaint differently. Contrary to Amazon’s argument,

Plaintiffs’ claims do not rely solely on alleged violations of New York

Forward guidance. Instead, Plaintiffs use the New York Forward

guidance as one of several guideposts—alongside, for example, the

Leave Law and CDC guidance—for establishing the minimum duty

Amazon owes to Plaintiffs with respect to worker health and safety at

JFK8 in the face of COVID-19.

       Accordingly, a live controversy remains.              In particular,

rescission of the New York Forward guidance did not resolve




       1   As of June 15, 2021, New York lifted most COVID-19 restrictions,
including most New York Forward guidance. New York State, New York Forward,
Archived Industry Guidance, https://forward.ny.gov/archived-industry-guidance
(last visited October 14, 2022) (explaining how the “archived New York Forward
industry reopening guidance documents are no longer mandatory”).




                                     22
whether Amazon “provide[s] reasonable and adequate protection to

the lives, health and safety” of its employees in conformity with

NYLL § 200, 2 App’x at 120, nor did it resolve whether Amazon has

created a public nuisance. Even if Plaintiffs now lack their preferred

guidepost to establish Amazon’s minimum duty to its employees,

“[a]s long as [Plaintiffs] have a concrete interest in the outcome of the

litigation, the case is not moot.” Firefighter’s Local 1784 v. Stotts, 

467U.S. 561, 568 (1984); see New Eng. Health Care Emps. Union, Dist. 1199

v. Mount Sinai Hosp., 65 F.3d 1024, 1029 (2d Cir. 1995) (“[S]o long as




       2 Amazon also points to a May 10, 2022, decision of the First Department
of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court to argue that Plaintiffs’
NYLL § 200 claim should be dismissed as moot. See Appellees’ Rule 28(j) Ltr. (May
12, 2022). There, the First Department concluded that the New York Attorney
General’s NYLL § 200 claim “seeking a permanent injunction requiring Amazon
to undertake policies consistent with COVID-19 workplace guidelines issued by
the State must be dismissed as moot, as the State has withdrawn the public health
guidance that the claim seeks to enforce, including by prospective injunctive
relief.” New York v. Amazon.com, 205 A.D.3d 485, 487 (1st Dep’t 2022). That
decision does not alter our conclusion here. At bottom, the New York Attorney
General in the New York case specifically sought to enforce guidance that is no
longer in place. In comparison, as we explain above, Plaintiffs do not seek to
enforce the now-withdrawn New York guidance. Rather, Plaintiffs rely upon New
York guidance as one of several guideposts to argue that Amazon is breaching the
duty of care it owes to JFK8 workers under NYLL § 200.




                                       23
the appellant retains some interest in the case, so that a decision in its

favor will inure to its benefit, its appeal is not moot.”). Having

considered the remainder of Amazon’s justiciability arguments, we

find them meritless and turn to the substance of Plaintiffs’ appeal.

      B.     The district court incorrectly applied the primary
             jurisdiction doctrine in dismissing Plaintiffs’ state law
             claims in deference to OSHA

      The     federal    courts    have     a   “virtually     unflagging

obligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction given them.”       Tassy v.

Brunswick Hosp. Ctr., Inc., 296 F.3d 65, 73 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Colo.

River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976)).

Here, we must address a “relatively narrow” exception to this

obligation: the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Goya Foods, Inc. v.

Tropicana Prods., Inc., 846 F.2d 848, 851 (2d Cir. 1988). The doctrine is

a prudential one, Schiller v. Tower Semiconductor Ltd., 449 F.3d 286,

294–95 (2d Cir. 2006), fashioned by the courts, TCG N.Y., Inc. v. City of

White Plains, 305 F.3d 67, 74 (2d Cir. 2002), concerned primarily with

“promoting relationships between the courts and [the] administrative



                                    24
agencies charged with particular regulatory duties,” Ellis, 

443 F.3d at81 (quoting United States v. W. Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63 (1956)),

and with ensuring the two “do not work at cross-purposes,” id.
(internal quotation marks omitted).         The doctrine of primary

jurisdiction “applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the

courts, but enforcement of the claim requires, or is materially aided

by, the resolution of threshold issues, usually of a factual nature,

which are placed within the special competence of the administrative

body.” Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians v. Weicker, 39 F.3d 51,

58–59 (2d Cir. 1994).

      For a court to invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine, it must

determine that the agency, not the courts, should have the “initial

decisionmaking responsibility.”      Ellis, 443 F.3d at 81 (emphasis

added) (internal quotation marks omitted). A court’s application of

the primary jurisdiction doctrine thus “does not [necessarily] deprive

the court of jurisdiction.” Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 268–69 (1993).




                                   25
Rather, once a court determines that the doctrine applies, it has

discretion either: (1) to retain jurisdiction or (2) to dismiss the case

without prejudice. Id.
      If the court retains jurisdiction, the case is “held pending the

conclusion of an appropriate administrative proceeding.” Gen. Am.

Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado T. Co., 308 U.S. 422, 433 (1940); see W. Pac.

R.R. Co., 352 U.S. at 64 (“[T]he judicial process is suspended pending

referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.”). In

other words, the case is “stayed so as to give the plaintiff a reasonable

opportunity within which to apply to the [agency] for a ruling.”

Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pa. R.R. Co., 230 U.S. 247, 267 (1913); see also

Reiter, 507 U.S. at 268 n.3 (observing that “‘[r]eferral’ is sometimes

loosely described as a process whereby a court refers an issue to an

agency,” and clarifying that the Supreme Court’s decision in Mitchell

Coal “spelled out the actual procedure contemplated [in] holding that

further action by the district court should be stayed so as to give the




                                    26
plaintiff a reasonable opportunity within which to apply to the

[agency] for a ruling as to the reasonableness of the practice” (internal

quotation marks omitted)).

      A court in its discretion may choose to dismiss the case without

prejudice—but only “if the parties would not be unfairly

disadvantaged.” Reiter, 507 U.S. at 268. To determine whether a party

will be unfairly disadvantaged, a court can look to the relief the party

is seeking.   For example, in Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound

Conference, the Supreme Court distinguished between a plaintiff

seeking injunctive relief and a plaintiff seeking damages. 383 U.S. 213,

222–23 (1966). There, the Supreme Court noted how, unlike a suit for

injunctive relief from continuing conduct—a suit that “could easily be

reinstituted if and when the [agency] determined” the questions at

issue—a “damage[s] action for past conduct cannot be easily

reinstated at a later time” because “[s]uch claims are subject to the

Statute of Limitations.” Id. Our Court applied these principles in




                                   27
Mathirampuzha v. Potter, where we vacated the district court’s

dismissal and remanded with instructions to stay the proceedings

pending a final determination by the administrative agency because

dismissing the case presented “a significant danger of unfair

disadvantage . . . inasmuch as the plaintiff’s claim [was] subject to a

statute of limitations.” 548 F.3d 70, 84–85 (2d Cir. 2008).

      When determining whether to apply the doctrine of primary

jurisdiction, a court must look to “whether the reasons for the

existence of the doctrine are present and whether the purposes it

serves will be aided by its application in the particular litigation.” W.

Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. at 64. These reasons and purposes are two-fold.

Tassy, 296 F.3d at 68. First, the doctrine seeks to foster “uniformity

and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular

agency.” Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 851 (alteration omitted) (quoting

Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 426 U.S. 290, 303–04 (1976)); see Tex. &

Pac. Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 440 (1907)




                                    28
(concluding that “without previous action by the [agency], power

might be exerted by courts and juries generally to determine the

reasonableness of an established rate, [and] it would follow that

unless all courts reached an identical conclusion a uniform standard

of rates in the future would be impossible”). Second, the doctrine

recognizes that, for certain matters, “‘the expert and specialized

knowledge of the agencies’ should be ascertained before judicial

consideration of the legal claim.” Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 851 (quoting

W. Pac. R.R., 352 U.S. at 64); see Great N. Ry. Co. v. Merchs.’ Elevator Co.,

259 U.S. 285, 291 (1922) (invoking primary jurisdiction because “the

inquiry is essentially one of fact and of discretion in technical

matters”).

       With the doctrine’s reasons and purposes in mind, we turn to

whether deferring to OSHA here is appropriate. Although “[n]o fixed

formula exists for applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,” Ellis,

443 F.3d at 82 (quoting W. Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. at 64), and we




                                     29
generally conduct our analysis on a “case-by-case basis,” Gen. Elec.

Co. v. MV Nedlloyd, 817 F.2d 1022, 1026 (2d Cir. 1987), in Ellis v. Tribune

Television Co., our Court highlighted four factors—which we refer to

here as the “Ellis factors”—upon which we focus our analysis:

      (1) whether the question at issue is within the
      conventional experience of judges or whether it involves
      technical or policy considerations within the agency’s
      particular field of expertise; (2) whether the question at
      issue is particularly within the agency’s discretion;
      (3) whether there exists a substantial danger of
      inconsistent rulings; and (4) whether a prior application
      to the agency has been made.

443 F.3d at 82–83. We must also “balance the advantages of applying

the doctrine against the potential costs resulting from complications

and delay in the administrative proceedings.” Id. at 83 (quoting

AT&T Co., 46 F.3d at 223).

          1.     The Ellis Factors

      Upon weighing the Ellis factors, balancing the advantages of

applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction with the potential costs,

and considering the doctrine’s two-fold aim—particularly the




                                     30
importance of the courts staying their hand in favor of an agency’s

knowledge and expertise—we conclude that the district court

incorrectly applied the doctrine to Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and

NYLL § 200 claims.

             a.    The question at issue is within the conventional
                   experience of judges

      Amazon argues that “Plaintiffs have asked the district court to

craft out of whole cloth a series of regulations applicable to JFK8

alone,” which it contends “is not the core competence of courts.”

Amazon Br. at 21. But the issues before us are tort-based claims—

public nuisance and breach of NYLL § 200—that are within the

conventional experience of judges.

      Generally, we decline to apply the doctrine of primary

jurisdiction “when the issue at stake is legal in nature and lies within

the traditional realm of judicial competence.” Goya Foods, 

846 F.2d at851. For instance, in determining whether it was appropriate to apply

the doctrine, we have identified the following as within “the daily fare




                                  31
of federal judges,” Schiller, 449 F.3d at 295: statutory interpretation,

id.; applying “reasonably settled definitions” in a statute to the facts

of a case, F.T.C. v. Verity Int’l, Ltd., 443 F.3d 48, 60 (2d Cir. 2006); issues

of contract interpretation, Fulton Cogeneration Assocs. v. Niagara

Mohawk Power Corp., 84 F.3d 91, 97 (2d Cir. 1996); and issues involving

“the application of common law principles,” Gen. Elec. Co., 817 F.2d

at 1027–28.

       Looking at the questions before us here, courts routinely decide

whether a defendant’s conduct constitutes a public nuisance. See, e.g.,

Benoit v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., 959 F.3d 491, 504–05

(2d Cir. 2020); Connecticut v. Am. Elec. Power Co., 582 F.3d 309, 353 (2d

Cir. 2009), rev’d on other grounds, 564 U.S. 410 (2011); New York v. Shore

Realty Corp., 759 F.2d 1032, 1050–52 (2d Cir. 1985); 532 Madison Ave.

Gourmet Foods v. Finlandia Ctr., 96 N.Y.2d 280, 292 (2001); see also Tull

v. United States, 481 U.S. 412, 423 (1987) (“A public nuisance action

was a classic example of the kind of suit that relied on injunctive relief




                                      32
provided by courts in equity.”). In addressing this issue, we must

answer antecedent questions of whether a defendant is endangering

the health or safety of a considerable number of persons and whether

a plaintiff has alleged that they suffer special injury beyond that

suffered by the community at large. See Benoit, 959 F.3d at 504–05; 532

Madison Ave., 96 N.Y.2d at 292.

       Similarly, Plaintiffs’ § 200 claim presents questions sounding in

state tort law, and routinely addressed by courts: what duty of care

Amazon owes to Plaintiffs and whether Amazon is in breach of its

duty. See, e.g., In re World Trade Ctr. Lower Manhattan Disaster Site

Litig., 758 F.3d 202, 210 (2d Cir. 2014); Caronia v. Philip Morris USA,

Inc., 715 F.3d 417, 428 (2d Cir. 2013); Akins v. Glens Falls City Sch. Dist.,

53 N.Y.2d 325, 331, 333 (1981). As NYLL § 200 is a codification of the

common law duty to provide workers with a safe work environment,

e.g., Lombardi v. Stout, 80 N.Y.2d 290, 294 (N.Y. 1992); Everitt v.

Nozkowski, 285 A.D.2d 442, 443 (2d Dep’t 2001), a federal court here




                                     33
can look to New York’s common law to inform its determination as

to whether Amazon breached the duty of care it owed to Plaintiffs.

And where common law principles are at play, we have determined

that the issues should be addressed in a judicial forum. See, e.g., Gen.

Elec. Co., 817 F.2d at 1027–28 (“[T]he application of common law

principles [is] more competently decided in a judicial forum”

(internal citations omitted)).

      Amazon also takes issue with the relief Plaintiffs seek, arguing

that Plaintiffs ask the district court to regulate through an injunction

and to address “detailed aspects” of operations at JFK8, thereby

making OSHA, not the courts, the forum best positioned to evaluate

Plaintiffs’ claims. Amazon Br. at 23–24. But Amazon’s arguments

about the possible scope of relief do not transform the traditional state

tort law questions before us into issues requiring OSHA’s technical

and policy expertise. Before relief can be fashioned, questions of

injury, duty, and breach must be addressed.           These questions,




                                   34
including whether the relief requested exceeds that warranted by the

injuries alleged, are squarely within a district court’s bailiwick.

             b.     The question at issue is not particularly within
                    the agency’s discretion

      To determine whether a question falls particularly within an

agency’s discretion, a court looks not to whether administrative

proceedings will make any contribution to resolving the question

before it, but whether administrative proceedings are “likely to make

a meaningful contribution” to resolving the question. Ricci v. Chi.

Mercantile Exch., 409 U.S. 289, 306 (1973) (emphasis added) (internal

quotation marks omitted). Thus, under the second Ellis factor we ask

“whether an agency’s review of the facts ‘will be a material aid’ to the

court ultimately charged with applying” the facts to the law. Tassy,

296 F.3d at 73 (emphasis added) (quoting Ricci, 409 U.S. at 305).

OSHA’s review of these facts would not be such an aid.

      Congress created OSHA through the Occupational Safety and

Health Act of 1970 (the “OSH Act”) to “assure . . . safe and healthful




                                   35
working conditions” for workers by setting and enforcing standards

and providing research, education, and training in the field of

occupational safety and health. 29 U.S.C. § 651. It is therefore within

OSHA’s competence to evaluate and create workplace health and

safety standards.    But even assuming this case falls within that

competence, “[i]n the primary jurisdiction context, whether an agency

is statutorily authorized to resolve a particular issue is not itself

determinative of whether to apply the doctrine.” Tassy, 

296 F.3d at73.

      To determine whether an agency’s expertise would materially

aid the court, we often assess whether a given issue is “legal in

nature,” Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 851–52, or “of a factual nature,” Golden

Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians, 39 F.3d at 58–59. For example, we have

concluded that it is particularly within the Bureau of Indian Affairs’

discretion to resolve “factual issues regarding tribal status,” Id. at 60,

and that the Federal Communications Commission’s exclusive




                                   36
authority over licensing materially aids the “highly factual inquiry”

of whether to apply a license waiver. Ellis, 443 F.3d at 83–85. But even

in those instances, categorizing the nature of the issue does not end

our inquiry.

      When a court is asked to resolve a factual issue the subject-

matter of which falls within an agency’s purview, the question is not

whether, in the abstract, it would be helpful for the agency to set

standards of its own. The issue is instead whether the agency’s

expertise would materially assist the court in resolving difficult

factual questions to determine whether specified legal standards have

been violated. For instance, in Tassy v. Brunswick Hospital Center, Inc.,

an agency’s medical expertise was not required to resolve the

pertinent factual issue before the Court: whether the defendant

committed the alleged sexual harassment. 296 F.3d at 70–71. The

issue did not “implicate any medical data or complex records,” and

so, it was not particularly difficult for a court to handle, nor




                                   37
particularly necessary for an agency to resolve. Id. Similarly, in AT&T

Co., determining whether a party qualified for a lower contract tariff

rate depended on answering the “rather simple factual question” of

whether a party had timely paid its bills, a question whose resolution

was “within the district court’s experience” and did not require the

FCC’s “policy expertise, or its specialized knowledge.” 46 F.3d at 223.

      In support of its contention that the public nuisance and NYLL

§ 200 questions before us are particularly within OSHA’s discretion,

Amazon argues that Plaintiffs’ claims “turn on factual issues

requiring both technical and policy expertise.”       Amazon Br. 23

(internal quotation marks omitted). Amazon highlights how, as of

December 2020, OSHA had “conduct[ed] more than 1,430 COVID-

related inspections and issu[ed] citations totaling more than

$3,849,222 to 294 employers.” Id. at 25. But Amazon fails to mention

that OSHA issued most of those COVID-related citations to

employers in the healthcare sector. See Dep’t of Labor Br. at 33, AFT




                                  38
v. OSHA, No. 20-73203 (9th Cir. Dec. 31, 2020) (noting that, of the 294

employers to have received COVID-related citations, 261 were

employers in the healthcare sector). As such, the COVID-related

citations are consistent with OSHA’s other actions during the

pandemic that have prioritized healthcare workers—namely, its

issuance of an emergency temporary standard (“ETS,” discussed at

greater length below) governing the health and safety of healthcare

and healthcare support workers. These healthcare-focused actions,

therefore, do not necessarily suggest that OSHA’s expertise would

materially aid the court in resolving the issues relating to JFK8.

      Indeed, no OSHA action to date, nor any executive order

concerning worker health and safety, confirms that deferring to

OSHA would be appropriate. On January 21, 2021, President Biden

issued a proclamation directing OSHA to issue revised guidance for

employers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to “consider whether

any emergency temporary standards on COVID-19 . . . are necessary.”




                                  39
Proclamation No. 13999, 86 Fed. Reg. 7,211, § 2(b) (Jan. 21, 2021). In

response, OSHA issued the following in January 2021: (1) guidance

clarifying that OSHA’s existing standards that protect workers from

infectious diseases—see, e.g., 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.134 (standard for

respiratory protection), 1910.136 (standard for personal protective

equipment), 1910.141 (standard for sanitation)—remain in place as

protection from contracting and spreading COVID-19, see Dep’t of

Labor, Occupational Safety & Health Admin., Protecting Workers:

Guidance on Mitigating and Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in the

Workplace (posted Jan. 29, 2021) (updated June 10, 2021),

https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework; and (2) an ETS “to

protect healthcare and healthcare support service workers from

occupational exposure to COVID-19,” 86 Fed. Reg. 32,376, 32,376. On

November 5, 2021, OSHA issued another ETS, one aimed at

protecting “unvaccinated employees of large employers (100 or more

employees) from the risk of contracting COVID-19 by strongly




                                 40
encouraging vaccination.” 3 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402, 61,402. The Supreme

Court temporarily stayed the latter ETS on January 13, 2022, see Nat’l

Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 142 S. Ct. 661, 666–67 (2022), and

shortly thereafter, OSHA withdrew it, see 87 Fed. Reg. 3,928.

       Although OSHA has since rescinded the November 2021

vaccination and testing ETS, Amazon argues that “even if the ETS

never takes effect, it still represents an unambiguous assertion of

OSHA’s expertise and jurisdiction over the health-and-safety issues

at issue here.” Amazon 28(j) Ltr. at 2 (Jan. 20, 2022). And that “[e]ven

if the ETS currently lacks preemptive force,” the OSH Act still

preempts Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim. Id. We disagree.

       With the ETS rescinded, there is no risk that, by resolving

Plaintiffs’ claims, a court would be wading into an area already


3OSHA issued the vaccination and testing ETS after President Biden urged the
agency to promulgate an emergency temporary standard requiring “all employers
with 100 or more employees . . . to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or
show a negative test at least once a week.” President Joseph Biden, Remarks on
Fighting      the       COVID-19         Pandemic        (Sept.       9,     2021),

                                        41
occupied by OSHA. And even had OSHA not rescinded the ETS,

there is no reason to think that the agency was poised to

“unambiguous[ly] assert[]” jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, which

concern, among other things, social distancing and sick leave. Indeed,

the rescinded ETS limited itself to vaccination. Accordingly, even if

OSHA were to indicate that it was on the verge of re-entering the fray

on vaccination, that would hardly lead to the conclusion that the

agency was planning to go so far as to regulate sick leave, social

distancing, or any other areas implicated by Plaintiffs’ claims. Under

these circumstances, we conclude that OSHA’s particular expertise

would not materially aid the resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims.

             c.    There is no substantial danger of inconsistent
                   rulings

      Because OSHA has chosen not to promulgate a cross-industry,

COVID-19-specific standard that would govern the facts of this case,

our conclusion that the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply

presents no substantial danger of inconsistent rulings.          “Federal




                                  42
regulation of the workplace [under the OSH Act] was not intended to

be all encompassing.” Gade v. Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 

505 U.S.88, 96 (1992). Instead, “Congress expressly saved two areas from

federal pre-emption”: (1) “Section 4(b)(4) of the OSH Act states that

the Act does not . . . ‘enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner

the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers

and employees under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or

death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment,’”

id. (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 653(b)(4)); and (2) “Section 18(a) provides that

the Act does not ‘prevent any State agency or court from asserting

jurisdiction under State law over any occupational safety or health

issue with respect to which no [federal] standard is in effect.’” Id. at

96–97 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 667(a)).

      There are no federal standards in effect governing the COVID-

19 protocols at JFK8 that Plaintiffs challenge in their amended

complaint. And even where there may be some overlap between




                                   43
agency and court action, overlap alone does not justify invoking the

primary jurisdiction doctrine, see Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 850
(concluding that “the pendency of a [Patent and Trademark Office]

proceeding was not a proper basis to forestall [the plaintiff’s]

lawsuit”), especially where the agency’s organic statute permits a

parallel enforcement scheme, as is the case here with the OSH Act, see,

e.g., Nader, 426 U.S. at 299–302 (concluding that the common law tort

action for fraudulent misrepresentation and the Federal Aviation Act

“are not ‘absolutely inconsistent’ and may coexist”).

      Moreover, even if OSHA’s vaccination and testing ETS were

still in effect, that ETS would not alter this conclusion, as a state

occupational safety or health standard is only preempted to the extent

that it is “inconsistent” and “relate[s] to the issues addressed by [the]

ETS.” 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402, 61,505. As the ETS said, “[s]tate and local

requirements that ban or otherwise limit workplace vaccination, face

covering, or testing clearly ‘relate’ to the occupational safety and




                                   44
health ‘issues’ that OSHA is regulating in this ETS.” 86 Fed. Reg.

61,402, 61,508; see also Gade, 505 U.S. at 99 (“The principal indication

that Congress intended to pre-empt state law is § 18(b)’s statement

that a State ‘shall’ submit a plan if it wishes to ‘assume responsibility’

for ‘development and enforcement . . . of occupational safety and

health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue

with respect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated.’”

(emphasis added)). Plaintiffs’ claims do not relate to those issues.

Accordingly, there is no substantial risk of inconsistent rulings.

             d.     Plaintiffs have not made a prior application to
                    the agency

      Finally, while not determinative, the fact that Plaintiffs have

made no prior application to OSHA weighs against applying the

doctrine of primary jurisdiction. “If prior application to the agency is

present, this factor provides support for the conclusion that the

doctrine of primary jurisdiction is appropriate.” Ellis, 443 F.3d at 89
(emphasis added); see also Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians, 39




                                   45
F.3d at 60 (concluding deferral to the agency was “fully warranted . . .

where the plaintiff has already invoked the BIA’s authority”). Thus,

“if prior application to the agency is absent, this factor may weigh

against referral of the matter to the agency.” Ellis, 443 F.3d at 89
(emphasis added); see also Schiller, 449 F.3d at 295 (noting how,

ordinarily, the fact that “the party challenging the agency action . . .

made no prior application to the agency,” would “weigh against

primary jurisdiction”). The fourth Ellis factor, in other words, seeks

to accomplish one of the doctrine’s central aims: “to ensure that courts

and agencies with concurrent jurisdiction over a matter do not work

at cross-purposes.” Fulton Cogeneration Assocs., 84 F.3d at 97. Here,

there is no pending proceeding before the agency, and there is no

indication that the agency is poised to take up the specific questions

before us, meaning that there is minimal, if any, concern that a court

will resolve Plaintiffs’ claims and fashion a remedy in a way that

would work at a “cross-purpose” with OSHA’s actions.




                                  46
         2.    Balancing the advantages and the costs

      In deciding whether to apply the primary jurisdiction doctrine,

we must also “balance the advantages of applying the doctrine

against the potential costs resulting from complications and delay in

the administrative proceedings.”      Ellis, 443 F.3d at 83 (internal

quotation marks omitted).     We conclude that the potential costs

would outweigh the advantages. Given OSHA’s understandable

prioritization during the COVID-19 pandemic of the healthcare sector

and the issuance of nationwide mandates such as vaccination

requirements for certain private employers, it is not apparent that

OSHA is likely, as a policy matter, to shift gears and prioritize

developing more general workplace COVID-19 safety standards—

much less standards that would provide meaningful guidance with

respect to Amazon’s JFK8 facility. We discern that abstention in favor

of action by OSHA has the potential to delay this litigation, without

any likelihood of countervailing advantages.

      In sum, we conclude that the district court erred in abstaining



                                 47
based on the primary jurisdiction doctrine.

      C.     Plaintiffs do not plausibly plead a special injury to
             support a public nuisance claim against Amazon

      The district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs’ public nuisance

claim because Plaintiffs fail to allege special injury. Under New York

law, “[a] cause of action for public nuisance ‘exists for conduct that

amounts to a substantial interference with the exercise of a common

right,’ such as ‘endangering’ the ‘health[ or] safety . . . of a

considerable number of persons.’” Benoit, 959 F.3d at 504 (quoting

532 Madison Ave., 96 N.Y.2d at 292). A private person has a cause of

action for public nuisance “only if it is shown that the person suffered

special injury beyond that suffered by the community at large.” Id. at

505 (internal quotation marks omitted). “The injury must be different

in ‘kind,’ not simply ‘degree.’” Id. (quoting 532 Madison Ave., 96

N.Y.2d at 293–94). It therefore is not enough that a private person

“has suffered the same kind of harm or interference but to a greater

extent or degree.” Am. Elec. Power Co., 582 F.3d at 367 (quoting




                                  48
Restatement (Second) Torts § 812C, cmt. b).           The Restatement

(Second) of Torts provides helpful insight into the rule that a private

person must suffer a special injury to state a claim for public nuisance.

Comment a to Section 821C states that “it is uniformly agreed that a

private individual has no tort action for the invasion of the purely

public right, unless his damage is to be distinguished from that

sustained by other members of the public.”

      Plaintiffs argue that “Amazon’s maintenance of an unsafe work

environment causes a different kind of harm to Plaintiffs because it is

a direct affront to their health and safety in their homes and

workplaces.” Plaintiffs Br. at 34. Plaintiffs contend that, unlike

members of the public at large, who can protect themselves from the

virus by avoiding public places, they lack the autonomy to avoid the

reach of Amazon’s conduct since they cannot avoid JFK8 or their

homes. According to Plaintiffs, they have “no meaningful choice but

to subject themselves to Amazon’s misconduct.” Id. at 38.




                                   49
      Amazon counters with the argument that “everyone in New

York who goes to work, the grocery store, or anywhere else risks

being ‘directly exposed’ to COVID-19. The physical, emotional, and

financial harms visited on New York by the virus are common to the

entire community, not unique to Plaintiffs.” Amazon Br. at 40. And

with respect to the Non-Employee Plaintiffs, Amazon argues that

they experience the “same kind of risk that all New Yorkers face when

a family member interacts with others in the community, either by

going to work, shopping at a grocery store, or having a service

technician or other person visit their home.” Id. at 41. Although we

do not discount the risks Plaintiffs allege they face nor the harms

Plaintiffs allege they experience, we agree with Amazon that

Plaintiffs’ alleged harms are different in degree, not in kind, and so

do not make out the requisite special injury to state a claim for public

nuisance. 4


      4
          To claim that their harm is different in kind and not merely degree,




                                      50
       Similarly, Plaintiffs’ allegations that they have suffered

financial losses, including lost wages, because they have avoided

work as a result of Amazon’s workplace safety practices, fail to meet

the special injury requirement. Again, because of the pandemic, the

public at large has suffered the same kind of harm—often devastating

financial losses—that Plaintiffs allege. In fact, Plaintiffs agree that

“the New York economy has been hard-hit by the pandemic.” App’x

at 82. Like Plaintiffs, many other residents of New York have forgone

attending work because of a generalized risk of contracting COVID-




Plaintiffs rely on the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Ileto v. Glock, 349 F.3d 1191 (9th
Cir. 2003). Plaintiffs Br. at 37. There, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs
sufficiently alleged that they “suffered an injury, namely trauma resulting from an
assault with a gun and gun shot wounds, different in kind” from the injuries
experienced by the general public. Ileto, 349 F.3d at 1212 (internal quotation marks
omitted).
        Plaintiffs’ reliance on Ileto is misplaced. As shooting victims, the Ileto
plaintiffs alleged harms (gunshot wounds and trauma) different in kind from the
generalized fear and anxiety the plaintiffs alleged that the public experienced
following the shooting. Id. at 1211–12. Without expressing any view on the
correctness of the Ninth Circuit’s decision, we conclude that Plaintiffs here have
not alleged any analogous harm. Regardless of whether a person works at JFK8,
is a member of a JFK8 employee’s household, or is a member of the public at large,
the alleged harm remains the same: an interference with one’s health and safety—
whether through contracting the virus or through fear of contracting the virus.




                                          51
19. And as New York courts have made clear, when “pecuniary

damages are ‘so general and widespread as to affect a whole

community, or a very wide area within it,’” that injury is the same in

kind. 532 Madison Ave., 96 N.Y.2d at 293.

       Plaintiffs compare their situation to that of the plaintiff-

homeowners in Fresh Air for the Eastside, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt. of New

York, 405 F. Supp. 3d 408 (W.D.N.Y. 2019), who owned property near

a noxious landfill. See Plaintiffs Br. 34. Plaintiffs effectively assert that

their inability to avoid their workplaces and their homes is akin to the

Fresh Air plaintiffs’ “inability to fully utilize their homes” and the

diminution in value of their homes resulting from living adjacent to a

noxious landfill. 405 F. Supp. 3d at 442. But in the case of the noxious

landfill, the plaintiffs’ special injury arose from the landfill’s

interference with their property rights, not from a lack of autonomy

over leaving their homes. Id. Here, the public at large shares in the

risk of contracting COVID-19, regardless of property ownership and




                                     52
employment. As the district court correctly concluded, the general

public cannot avoid the risk of exposure to COVID-19 “simply by

avoiding JFK8, its immediate surrounding area, and its employees.”

App’x at 140.

      To be sure, in Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co, Inc., our

Court suggested that “[d]ifference in degree . . . as a measure of a

different kind of harm, is not entirely out of the picture.” 

582 F.3d at368. This statement relied on comment c to § 821C of the Restatement

(Second) of Torts, which provides that “[d]ifference in degree of

interference cannot . . . be entirely disregarded in determining

whether there has been difference in kind.” The comment provides

an example:

      Normally there may be no difference in the kind of
      interference with one who travels a road once a week and
      one who travels it every day. But if the plaintiff traverses
      the road a dozen times a day he nearly always has some
      special reason to do so, and that reason will almost
      invariably be based upon some special interest of his
      own, not common to the community. Significant
      interference with that interest may be particular damage,




                                  53
      sufficient to support the action in tort. . . . Thus in
      determining whether there is a difference in the kind of
      harm, the degree of interference may be a factor of
      importance that must be considered.

But in American Electric Power Co. we did not need to “demarcate the

outer limits of § 821C(1)’s requirement that the harms be different in

kind (sometimes called ‘special injury’), because the harms asserted

by the [plaintiffs] qualif[ied]” as a special injury (i.e., a harm that was

different in kind). 582 F.3d at 368. We thus did not go so far as to hold

that the degree of a plaintiff’s harm plays a part in determining

whether that harm is different in kind.         And because Plaintiffs’

asserted injury from COVID-19 exposure is not so markedly greater

in degree than that faced by large numbers of the public, we likewise

decline to reach that question today.

      D.     The New York Workers’ Compensation Law does not
             bar claims for injunctive relief under NYLL § 200

      Amazon argues that the New York Workers’ Compensation

Law (“NYWCL”) precludes Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief

under New York Labor Law (“NYLL”) § 200. We disagree.



                                    54
      The New York Court of Appeals has not yet had the

opportunity to decide this question of New York law, so our task is to

predict how it would rule. See In re Brooklyn Navy Yard Asbestos Litig.,

971 F.2d 831, 850 (2d Cir. 1992). And where the highest court of the

state has not spoken, “the best indicators of how it would decide are

often the decisions of lower state courts.” Id. Here, the text, history,

and underlying purposes of the NYWCL, coupled with relevant

precedent from New York’s intermediate courts, enable us to predict

what the New York Court of Appeals would hold: the NYWCL’s

exclusivity provision does not bar claims for injunctive relief under

NYLL § 200.

      Construing New York law, “[o]ur analysis begins with the

language of the statute.” People v. Francis, 30 N.Y.3d 737, 745 (2018).

In addition to statutory language itself, the specific context in which

statutory language is used and the broader context of the statute as a

whole assist the court in ascertaining the text’s plain meaning. See




                                  55
Scott v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 86 N.Y.2d 429, 435 (1995); see also

Albano v. Kirby, 36 N.Y.2d 526, 530 (1975) (“No rule of construction . . .

permits the segregation of a few words from their context and from

all the rest of the section or rule . . . .”). And “[l]iteral meanings of

words are not to be adhered to or suffered to ‘defeat the general

purpose and manifest policy intended to be promoted’” by a given

statute. Council of City of New York v. Giuliani, 93 N.Y.2d 60, 69 (1999)

(quoting People v. Ryan, 274 N.Y. 149, 152 (1937)).

      In this case, we must ascertain the plain meaning of both NYLL

§ 200 and NYWCL § 11. NYLL § 200 outlines the general duty of

employers to safeguard their employees’ well-being by providing

“reasonable and adequate protection to [their] lives, health and

safety” in the workplace. As NYLL § 200 is “a codification of the

common-law duty to provide workers with a safe work

environment,” it essentially codifies a claim for common law

negligence. Everitt, 285 A.D.2d at 443; In re World Trade Ctr. Lower




                                   56
Manhattan Disaster Site Litig., 758 F.3d at 210 (“Codifying common law

negligence, New York Labor Law § 200 provides for a general duty to

protect the health and safety of employees.”).

       The NYWCL focuses on monetary compensation for workers’

injuries. Section 10 requires that an employer “secure compensation

to his employees and pay or provide compensation for their disability

or death from injury arising out of and in the course of the

employment.” And section 11 clarifies that this liability “shall be

exclusive and in place of any other liability whatsoever, to such

employee . . . entitled to recover damages, contribution or indemnity,

at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury or death or

liability arising therefrom . . . .”

       To argue that the NYWCL bars Plaintiffs’ claims, Amazon relies

on the language in NYWCL § 11 providing that the law is exclusive

of “any other liability whatsoever.”        This language, Amazon

contends, illustrates that section 11 protects “employers from suit,”




                                       57
including suits in both law and equity. Amazon Br. at 48 (internal

quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs, on the other hand, interpret the

exclusivity provision to preclude employees from seeking damages,

but not injunctive relief, from employers under NYLL § 200. 5

       The text of NYWCL § 11 supports Plaintiffs’ interpretation.

Namely,      the   language      Amazon       cites—“any       other    liability

whatsoever”—cannot be divorced from the monetary awards listed

later in the same sentence: “damages, contribution, or indemnity.”

N.Y. Workers’ Comp. Law § 11 (McKinney 2017); see Albano, 

36N.Y.2d at 530; see also King v. Time Warner Cable Inc., 894 F.3d 473, 477
(2d Cir. 2018) (“[W]ords to be interpreted are not considered in

isolation.”); City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 524 F.3d 384, 401
(2d Cir. 2008) (“[W]here specific words follow a general word, the



5 As a threshold matter, we do not find it necessary to separate Plaintiffs’
arguments under NYLL § 200 into distinct backward- and forward-looking claims.
Plaintiffs asked the district court to enjoin Amazon from continuing with its
alleged breach of duty under NYLL § 200. That Plaintiffs cite both past and
ongoing conduct to support their need for injunctive relief does not require us to
split their single claim in two.




                                       58
specific words restrict application of the general term to things that

are similar to those enumerated.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

That list of monetary awards confirms that the “liability” referenced

in the NYWCL’s exclusivity provision is confined to claims for

retrospective damages and does not encompass claims for injunctive

relief.

          The NYWCL’s legislative history and New York appellate court

cases further demonstrate that the NYWCL seeks to balance the

monetary interests of employers and employees, while the NYLL

focuses more on regulating employers’ conduct. See, e.g., Acevedo v.

Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc., 189 A.D.2d 497, 502–03 (1st

Dep’t 1993) (“The courts of this state have long held that, if an injury

or disease is covered in any way by Workers’ Compensation, recovery

at law for a particular type of damage resulting from that injury or

disease, even though not compensable, will also be barred.”

(emphasis added)); Huston v. Hayden Bldg. Maintenance Corp., 205




                                   
59A.D.2d 68, 71 (2d Dep’t 1994) (“In our view the primary purpose of

the [NYLL] is to regulate conduct.”).

      The NYWCL was adopted pursuant to a 1913 amendment to

New York’s constitution, which provided that the legislature could

“fix the right to compensation to be paid by an employer for death

resulting to an employee for injuries received in the course of his

employment,” and that “the right of such compensation, and the

remedy therefor shall be exclusive of all other rights and remedies.”

Shanahan v. Monarch Eng’g Co., 219 N.Y. 469, 475–76 (1916) (quoting

1913 constitutional amendment). When promulgating the NYWCL,

the New York legislature thereby created a scheme in which both

employer and employee “gained benefits and made concessions.” 

Id.at 478.

      As part of this tradeoff, the employee receives “the security of

knowing that fixed benefits will be paid,” but forgoes the possibility

of “a more substantial recovery through a jury award.” Dumervil v.




                                 60
Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 163 A.D.3d 628, 629 (2d Dep’t 2018). The

employer is on the hook for “no-fault liability,” but is protected from

the “large damage verdicts which the statute was intended to

foreclose.” Reich v. Manhattan Boiler & Equip. Corp., 91 N.Y.2d 772, 780
(1998); see also Shanahan, 219 N.Y. at 477 (noting that part of the

tradeoff between employers and employees includes an employer not

needing to defend against “unjust or excessive claims”).

       In other words, the legislature was concerned primarily with

the predictability of monetary compensation when adopting the

NYWCL.       See Werner v. State, 53 N.Y.2d 346, 353 (1981) (“[T]he

obvious purpose of those provisions [is] to foreclose the possibility of

duplicative recoveries.”). 6 Had the legislature intended to extend the

NYWCL’s exclusivity provision to injunctive relief as well, it could




       6 Here, there is no risk of duplicative recoveries because the Workmen’s
Compensation Board cannot issue the remedy Plaintiffs seek—an injunction
compelling Amazon to cease the conduct alleged as jeopardizing the health and
safety of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. See N.Y. Workers’ Comp.
Law § 142 (outlining the Board’s “[g]eneral powers and duties”).




                                      61
have so provided, and so altered the tradeoff for both employers and

employees. In the absence of such a statement from the legislature,

however, we decline to extend the exclusivity provision’s reach.

      E.    COVID-19 leave payments are not “wages” under
            NYLL § 191

      Lastly, Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for a violation of NYLL

§ 191 because, as the district court correctly concluded, COVID-19

leave payments are not “wages” as defined by § 191.

      NYLL § 191 outlines the frequency with which an employer

shall pay an employee “wages.” Wages are defined as “the earnings

of an employee for labor or services rendered, regardless of whether

the amount of earnings is determined on a time, piece, commission or

other basis.” N.Y. Lab. Law § 190(1) (McKinney 2008). For purposes

of NYLL § 191, the term “wages” does not include “benefits or wage

supplements.”     Id.    Benefits or wage supplements include

“reimbursement for expenses; health, welfare, and retirement

benefits; and vacation, separation or holiday pay.” Id. § 198-c(2),




                                 62
preempted on other grounds by 75 A.D.3d 755 (3d Dep’t 2010). And New

York’s Leave Law “provid[es] requirements for sick leave and the

provision of certain employee benefits when such employee is subject

to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation due

to COVID-19.” 2020 N.Y. Sess. Laws ch. 25, § 1.1.(a) (McKinney).

      Plaintiffs argue that excepting COVID-19 sick leave from NYLL

§ 191’s “frequency-of-pay provisions” for wages would undermine

the Leave Law’s purpose because the “[p]romise of wages at some

unspecified future date is unlikely to convince a potentially infected

worker to self-isolate if that worker is subsisting week-to-week.”

Plaintiffs Br. at 52. But the New York legislature, well aware that

NYLL § 191 explicitly excludes benefits or wage supplements from its

provisions, described the purpose of the Leave Law as “providing

requirements for sick leave and the provision of certain employee

benefits.” 2020 N.Y. Laws 8091.

      Moreover, COVID-19 sick leave need not be subject to NYLL




                                  63
§ 191’s pay frequency requirements to serve as an “effective tool[] at

protecting public health.” Plaintiffs Br. at 51. Plaintiffs still have a

form of redress available under the Leave Law: they can file a

complaint with the New York Department of Labor (the “NYDOL”).

N.Y.     State,    Dep’t     of    Labor,     COVID-19       Complaint,

https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Department-of-Labor-COVID-19-Complaint

(last visited October 14, 2022).

       Plaintiffs next assert that COVID-19 sick leave payments are

“wages” for purposes of NYLL § 191 because the pay is a statutory

entitlement rather than an “ancillary benefit or wage supplement”

created by employment contract. Plaintiffs Br. at 54. As we explained

in Myers v. Hertz Corp., however, “plaintiffs may not use Labor Law

§ 191 to seek unpaid wages to which they claim to be entitled under a

statute; rather § 191 guarantees only that the wages the employer and

employee have ‘agreed’ upon be paid in a ‘timely’ manner again

according to the ‘terms of [the employee’s] employment.” 





624 F.3d64537, 545 n.1 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting N.Y. Lab. Law § 191).

      We also reject Plaintiffs’ contention that the district court

improperly ignored the NYDOL’s Frequently Asked Questions (the

“FAQ”) concerning COVID-19 sick leave. In pertinent part, the FAQ

explains that “[t]he paid COVID-19 sick leave payments are subject to

the frequency of pay requirements of Section 191.” N.Y. State, New

York Paid Family Leave COVID-19: Frequently Asked Questions

[hereinafter        Paid          Family         Leave          FAQs],

https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/new-york-paid-family-leave-covid-

19-faqs (last visited October 14, 2022). Plaintiffs apparently take this

to mean that COVID-19 sick leave payments are wages for purposes

of NYLL § 191. But as the State of New York explained in its amicus

brief, that FAQ is not guidance regarding NYLL § 191, but more a

“shorthand to explain that the new quarantine leave payments should

be made on the same schedule and in the same manner as wages

subject to Labor Law § 191.” State of New York, Amicus Curiae Br. at




                                  65
24.

      Even if the NYDOL’s FAQ page were a more formal,

authoritative agency pronouncement entitled to deference, it more

strongly suggests that COVID-19 leave payments are benefits, not

wages.   The FAQ does not state that Leave Law payments are

“wages” as defined by § 191. Nor does the FAQ advise that an

employer violates § 191 if it fails to make Leave Law payments per

§ 191’s schedule. Rather, the FAQ suggests that COVID-19 leave

payments are benefits. In the very same FAQ upon which Plaintiffs

rely, the NYDOL titles a section “Benefits” and repeatedly uses the

word thereafter to explain what pay an individual is entitled to under

the Leave Law when subject to an order of quarantine or isolation.

See, e.g., Paid Family Leave FAQs (“How does this affect NY’s COVID-

19 quarantine leave benefits? . . . NY’s COVID-19 quarantine leave

benefits are only available during the order of quarantine or isolation.

. . . This new law provides benefits in cases where an individual is




                                  66
under     an     order    of    quarantine   –   either   mandatory    or

precautionary. . . .” (emphasis added)).

        Furthermore, in describing COVID-19 workplace regulations,

the NYDOL states the following:

        Former Governor Cuomo enacted a law that provides
        benefits – including sick leave, paid family leave, and
        disability benefits – to New York employees impacted by
        the mandatory or precautionary orders of quarantine or
        isolation due to COVID-19. These benefits do not have
        an expiration date. If your employer does not comply
        with this law, you have the right to file a complaint.

N.Y.    State,    Dep’t    of   Labor,    COVID-19    Paid   Sick   Leave,

https://dol.ny.gov (last visited October 14, 2022).

        An agency’s interpretation of a statute “is entitled to great

deference, particularly when that interpretation has been followed

consistently over a long period of time.” United States v. Clark, 

454U.S. 555, 565 (1982). As the district court explained, the NYDOL has

consistently instructed that paid sick leave is a “benefit[]” and that

there is “‘no “correct” or prescribed method’ of provision or

payment.” App’x at 149–50.



                                     67
       Finally, Plaintiffs do not perform any labor at JFK8 while under

mandatory or precautionary COVID-19 quarantine or isolation.

Therefore, the payments Plaintiffs are entitled to receive under the

Leave Law cannot be “wages” under NYLL § 191. See N.Y. Lab. Law

§ 190(1) (defining “wages” as “earnings for labor or services

rendered”). And because payments provided for under the Leave

Law are not “wages” for purposes of NYLL § 191, Plaintiffs do not

have a claim under NYLL § 191 for Amazon’s alleged violations of the

Leave Law.

III.   CONCLUSION

       In sum, we hold as follows:

       (1)   Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are not

             moot.

       (2)   The doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply to

             Plaintiffs’ public nuisance or NYLL § 200 claims.




                                  68
      (3)   Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for public nuisance under

            New York law because they do not allege a special injury.

      (4)   Section 11 of the New York Workers’ Compensation Law

            does not preclude injunctive relief under NYLL § 200.

      (5)   Leave Law payments are not “wages” for purposes of

            NYLL § 191.

      We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’

public nuisance claim and NYLL § 191 claims for damages and

injunctive relief; and we VACATE the district court’s dismissal of

Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim seeking a declaratory judgment and

injunctive relief and REMAND to the district court for further

proceedings on that claim.

DENNY CHIN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:

             I agree with the majority's holdings that (1) Plaintiffs' public

nuisance and New York Labor Law (""NYLL"") § 200 claims are not moot, (2) the

primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply to those claims, (3) § 11 of the New

York Workers' Compensation Law does not preclude injunctive relief under

NYLL § 200, and (4) COVID-19 sick leave payments are not ""wages"" under NYLL

§ 191. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's conclusion that the

district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs' public nuisance claim. I would find

that the harm Plaintiffs faced was different in kind -- not just degree -- from that

faced by the community at large. Accordingly, I would conclude that Plaintiffs

adequately pleaded special injury to support their public nuisance claim.

             Under New York law, ""[a] cause of action for public nuisance 'exists

for conduct that amounts to a substantial interference with the exercise of a

common right,' such as 'endangering' the 'health or safety of a considerable

number of persons.'"" Benoit v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., 

959 F.3d491, 504 (2d Cir. 2020) (alterations omitted) (quoting 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet

Foods, Inc. v. Finlandia Ctr., Inc., 96 N.Y.2d 280, 292 (2001)). ""A 'public nuisance is

actionable by a private person only if it is shown that the person suffered special
injury beyond that suffered by the community at large.'"" Id. at 505 (quoting 532

Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc., 96 N.Y.2d at 292). ""The injury must be different

in 'kind,' not simply 'degree.'"" Id. (quoting 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc.,

96 N.Y.2d at 294); see Connecticut v. Am. Elec. Power Co., Inc., 582 F.3d 309, 367 (2d

Cir. 2009) (""It is not enough that he has suffered the same kind of harm or

interference but to a greater extent or degree.""), rev'd on other grounds, 

564 U.S.410 (2011). As the majority acknowledges, however, a “[d]ifference in degree of

interference cannot . . . be entirely disregarded in determining whether there has

been difference in kind.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821C, cmt. c.

             The majority observes that because all New Yorkers faced the risk of

contracting COVID-19, any injury suffered by Plaintiffs is one of a difference

only in degree, not in kind. I disagree. Plaintiffs are not alleging that the

generalized risk of contracting COVID-19 constitutes a public nuisance, but

rather that Amazon's conduct created a public nuisance that disproportionately

injured them. First, Plaintiffs faced heightened COVID-19 risks due to the

conditions of their employment. Second, they risked financial losses if they

dared to mitigate those conditions. The harms here -- employment conditions

and financial losses -- are different in kind from those the public faced because



                                          2
the community at large was not subjected to the conditions that the workers at

JFK8 endured. The public at large did not even enter JFK8.

               As alleged in the amended complaint (and assumed to be true for

purposes of this appeal), Plaintiffs faced conditions that significantly increased

their risk of contracting COVID-19 and were forced to face these heightened risks

under threat of discipline or termination. Amazon's demanding productivity

requirements at JFK8, an 840,000 square foot fulfillment center on Staten Island, 1

prevented workers from engaging in social distancing or basic hygiene and

sanitation practices. See, e.g., J. App'x at 108 ¶ 250 (workers ""fear taking the time

to clean their stations for fear it will result in a writeup for [productivity] issues);

id. at 109 ¶ 253 (because of changes to employee break schedules, ""bathroom

lines and break rooms are more crowded during the break time"").

               Moreover, Amazon implemented a contact-tracing plan that was

effectively inoperative, discouraged employees from informing their colleagues

if they had tested positive, and penalized workers who raised concerns about the

lack of COVID-19 safety protocols at the warehouse. See, e.g., J. App'x at 111




1 JFK8 operates 24 hours, seven days a week. On average, there are approximately 3,500 workers at one
time, but during peak seasons around the holidays or Amazon Prime Day in July, this number can
increase to 5,000 workers. See J. App'x at 88 ¶ 86; 127-28.
                                                   3
¶ 280 (Amazon's contact tracing system consisted ""entirely of reviewing

surveillance footage to monitor the workplace contacts of workers diagnosed

with COVID-19""); id. at 113 ¶ 290 (workers who tested positive were discouraged

from telling their coworkers and were given no guidance on how to ""monitor

their health at home, quarantine when not at work, or to seek medical advice"").

Though Amazon suspended the tracking requirements for the ""total time off

task"" (""TOT"") system in March 2020, workers were not informed until July 2020.

See id. at 106 ¶¶ 232-33 (Amazon instructed managers ""not to post the talking

points [about the change in TOT rate enforcement] publicly""). Until then, the

strict TOT system and the risk of termination forced Plaintiffs to continue

working in conditions that rendered them particularly susceptible to COVID-19.

See, e.g., id. at 107 ¶ 238 (the TOT system ""forced [workers] to work at a frenzied

pace""); id. at 108 ¶ 245 (the productivity requirements ""discourage[d] workers

from leaving their workstations to wash their hands and from taking the time to

wipe down their workstations"").

             Plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the threat of discipline or

termination if they failed to meet their productivity requirements kept them

confined to the hazardous environment inside JFK8. Warehouse workers were at



                                          4
particular risk of contracting COVID-19. First, warehouses often contained

thousands of employees working in ""cramped or tight spaces"" at high work rates

and talking at elevated volumes to overcome the din of machinery. Br. of Amici

Curiae Occupational Health Physicians et al. in support of Plaintiff-Appellants

(""Br. of Amici Curiae"") at 3-4. Such conditions increased the risk of transmission

of an airborne virus such as COVID-19 because employees were discouraged

from leaving their workstations to sanitize themselves after each potential

exposure. Id. This heightened risk was exacerbated where, as here, workers

were deprived of preventative safety measures and were unable to easily access

sick leave, resulting in an increased risk of infecting their coworkers and families.

             Plaintiffs lacked the autonomy to avoid the hazardous conditions

arising from Amazon's conduct. And unlike many members of the public,

Plaintiffs were not permitted to work remotely. If anything, because the demand

for packages increased during the pandemic, they had even less flexibility in that

respect. See, e.g., J. App'x at 88 ¶ 87 (Amazon said it hired 175,000 new workers

in April 2020, many of whom were ""temporary workers hired to meet increased

demand during the pandemic"").




                                          5
             At the end of each nearly 11-hour shift working under these

conditions, Plaintiffs would then take the increased risk of infection home to

their families. While Amazon may have created an indirect harm to the public in

the form of community spread, its practices directly endangered Plaintiffs in the

workplace and further endangered the communities with whom Plaintiffs

interacted. See Br. of Amici Curiae at 24. Plaintiffs Chandler and Bernard

contracted COVID-19 while working at JFK8, and Chandler's cousin, with whom

she lived, died during that time from the disease. The physical and emotional

injuries that followed were distinct from those the community faced because

they arose proximately from Amazon's conduct.

             Plaintiffs also suffered economic harm not suffered by members of

the public because they faced loss of pay and sick leave. See, e.g., J. App'x at 92

¶¶ 120-24 (workers felt ""increased pressure to attend work while sick"" because

they feared losing the opportunity to accrue limited unpaid leave time); id. at 89

¶ 98 (Amazon retaliated against workers who spoke out about workplace safety

and COVID-19). New York courts have long recognized that economic harm can

be a sufficient special injury for a private plaintiff to maintain a public nuisance

claim. See 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc., 96 N.Y.2d at 293 (private right of



                                          6
action where public nuisance ""had a devastating effect on [plaintiffs'] ability to

earn a living""). Further, ""[o]n the matter of special damage . . . there is no

requirement that there be directness of such damage, or that there be any

particular quantum, before there is a right to a private remedy, such as

injunction."" Graceland Corp. v. Consol. Laundries Corp., 180 N.Y.S.2d 644, 648
(1958), aff'd, 6 N.Y.2d 900 (1959). Defendants made it difficult for workers who

tested positive for COVID-19 to obtain sick leave and allegedly did not pay the

full amount of COVID-19 sick pay.

             Constrained by the demanding requirements of the TOT system,

Plaintiffs were faced with an unenviable choice: continue working in a

dangerous and demanding work environment or avoid it to protect their health

but face a high likelihood of losing their jobs. Although it is true, as the majority

observes, that many New Yorkers suffered financial losses as a result of the

pandemic, the losses Plaintiffs allege are different in kind because they resulted

from Amazon's affirmative decisions not to implement any sufficient measures

to mitigate the high risk of COVID-19 transmission inherent in warehouse work.

See, e.g., Br. of Amici Curiae at 7 (due to ""certain environmental design

characteristics that make social distancing difficult [in warehouses], . . . it [is] all



                                            7
the more important that employers implement all mitigation measures to

prevent COVID-19 infection."").

            Plaintiffs have thus plausibly pleaded special injury that they faced a

heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19 and threat of economic harm because

of conditions at JFK8. Thus, I would hold that the lower court erred in

dismissing Plaintiffs' public nuisance claim.

                                Case No. CV-22-967669


                                            Appearances:

                 Nick Iannetta, pro se.

                 Steptoe & Johnson PLLC and Dallas F. Kratzer III, for
                 appellee.


MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J.:

                   Plaintiff-appellant Nick Iannetta (“Iannetta”), pro se, appeals the trial

court’s order granting defendant-appellee Amazon Inc.’s (“Amazon”) motion to

dismiss. For the following reasons, we affirm.
Factual and Procedural History

               Iannetta’s lawsuit stems from his sale of paperback and eBooks

through Authorhouse, a third-party publishing company, who listed and sold the

books on Amazon. Iannetta disputes whether his Authorhouse account accurately

reflects the number of books sold on Amazon. Specifically, Iannetta argues that

Amazon’s website shows it has more books available for sale than the number of

books sold to Amazon through Authorhouse. Iannetta also argues that Amazon lists

him as an Amazon bestseller, which denotes sales of at least 3,000 books, but

Iannetta’s Authorhouse account reflects the sale of fewer books. The record does

not demonstrate whether Iannetta executed contracts with Authorhouse or Amazon.

               In or around May 2018, Iannetta initiated arbitration proceedings in

Ohio against Authorhouse. Pursuant to those proceedings, a subpoena was issued,

at Iannetta’s request, to Amazon in Washington state seeking (1) a record, printout,

or report stating the number of copies Amazon sold of Iannetta’s book titled “2015

Top Pro Football Prospects Scouting Reports” and (2) a statement, printout, or

report that reflected the number of new and used copies of the book that Amazon

had for sale. On June 22, 2018, Amazon filed objections to the subpoena and

Iannetta allegedly did not respond to those objections.1 Amazon did not provide the

information requested in the subpoena. Iannetta claims that without the requested

information from Amazon he was forced to “waive” the arbitration proceedings.



      1 The record does not include any documents from Iannetta’s 2018 action other than

a copy of Amazon’s objections to the subpoena.
              Approximately four years later, on August 19, 2022, Iannetta filed a

complaint in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-22-967669 against Amazon titled “pre-suit

complaint for discovery.” The complaint reads verbatim:

      Amazon denied the arbitration subpoena in Cleveland Municipal Court
      to obtain sales results for the paperback book and e-book from the first
      day the book went on sale on amazon, and I was not able to complete
      the arbitration with Authorhouse and the arbitration was waived. If
      Amazon intentionally did not notify Authorhouse of all the books sold
      on amazon or hid book sales from Authorhouse which would have
      prevented Authorhouse from paying me my royalties, I would expect to
      be paid compensatory damages, attorney fees, court costs, and punitive
      damages from amazon. Therefore, I was not able to receive money
      from amazon through Authorhouse for the books sold on Amazon. I
      am also entitled to any other monetary relief at law and in equity from
      Amazon.

      Objective: Is to obtain sales results from amazon for the paperback
      book and e-book from the first day the book went on sale on amazon.

      The number of used and new paperback books that were up for sale
      on amazon is more than the number of paperback books recorded sold
      in the author house account. Amazon indicated that I sold e-books,
      and this is significant because not one amazon electronic book is
      recorded sold in my Authorhouse account. Both the e-book version
      and paperback version are listed as amazon bestsellers on amazon.
      For the paperback and e-book versions, the minimum number of
      books sold by an author to qualify as an amazon bestseller is 3,000
      books. I expect the number of books sold on amazon to be higher than
      that since the paperback and e-book versions sales ranks are ranked
      much higher than that.

      At the time, the paperback sold for $35 and the e-book sold for $20. I
      never saw any amazon account statement. It sure seems like more
      books are sold on amazon than the number of books Authorhouse
      reported sold on amazon.

      I am requesting a one page transaction summary of all books sold on
      amazon from the first day the book went on sale on Amazon. I was
      not able to obtain the appropriate sales information from
      Authorhouse.
      What facts do you know about the case?

      How many paperback books did Amazon sell from the first day the
      book went on sale on Amazon?
      ISBN-10: 1524602639 and 13: 9781524602635

      How many e-books did Amazon sell from the first day the book went
      on sale on Amazon? Former ASIN Number: B01EFU8HVY (Now has a
      new ASIN number)

Complaint, August 19, 2022. Attached to the complaint are printouts from various

book sellers’ websites that advertise Iannetta’s book for sale and a royalty report

from an unknown source that reflects the sale of six copies of Iannetta’s book.

              The complaint was served on Amazon in January 2023. On February

2, 2023, Amazon filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Civ.R.

12(B)(6). The motion to dismiss was unopposed, and the trial court summarily

granted the motion on February 22, 2023.

              On March 24, 2023, Iannetta filed a timely appeal, presenting this

assignment of error for our review: “The trial court did [err] granting Amazon’s

motion to dismiss.”

Legal Analysis

              Iannetta argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed his

discovery lawsuit filed pursuant to R.C. 2317.48 seeking the exact number of his

books that Amazon had sold. Amazon disputes that Iannetta filed a discovery

complaint merely seeking discovery. Amazon argues that the trial court properly

dismissed Iannetta’s complaint because (1) Ohio does not recognize an independent
cause of action to enforce or seek damages relating to a subpoena and, (2)

alternatively, assuming an independent cause of action to seek damages stemming

from a subpoena was available, the action must fail because the subpoena in

question was invalid and unenforceable.        We find that regardless of whether

Iannetta’s complaint was meant to initiate a lawsuit or obtain discovery under R.C.

2317.48, the trial court did not err when it granted Amazon’s motion to dismiss.

               A Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on

which relief can be granted “is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint.”

State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs., 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605

N.E.2d 378 (1992), citing Assn. for Defense of Washington Local School Dist. v.

Kiger, 42 Ohio St.3d 116, 117, 537 N.E.2d 1292 (1989). We review a dismissal

pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) de novo. Perrysburg Twp. v. Rossford, 

103 Ohio St.3d79, 2004-Ohio-4362, 814 N.E.2d 44, ¶ 5.

               In our review of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, we must accept

the material allegations of the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences

in favor of the plaintiff. Jenkins v. Cleveland, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104768, 2017-

Ohio-1054, ¶ 8, citing Johnson v. Microsoft Corp., 106 Ohio St.3d 278, 2005-Ohio-

4985, 834 N.E.2d 791, ¶ 6. For a party to ultimately prevail on the motion, it must

appear from the face of the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that

would justify a trial court granting relief. Jenkins at id., citing O’Brien v. Univ.

Community Tenants Union, Inc., 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 245, 327 N.E.2d 753 (1975).
               The basis of Iannetta’s complaint is not readily discernible. Initially,

we review the complaint under the most likely premise that Iannetta filed a

discovery complaint in accordance with R.C. 2317.48. Although the pleading does

not reference the statute, it is titled “pre-suit complaint for discovery” and seeks the

answers to three interrogatory questions.

               R.C. 2317.48 allows a party to obtain discovery prior to filing a

complaint, and provides:

      When a person claiming to have a cause of action or a defense to an
      action commenced against him, without the discovery of a fact from the
      adverse party, is unable to file his complaint or answer, he may bring
      an action for discovery, setting forth in his complaint in the action for
      discovery the necessity and the grounds for the action, with any
      interrogatories relating to the subject matter of the discovery that are
      necessary to procure the discovery sought. Unless a motion to dismiss
      the action is filed under Civil Rule 12, the complaint shall be fully and
      directly answered under oath by the defendant. Upon the final
      disposition of the action, the costs of the action shall be taxed in the
      manner the court deems equitable.

               “An action for discovery is to be used only to uncover facts necessary

for pleading, not to gather proof to support a claim or to determine whether a cause

of action exists.” Huge v. Ford Motor Co., 155 Ohio App.3d 730, 2004-Ohio-232,

803 N.E.2d 859, ¶ 10 (8th Dist.), citing Marsalis v. Wilson, 149 Ohio App.3d 637,

2002-Ohio-5534, 778 N.E.2d 612 (2d Dist.). “This form of action occupies a small

niche between an unacceptable ‘fishing expedition’ and a short and plain statement

of a complaint or a defense filed pursuant to the Civil Rules.” Poulos v. Parker

Sweeper Co., 44 Ohio St.3d 124, 127, 541 N.E.2d 1031 (1989). In other words, R.C.

2317.48 provides “a ‘satisfactory middle course’ for litigants who require additional
facts in order to sufficiently file a valid complaint, but who already have enough

factual basis for their assertions that the discovery process would not be turned into

a ‘fishing expedition.’” Fasteners for Retail v. Peck, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 70818,

1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 1334, 3 (Apr. 3, 1997), citing Poulos at 126. “Broad assertions

of potential claims will not suffice; instead, ‘[i]t must be clear to the court what the

underlying claim is about.’” TILR Corp. v. TalentNow, LLC, 1st Dist. Hamilton No.

C-220323, 2023-Ohio-1345, ¶ 19, quoting Colegate v. Lohbeck, 

78 Ohio App.3d 727,730, 605 N.E.2d 1301 (1st Dist.1992).

                Here, Iannetta’s discovery complaint asked what facts Amazon knew

about the case and how many of Iannetta’s books Amazon sold since it first listed his

book for sale. Iannetta sought information to determine if he had a cause of action

against Amazon rather than requesting information to clarify a specific fact.

Iannetta sought information that is exactly what Poulos described as a fishing

expedition and is not permitted under R.C. 2317.48. Thus, Iannetta did not raise a

justiciable cause of action against Amazon and discovery was not permissible per

R.C. 2317.48.

                Alternatively, assuming Iannetta filed a complaint to initiate a lawsuit

as argued by Amazon, the pleading failed to state a claim upon which relief could be

granted. A plain reading of the complaint indicates Iannetta alleged if Amazon failed

to notify Authorhouse of the actual number of Iannetta’s books it had sold on its

website, Amazon owed Iannetta compensatory and punitive damages, attorney fees,
and court costs. It is unclear whether Iannetta’s allegations are based upon a

contract dispute or a deficiency related to the subpoena.

               To state a claim for breach-of-contract, the plaintiff must allege (1)

the existence of a binding contract, (2) the nonbreaching party performed his or her

contractual obligations, (3) the other party failed to fulfill its contractual obligations

without legal excuse, and (4) the nonbreaching party suffered damages as a result of

the breach. Cynergies Consulting, Inc. v. Wheeler, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90225,

2008-Ohio-3362, ¶ 15, citing All Star Land Title Agency, Inc. v. Surewin Invest.,

Inc., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87569, 2006-Ohio-5729. Iannetta failed to reference

or attach a contract — either with Authorhouse or Amazon — in support of his

allegations and did not state that he performed any contractual obligations. Absent

such allegations, Iannetta’s complaint failed to state a claim for breach of contract

upon which relief could be granted. Further, if the complaint sought compliance

with Iannetta’s previously issued subpoena — as argued by Amazon — Iannetta did

not identify such a cause of action or reference a relevant statute, code section, or

case law in support of such an allegation.

               Accordingly, Iannetta’s complaint did not state a claim upon which

relief could be granted and his assignment of error is overruled.

               Judgment affirmed.

      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.

      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.
      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the

common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.

      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27

of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

[*1]David Solomon, Plaintiff-Appellant,

v

Amazon.com, Inc. et al., Defendants-Respondents, Froebel Chungata, etc., et al., Defendants.



David Solomon, appellant pro se.
The Chartwell Law Offices, LLP, White Plains (Carmen A. Nicolaou of counsel), for respondents.
Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Paul L. Alpert, J.), entered on or about September 15, 2022, which granted the motion of defendants The Chartwell Law Offices LLP, Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market Group Inc., Carmen Nicolaou, individually and as lawyer employed by The Chartwell Law Offices LLP, and Jay Warren, individually (WFM/Chartwell defendants) to dismiss the complaint, unanimously affirmed, without costs.
Order, same court and Justice, entered on or about April 26, 2023, which, insofar as appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied as moot the following nine motions brought by plaintiff: a motion to strike defendants' reply on their motion to dismiss, two motions to find defendants guilty of perjury, a motion to deny defendants' cross-motion for sanctions, a motion to add a case citation to the prior motion to strike, a motion to transfer the case to the Appellate Division, a motion for a default judgment pursuant to CPLR 3126, a motion to compel defendants to admit transfer to the Appellate Division, and a motion to reverse plaintiff's suspension from the practice of law, unanimously affirmed, without costs.
The motion court properly dismissed the complaint as against the WFM/Chartwell defendants. Plaintiff purports to assert a claim under 42 USC §§ 1983 and 1985 for deprivation of his constitutional rights to cross-examine the underlying anonymous complainants in a discrimination proceeding he initiated with the New York State Division of Human Rights and to ""a judgment that is not based entirely on the[ir] hearsay accusations."" This claim must fail because plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that any such rights (to the extent they exist) were violated here, that the WFM/Chartwell defendants acted under color of state law, or the existence of a conspiracy involving these defendants.
Having dismissed the complaint as against the WFM/Chartwell defendants, the motion court properly denied plaintiff's various motions aimed at those defendants as moot.

[*1]The People of the State of New York, etc., Plaintiff-Respondent,

v

Amazon.com., et al., Defendants-Appellants, HR Policy Association, Amicus Curiae, The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, Amicus curiae.



Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, Washington, D.C. (Jason C. Schwartz of the bar of the District of Columbia and State of Maryland, admitted pro hac vice, of counsel), for appellants.
Letitia James, Attorney General, New York (Ester Murdukhayeva of counsel), for respondent.
Fisher & Phillips LLP, New York (Seth Kaufman, G. Roger King and Gregory Hoff of counsel), for HR Policy Association, amicus curiae.
Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, New York (Jennifer L. Bloom and Shawn Patrick Regan of counsel), for The Chambers of Commerce of the United States of America, amicus curiae.
Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Nancy M. Bannon, J.), entered on or about October 18, 2021, which, insofar as appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, unanimously reversed, on the law, and the motion granted. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.
The complaint alleges that defendants (collectively, Amazon) repeatedly and persistently failed to institute reasonable health and safety measures at its facilities (the JFK8 fulfillment center and the DBK1 delivery station) during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect its workers from COVID-19, in violation of Labor Law § 200, and retaliated against workers who raised related complaints about safety conditions, in violation of Labor Law §§ 215 and 740.
Contrary to the motion court, we find that the Labor Law §§ 215 and 740 claims alleging retaliation against workers based, in part, on their participation in protests against unsafe working conditions plainly relate to the workers' participation in ""concerted activities for the purpose of . . . mutual aid or protection,"" i.e., activities that are protected by the NLRA (Hoesten v Best, 34 AD3d 143, 154 [1st Dept 2006]), and therefore that the claims are preempted (see San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, Millmen's Union, Local 2020 v Garmon, 359 US 236, 242-243 [1959]). Where conduct is clearly protected or prohibited by the NLRA, the NLRB, and not the states, should serve as the forum for disputes arising out of the conduct (id.). As no exception to Garmon preemption, including the local interest exception, applies to claims that are clearly covered by the NLRA (see Brown v Hotel & Rest. Empls. & Bartenders Intl. Union Local 54, 468 US 491, 502-503 [1984]), these claims must be dismissed with no further analysis.
Even if the claims were only ""arguably protected"" by the NLRA and therefore application of the local interest exception was not foreclosed (see id.), and even assuming the State made a sufficient showing of a ""'deeply rooted'"" State interest in protecting employees against retaliation for protesting workplace safety conditions under its police powers that might, in some circumstances, be a basis for an exception from Garmon preemption (see Brown, 468 US at 502-503), the exception would not properly be applied in this case. There is a proceeding pending before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) involving essentially the same allegations of retaliation, and the possibility of inconsistent rulings on the same issue poses an ""obvious and substantial"" ""risk of interference with the [NLRB's] jurisdiction"" (Local 926, Intl. Union of Operating Engrs., AFL-CIO v Jones, 460 US 669, 682-683 [1983]).
The Labor Law § 200 claim seeking a permanent injunction requiring Amazon to undertake policies consistent with COVID-19 workplace guidelines issued by the State must be dismissed as moot, as the State has withdrawn the public health guidance that the claim seeks to enforce, including [*2]by prospective injunctive relief.

In this interlocutory appeal, the employee contends she injured her right knee and both
ankles when she fell off a motorized scooter while at work. The employer initially
authorized certain medical treatment, but it later declined to approve the authorized treating
physician’s referral to an orthopedic specialist or provide a panel of orthopedic physicians,
repeatedly insisting that the employee must attend an examination with a physician of the
employer’s choice first. The employee refused, and the employer filed a motion to compel
the examination. Following a hearing, the court granted the motion but ordered the
employer to honor the orthopedic referral made by the authorized physician before the
employer’s examination could proceed. The employer has appealed. Upon careful review
of the record and consideration of the pertinent statutory language, we affirm the trial
court’s order and remand the case.
Judge Pele I. Godkin delivered the opinion of the Appeals Board in which Presiding Judge
Timothy W. Conner and Judge Meredith B. Weaver joined.
Kristen C. Stevenson, Knoxville, Tennessee, for the employer-appellant, Amazon.com
David B. Weatherman, Franklin, Tennessee for the employee-appellee, Sabrina Rooks
                             Factual and Procedural History
      On May 29, 2024, Sabrina Rooks (“Employee”) was working for Amazon.com
(“Employer”) when she fell from a knee scooter and reported sustaining several injuries.
Employee was using a scooter due to a non-work-related injury and asserted she “was
walking in the Amazon warehouse when debris caused my knee scooter to slip out from
                                              1
under me. I fell and felt immediate severe pain in [my] foot, ankle, and knee.” 1 Employee
reported the incident to Employer and testified that she was advised to go to the emergency
room because AmCare, Employer’s on-site medical facility, was closed. 2
       Thereafter, Employee was seen at AmCare and provided Employer with paperwork
from her emergency room visit. At that time, Employee was offered a panel of physicians,
although she did not immediately select a provider from the panel because she wanted to
continue treating with Dr. Christopher Jones, the doctor who was treating her non-work-
related injury. Employee also claimed that she did not understand the panel process and
that certain adjusters allegedly told her she could seek treatment with Dr. Jones. When
Employee saw Dr. Jones the following month, however, Employee was informed that he
“couldn’t do anything[] when he found out it was workers’ comp.” Employer, for its part,
argued that Employee refused to be treated by a panel physician for “approximately five
weeks” and that her visit with Dr. Jones in June was unauthorized.
        Employee selected Concentra and Dr. Frank Thomas from an Employer-provided
panel in June. She was first seen by Dr. Thomas on July 3, 2024, who diagnosed a right
distal fracture of the fibula. In medical documentation Employee provided to Employer,
Dr. Thomas marked that Employee’s injury was “work-related.” At that time, Dr. Thomas
also assigned work restrictions and referred Employee to Dr. Jones, the orthopedic surgeon
Employee had already been seeing, for additional treatment. Instead of authorizing this
direct referral or providing a panel of alternative specialists, however, Employer proceeded
to schedule an employer’s examination with Dr. Jeffrey Hazlewood, which Employee
declined to attend. Dr. Thomas made additional referrals to Dr. Jones on August 5, 8, 19,
and 21. Employer did not approve the referrals and eventually suspended Employee’s
benefits due to “medical noncompliance as she would not attend the [employer’s
examination].”
          Employee filed a PBD on August 28, 2024, stating that
          My [authorized treating physician] Dr. Frank Thomas referred me to Ortho
          Dr. Christopher Jones, but Employer will not schedule an appointment with
          him, nor have I been provided a panel of Orthos. I was let go from my job
          on August 22, 2024, and am totally disabled from working, but I have not
          been paid any TTD.

  There is conflicting information in the record as to where Employee’s fall occurred. In her petition for
benefit determination (“PBD”), Employee stated she was “[w]alking out to her car” and that her fall was
caused by debris; however, in her Rule 72 Declaration, Employee stated she was “walking in the Amazon
warehouse” when the incident occurred. In her deposition, Employee testified that she was “walking
through an area” when she fell. The trial court’s order references a fall in the parking lot.
2
    No medical records of an emergency room visit are included in the record.
                                                      2
In her petition, Employee alleged injuries to her right knee, right ankle, and left knee. In
December, in conjunction with her request for an expedited hearing, Employee attached a
Rule 72 declaration and Employer’s “Healthcare Provider Request for Information Form,”
which was signed by Dr. Thomas. In her declaration, Employee stated that no appointment
was scheduled with Dr. Jones despite several referrals. Moreover, on August 15, Employer
asked her to submit to an employer’s examination with Dr. Hazlewood.
       In January 2025, a dispute certification notice (“DCN”) was issued that identified
compensability, medical benefits, and temporary disability benefits as disputed issues.
Employer also raised additional defenses on the DCN, asserting that some or all of
Employee’s claimed injuries are “related to a pre-existing condition and/or subsequent
intervening event and not an accidental injury arising primarily out of employment” and
are “idiopathic and not related to a hazard incident to employment.” On February 12,
Employer notified Employee it had scheduled an appointment with Dr. Hazlewood in
March, but Employee indicated she would not attend that appointment until Employer
authorized an appointment with Dr. Jones. On February 14, Employer filed a motion to
compel Employee’s examination by Dr. Hazlewood. In her response to the motion,
Employee requested that the court order Employer to provide treatment with Dr. Jones as
outlined in her request for an expedited hearing.
       The court addressed the motion to compel at the March 3, 2025 expedited hearing.
The court focused on sworn statements and testimony offered by Employee in support of
her position that Dr. Thomas was selected from an Employer-provided panel and that Dr.
Thomas initiated a direct referral to Dr. Jones. Moreover, the court emphasized that
Employer had offered the adjuster’s “unsworn and unauthenticated emails dated several
weeks later” in support of its argument that Employee had refused panels of physicians, a
position the court ultimately concluded was not supported by the evidence. In finding that
Employer’s refusal to honor the direct referral or otherwise offer a panel of specialists was
unreasonable, the court stressed that the emails Employer offered into evidence were
circulated three weeks after Employee saw Dr. Thomas, the authorized doctor, who made
the direct referral to Dr. Jones. Thereafter, the court noted that Dr. Thomas made four
additional referrals, none of which were honored. 3
       Employer argued that it refused to authorize the direct referral to Dr. Jones because
Employee was medically non-compliant, asserting that Employee initially refused to select
a doctor from a panel. In its order, the court noted that Employee had testified she did not
understand the panel requirement and eventually “changed course on July 3.” It
determined she was compliant from that date forward and, although she initially refused
Employer’s request for an employer examination in July, Employer “did not renew its
request on this record until February – seven months after the specialist referral.” The
court considered the delay “troubling” and pointed to mandatory language in Tennessee
3
 The court determined that Employee’s visits to the emergency room and her visit to Dr. Jones in June
were also authorized because each visit was approved by her adjuster or a representative of Employer.
                                                 3
Code Annotated section 50-6-204(a)(3)(A)(ii), which states that, in circumstances where
an authorized physician refers the employee to a specific physician, “[t]he employer shall
be deemed to have accepted the referral” unless the employer provides a panel of alternate
specialists within three business days.
       Ultimately, the court determined that Employer had offered nothing to justify its
refusal either to schedule an appointment with Dr. Jones or to offer a panel of specialists
despite five separate referrals from Dr. Thomas. The court stressed that an authorized
treating physician’s referral is not conditioned on whether an employee agrees to undergo
an employer’s examination. As a result, the court ordered Employer to honor the referral
and also ordered Employee to attend an employer’s examination “after the statutorily
mandated appointment with Dr. Jones.” 4 Employer has appealed.
                                         Standard of Review
       The standard we apply in reviewing the trial court’s decision presumes that the
court’s factual findings are correct unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.
See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(c)(7) (2024). When the trial judge has had the
opportunity to observe a witness’s demeanor and to hear in-court testimony, we give
considerable deference to factual findings made by the trial court. Madden v. Holland Grp.
of Tenn., Inc., 277 S.W.3d 896, 898 (Tenn. 2009). However, “[n]o similar deference need
be afforded the trial court’s findings based upon documentary evidence.” Goodman v.
Schwarz Paper Co., No. W2016-02594-SC-R3-WC, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 8, at *6 (Tenn.
Workers’ Comp. Panel Jan. 18, 2018). Moreover, the interpretation and application of
statutes and regulations are questions of law that are reviewed de novo with no presumption
of correctness afforded the trial court’s conclusions. See Batey v. Deliver This, Inc., 568 S.W.3d 91, 95-96 (Tenn. 2019). We are also mindful of our obligation to construe the
workers’ compensation statutes “fairly, impartially, and in accordance with basic principles
of statutory construction” and in a way that does not favor either the employee or the
employer. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-116 (2024).
                                                Analysis
       On appeal, Employer asserts “the trial court erred and abused its discretion by
placing a limitation on Employer’s statutory right to an IME and finding that Employer’s
entitlement to an IME was subject to Amazon’s first honoring a referral to orthopedist
Christopher Jones before the IME could proceed.” Specifically, Employer argues that the
court improperly applied Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-204 and failed to give
“proper weight” to the statutory language that an employee “must submit to examination
4
  Although not relevant to the appeal in this case, the trial court also referred Employer to the Compliance
Program for investigation pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-118(a)(8) for Employer’s
failure to timely provide reasonable and necessary medical treatment recommended by the authorized
treating physician.
                                                     4
by the employer’s physician at all reasonable times.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-204(d)(1)
(2024). Conversely, Employee asserts the court did not err and properly ordered Employer
to comply with the referral of the authorized treating physician from July 2024 before she
would be required to attend the employer examination with Dr. Hazlewood.
        In general, we agree with Employer’s assertion that an injured worker must attend
an employer’s examination “at all reasonable times” during the course of a claim. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-204(d)(1). In the present case, however, Employer’s right to obtain an
employer’s examination is not disputed. In fact, the court granted Employer’s motion to
compel Employee to attend an examination with Dr. Hazlewood and noted that, pursuant
to section 50-6-204(d)(1), an “injured employee must submit to examination by the
employer’s physician at all reasonable times if requested to do so by the employer.”
(Emphasis added.) The court, citing our previous decision in King v. Big Binder Express,
LLC, No. 2016-07-0378, 2016 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 92, at *9 (Tenn. Workers’
Comp. App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2016), also stressed, however, that “an employer’s right to an
examination of an employee pursuant to section 50-6-204(d)(1) by a physician of the
employer’s choosing is not without limits. Both by statute and case law, the employer’s
request must be reasonable.” As the trial court noted, the employer’s request must be made
at a “reasonable time” and “be reasonable, as a whole, in light of the surrounding
circumstances.” Citing id. at *10-11 (emphasis in original). Furthermore, as we have
stated numerous times, “a trial court has the necessary discretion to control the pace of
litigation through the use of case supervision and docket management.” Valladares v.
Transco Products, Inc., Nos. 2015-01-0117 & -0118, 2016 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd.
LEXIS 31, at *26 (Tenn. Workers’ Comp. App. Bd. July 27, 2016).
        In the case at hand, it is undisputed that during Employee’s first visit with her panel-
selected, authorized treating physician on July 3, 2024, Dr. Thomas made a direct referral
to Dr. Jones, an orthopedic surgeon. Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-
204(a)(3)(A)(ii), Employer had three business days after receiving that referral to either
authorize the referral or offer a panel of alternative specialists. It did neither. Instead,
Employer attempted to schedule an employer’s examination with Dr. Hazlewood, which
Employee declined to attend. Subsequently, the following month, Dr. Thomas made four
additional referrals, but it was not until February 2025, seven months after the original
referral, that Employer filed its motion to compel Employee’s attendance at the
appointment with Dr. Hazlewood. In short, the trial court determined that both parties bear
certain obligations and that Employer must comply with its statutorily-mandated obligation
to authorize a referral for treatment before Employee will be compelled to appear for its
employer’s examination. Under the circumstances of this case, we agree.
                                         Conclusion
        For the foregoing reasons, the trial court’s order is affirmed in its entirety, and the
case is remanded. Costs on appeal are taxed to Employer.

           IN RE VOLT ELECTRICITY PROVIDER, LP, Relator


            Original Proceeding on Petition for Writ of Mandamus


                          MEMORANDUM OPINION

      Relator, Volt Electricity Provider, LP, has filed a petition for a writ of

mandamus challenging the trial court’s order denying its plea to the jurisdiction and

its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction which asserted that the

claims of real party in interest, Dalal Said, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Public Utility Commission (the “PUC”) pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory

Act.1

        We deny relator’s petition for writ of mandamus.2

        Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is only available in limited

circumstances. See Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40 (Tex. 1992).

“Mandamus relief is available only if the trial court clearly abused its discretion and

the party has no adequate remedy by appeal.” In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 

35 S.W.3d602, 605 (Tex. 2000). Generally, mandamus relief is not available to correct

incidental trial court rulings where there is a remedy by appeal, including the

granting or denial of a plea to the jurisdiction. See In re Entergy Corp., 

142 S.W.3d316, 320 (Tex. 2004). However, Texas law recognizes an exception to this general

rule, allowing mandamus review of a trial court’s order denying a plea to the

jurisdiction where a party has failed to exhaust administrative remedies before the

PUC because “permitting a trial to go forward would interfere with the important

legislatively mandated function and purpose of the PUC.” Id. at 321; see also In re

Tex.-N.M. Power Co., No. 10-19-00166-CV, 2019 WL 3822274, at *2 (Tex. App.—

Waco Aug. 14, 2019, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.).


1
        See TEX. UTIL. CODE § 11.001 et seq.
2
        The underlying case is Dalal Said, on behalf of herself and all others similarly
        situated v. Volt Electricity Provider, LP, Cause No. 2020-13088, in the 215th
        District Court of Harris County, Texas, the Honorable Elaine Palmer presiding.

                                            2
      While this exception applies here, the burden to establish an abuse of

discretion by the trial court remains with relator, who must show that the trial court

has reached a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and

prejudicial error of law by its failure to analyze or apply the law correctly. See In re

Olshan Found. Repair Co., 328 S.W.3d 883, 888 (Tex. 2010). We conclude that

relator has not demonstrated that the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in

denying relator’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss.

      Accordingly, we deny relator’s petition for writ of mandamus. See TEX. R.

APP. P. 52.8(a), (d). All pending motions are dismissed as moot.

                                   PER CURIAM
Panel consists of Justices Goodman, Landau, and Adams.

""7. The relator did not demonstrate that the trial court’s denial of its plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss constituted such an abuse of discretion."",
""8. Because the relator failed to satisfy its burden, mandamus relief is not warranted.""

 Judge Pamela K. Chen, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
1

New York, sitting by designation. 

                                                        1 
       
      Plaintiffs, a group of electrical generators and trade groups of electrical 
generators, appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Caproni, J.) granting Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) 
motions to dismiss.  Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of New York’s Zero 
Emissions Credit (“ZEC”) program, which subsidizes qualifying nuclear power 
plants with “ZECs”: state‐created and state‐issued credits certifying the zero‐
emission attributes of electricity produced by a participating nuclear plant. 

      Plaintiffs argue that the program is preempted under the Federal Power 
Act (“FPA”) and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause.  We conclude as 
follows: (1) the ZEC program is not field preempted because Plaintiffs have 
failed to identify an impermissible “tether” under Hughes v. Talen Energy 
Marketing, LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1293 (2016), between the ZEC program and 
wholesale market participation; (2) the ZEC program is not conflict preempted 
because Plaintiffs have failed to identify any clear damage to federal goals; and 
(3) Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to raise a dormant Commerce Clause claim.  
Affirmed.

DENNIS JACOBS, Circuit Judge: 
 
       Plaintiffs, a group of electrical generators and trade groups of electrical 
generators, appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Caproni, J.) granting Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) 
motions to dismiss.  In August 2016, the New York Public Service Commission 
(“PSC”) adopted the Zero Emissions Credit (“ZEC”) program as part of a larger 
energy reform plan to reduce greenhouse‐gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030.  
The program subsidizes qualifying nuclear power plants by creating “ZECs”: 
state‐created and state‐issued credits certifying the zero‐emission attributes of 
electricity produced by a participating nuclear plant.  The PSC has determined 
that three nuclear power plants (FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point) qualify 
for the ZEC program; other facilities, including facilities located outside New 
York, may be selected in the future. 
 
       Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program influences the prices that result 
from the wholesale auction system established by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (“FERC”) and distorts the market mechanism for determining 
which energy generators should close.  Plaintiffs challenge the program’s 
constitutionality on two grounds: that the program is preempted under the 
Federal Power Act (“FPA”) and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause.  



                                        5 
Defendants, who are members of the PSC, and Intervenors, who are the nuclear 
generators (and their owners, including Exelon Corporation) receiving ZECs, 
moved to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack a private cause of action to 
pursue their preemption claims because the FPA implicitly forecloses equity 
jurisdiction, and that (in any event) Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law. 
 
       We conclude that the ZEC program is not field preempted, because 
Plaintiffs have failed to identify an impermissible “tether” under Hughes v. 
Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1293 (2016) between the ZEC 
program and wholesale market participation; that the ZEC program is not 
conflict preempted, because Plaintiffs have failed to identify any clear damage to 
federal goals; and that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing as to the dormant 
Commerce Clause claim.  These conclusions are consistent with the recent 
Seventh Circuit decision in Elec. Power Supply Assʹn v. Star, No. 17‐2433, 2018 
WL 4356683, at *1 (7th Cir. Sept. 13, 2018). 
 
       The judgment of the district court is affirmed. 
        
                                            I 
                                              
                                            A 
 
       The FPA establishes a collaborative scheme between the states and federal 
government to regulate electricity generation.  States have exclusive jurisdiction 
over “facilities used for the generation of electric energy,” including production 
and retail sales.  16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1).  FERC regulates electricity sales at 
wholesale, ensuring “rates and charges made, demanded, or received . . . for or 
in connection with” such sales are “just and reasonable.”  Id. § 824d(a). 
        
       FERC has determined that just and reasonable rates for wholesale 
electricity should be set by competitive auctions.  The New York Independent 
System Operator (“NYISO”) manages two types of wholesale auctions under 
FERC‐approved rules and procedures: energy and capacity.  In energy auctions, 
generators bid the lowest price they will accept to sell a given quantity of 
electrical output; in capacity auctions, generators bid (and NYISO purchases) 
options to call upon the generator to produce a specified quantity of electricity in 



                                         6 
the future.  Both types of auction employ “stacking” of bids from lowest to 
highest price until demand is satisfied.  App’x 50, 54 (Compl. ¶¶ 33, 39‐40).  The 
price of the highest‐stacked bid sets the “market clearing price.”  Id.  Any 
generator that bids at or below the market clearing price “clears” the auction and 
receives the market clearing price, regardless of the price the generator actually 
bid.  Id.  “A high clearing price in the capacity auction encourages new 
generators to enter the market, increasing supply and thereby lowering the 
clearing price . . . .  [A] low clearing price discourages new entry and encourages 
retirement of existing high‐cost generators.”  Hughes, 136 S. Ct. at 1293.   
 
        Nuclear generators bid into the NYISO auctions as price‐takers: since, 
unlike other types of electricity generation, they are unable to vary their output 
depending on price, they sell their entire output at the market clearing price, 
even if the price is below the cost of production. 
 
                                             B 
 
        In August 2016, the PSC issued the Clean Energy Standard (“CES”) Order 
as an overall scheme to reduce greenhouse‐gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030.  
The CES Order created two programs that bear upon this appeal: Renewable 
Energy Credits (“RECs”) and ZECs.  Plaintiffs challenge only the ZEC program, 
arguing that it is preempted by the FPA and violates the dormant Commerce 
Clause. 
 
        The REC program awards to generators one REC for each megawatt‐hour 
(MWh) of energy that is produced from renewable sources like wind and solar.  
App’x 190 (CES Order at 106).  The New York State Energy Research and 
Development Authority (“NYSERDA”) purchases RECs from generators, 
thereby providing them a subsidy.  App’x 100 (CES Order at 16).  In turn, 
NYSERDA sells the RECs to local utilities that sell energy to consumers at retail.  
Id.  The CES Order requires the utilities either to purchase RECs in an amount 
based on the percentage of the total load served by that utility or to make an 
alternative compliance payment.  App’x 98‐100 (CES Order at 14‐16).  The 
utilities may (and no doubt do) pass on the cost of RECs to consumers.  App’x 
101 (CES Order at 17). 
 



                                         7 
       The ZEC program aims to prevent nuclear generators that do not emit 
carbon dioxide from retiring until renewable sources of energy can pick up the 
slack.  A ZEC is a subsidy: a “credit for the zero‐emissions attributes of one 
megawatt‐hour of electricity production by” a participating nuclear power plant.  
App’x 254.  The PSC selects plants for the ZEC program based on five criteria: (1) 
“verifiable historic contribution . . . to the clean energy resource mix . . . in New 
York”; (2) the degree to which projected wholesale revenues are insufficient to 
prevent retirement; (3) costs and benefits of ZECs relative to clean‐energy 
alternatives; (4) impacts on ratepayers; and (5) the public interest.  App’x 208 
(CES Order at 124).  Based on these criteria, the PSC chose three nuclear plants 
for the ZEC program: FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point; it is asserted that 
other facilities, including facilities located outside New York, may be selected in 
the future.  App’x 209 (CES Order at 125). 
        
       The ZEC price is based on the so‐called “social cost of carbon”: a federal 
inter‐agency task force’s estimate of the damage from carbon emissions, which 
the PSC uses to measure the hypothetical environmental damage from nuclear 
plants’ retirement.  App’x 215 (CES Order at 131).2  The PSC then subtracts the 
portion of that cost already captured through New York’s participation in the 
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”), and multiplies the result by the 
tons of carbon avoided per MWh of zero‐emission energy.  App’x 219‐20 (CES 
Order at 135‐36).  The ZEC price generated for the program’s first two years is 
$17.48.  App’x 69 (Compl ¶ 70).  Accordingly, “each qualifying nuclear generator 
will get an additional $17.48 for each MWh of electricity it generates (subject to a 
possible cap), in addition to the price the facility receives for the sale of the 
electricity and capacity in the [NYISO] market.”  Id. 
 
       Beginning in 2019, the PSC intends to calculate a new ZEC price every two 
years.  The price may be reduced based on two considerations.  First, if the New 
York energy market experiences “additional renewable energy penetration,” 
App’x 221 (CES Order at 137), the price will fall, reflecting the reduced value of 
nuclear plants if renewable energy generation gains steam.  Second, the ZEC 
price may be adjusted downward based on forecast wholesale prices.  App’x 222

Climate Change While Strengthening the Nation’s Energy System, 44 COLUM. J. ENVTL. L. 
(forthcoming Jan. 2019). 

                                              8 
(CES Order at 138).  For each two‐year period, the PSC calculates a “reference 
price forecast” that is equal to the sum of forecast NYISO “Zone A” (i.e., Western 
New York) energy and capacity prices during the period.  Id.  The reference price 
forecast is not paid to the ZEC plants, but rather sets a benchmark for reducing 
the ZEC price: if the reference price forecast exceeds $39/MWh (a historical 
approximation of Zone A energy and capacity prices), the two‐year ZEC price is 
reduced by the difference.  Id. 
 
       As in the REC program, the NYSERDA purchases ZECs from the selected 
plants, and local utilities are required to purchase ZECs from NYSERDA in 
proportion to its share of total state electric load.  App’x 70‐71 (Compl. ¶ 73).  
Alternatively, the utilities may purchase both ZECs and energy directly from the 
generators.  App’x 235‐36 (CES Order at 151‐52).  The utilities may then pass 
along these costs to consumers. 
        
                                              C 
        
       The complaint, filed October 19, 2016, alleges that the ZEC program alters 
the prices that result from FERC’s auction system and distorts the market 
mechanism for determining which nuclear power plants should close.  The 
subsidized nuclear generators receive the value of the ZECs in addition to what 
they earn in the wholesale markets; as a result (it is alleged), New York “is using 
the ZEC subsidy to exert a large depressive effect on energy and capacity prices, 
which one group of experts estimated at $15 billion over 12 years.”  App’x 58‐59 
(Compl. ¶ 47).  Plaintiffs claim that the depressive effect will cause (1) generators 
(such as themselves) to receive a lower price than they would have otherwise 
and, as a result, (2) their bids to fail to clear auctions when they otherwise would 
have cleared.  App’x 71, 74 (Compl. ¶¶ 74, 87). 
        
       Accordingly, the complaint claims that the ZEC portion of the CES Order 
is both field and conflict preempted by FERC’s authority over wholesale 
electricity sales, and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause because the 
ZECs benefit only nuclear power plants located in New York.  App’x 42‐43 
(Compl. ¶¶ 7‐8).  The nuclear plants (and their owners), beneficiaries of the ZEC 
program, intervened as a Defendant.   
 



                                          9 
       The district court granted the motions by Intervenors and the state 
Defendants to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  As to the preemption claim, the court 
held that the FPA forecloses parties from invoking equity jurisdiction to bring a 
claim under the FPA, and that, in any event, Plaintiffs failed to state a plausible 
claim.  As to the Commerce Clause claim, the court held that Plaintiffs lack a 
cause of action because their alleged injuries did not fall within the zone of 
interests protected by the dormant Commerce Clause; as to the merits, the court 
held the Plaintiffs’ claim fails because New York was acting as a market 
participant, rather than a regulator, when it created ZECs. 
        
       This appeal followed. 
 
                                           II 
 
       We review de novo a district court’s grant of a motion to dismiss under 
Rule 12(b)(6), “construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual 
allegations as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.”  
Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 230 (2d Cir. 2016).  The complaint 
must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  
“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that 
allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for 
the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  For Rule 12(b)(6) purposes, the complaint 
“include[s] any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements 
or documents incorporated in it by reference.”  Allco Finance Ltd. v. Klee, 
861 F.3d 82, 97 n.13 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
        
                                          III 
 
       Plaintiffs invoke the court’s equity jurisdiction to prevent enforcement of 
the CES Order on the ground that it is preempted by the FPA, while Defendants 
argue that such jurisdiction is implicitly foreclosed by the same statute.  See 
Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, 135 S. Ct. 1378 (2015).  However, as the 
Seventh Circuit recognized in Electric Power Supply Association, this dispute 
does not implicate the district court’s subject‐matter jurisdiction, which rests 
securely on 18 U.S.C. § 1331 and 16 U.S.C. § 825p.  See 2018 WL 4356683, at *1.  



                                         10 
We need not consider the parties’ disagreement regarding equity jurisdiction 
because we conclude (as did the Seventh Circuit) that federal law does not 
preempt the state statute ‐‐ that is, since Plaintiffs’ claims fail either on the merits 
or for lack of standing, the question regarding equity is obviated. 
 
                                           IV 
 
       The laws of the United States are “the supreme Law of the Land . . . any 
Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  
U.S. Const. art. VI cl. 2.  Congress therefore may preempt state law through 
federal legislation.  “Our inquiry into the scope of a [federal] statuteʹs pre‐
emptive effect is guided by the rule that the purpose of Congress is the ultimate 
touchstone in every pre‐emption case.”  Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 
555 U.S. 70, 76 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).   
 
       If Congress has not expressly preempted a state statute, it may do so 
implicitly through either “field” or “conflict” preemption.  Under field 
preemption, a state law is preempted if “Congress has legislated 
comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the 
States to supplement federal law.”  Nw. Cent. Pipeline Corp. v. State Corp. 
Commʹn of Kan., 489 U.S. 493, 509 (1989).  Conflict preemption arises “where 
compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or where the state law 
stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes 
and objectives of Congress.”  Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1591, 1599 
(2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs challenge the ZEC program 
on both scores.  We consider field preemption first and conflict preemption next. 
 
                                            V 
 
       The FPA divides responsibility for regulating energy between the states 
and the federal government.  FERC has exclusive power to regulate “the sale of 
electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.”  16 U.S.C § 824(a).  FERC 
must ensure that “[a]ll rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any 
public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable.”  16 
U.S.C. § 824d(a).  While FERC’s authority extends to “rules or practices affecting 



                                          11 
wholesale rates,” this affecting jurisdiction is limited to “rules or practices that 
directly affect the [wholesale] rate” so that FERC’s jurisdiction does not “assum[e] 
near‐infinite breadth.”  FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n, 136 S. Ct. 760, 774 
(2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis and alteration in original). 
        
       However, “the law places beyond FERC’s power, and leaves to the States 
alone, the regulation of ‘any other sale’—most notably, any retail sale—of 
electricity.”  Id. at 766 (quoting 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)).  The states are thus 
authorized to regulate energy production, 16 U.S.C. § 824(b), and facilities used 
for the generation of electric energy, 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1).  See Pac. Gas & Elec. 
Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation and Dev. Commʹn, 461 U.S. 190, 205 (1983) 
(“Need for new power facilities, their economic feasibility, and rates and 
services, are areas that have been characteristically governed by the States.”). 
        
       When “coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary 
administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for 
federal pre‐emption becomes a less persuasive one.” New York State Dept. of 
Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 421 (1973).  Courts must avoid mistaking 
the “‘congressionally designed interplay between state and federal regulation’ 
for impermissible tension that requires pre‐emption under the Supremacy 
Clause.” Hughes, 136 S. Ct. at 1300 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quoting 
Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 518).  In this Circuit, there is a “strong 
presumption against finding that the [State’s] powers” are preempted by the 
FPA, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Hudson River‐Black River Regulating 
Dist., 673 F.3d 84, 94 (2d Cir. 2012), legislation that was “drawn with meticulous 
regard for the continued exercise of state power,” Rochester Gas & Elec. Corp. v. 
PSC of N.Y., 754 F.2d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 1985).  That presumption may be overcome 
only if displacing state authority was Congress’ “clear and manifest purpose.”  
Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565 (2009). 
        
                                            A 
 
       An FPA field preemption claim was recently considered by the Supreme 
Court in Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288 (2016).  A 
Maryland program required utilities to enter into a “contract‐for‐differences” 
with a favored power plant.  135 S. Ct. at 1294.  Local utilities were required to 



                                         12 
pay the shortfall if the plant cleared the capacity auction, but the clearing price 
fell below the state‐determined contract price; if the clearing price exceeded the 
contract price, the plant paid the difference to the utilities.  Id. at 1295.  The 
Maryland program thus provided subsidies to the generator that were 
conditioned on the generator’s sale of capacity into a FERC‐regulated auction.  
Id. at 1292.  By guaranteeing a rate distinct from the auction clearing price, 
“Maryland’s program invade[d] FERC’s regulatory turf,” and was therefore 
preempted.  Id. at 1297.   
        
       The Court cautioned, however, that “[n]othing in this opinion should be 
read to foreclose Maryland and other States from encouraging production of new 
or clean generation through measures untethered to a generatorʹs wholesale market 
participation.”  Id. at 1299 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).  
The Court expressly left open the viability of other measures to develop energy 
generation, such as “tax incentives, land grants, direct subsidies, construction of 
state‐owned generation facilities, or re‐regulation of the energy sector.”  Id.  “So 
long as a State does not condition payment of funds on capacity clearing the 
auction, the State’s program would not suffer from the fatal defect that renders 
Maryland’s program unacceptable.”  Id. 
        
       Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is indistinguishable from the 
Maryland program preempted in Hughes.  The program is said to be “expressly 
tethered to wholesale prices resulting from the NYISO auctions” because (1) “the 
state requires [utilities] to make up the difference between the state’s rate and the 
FERC‐approved market rates”; (2) “the subsidy varies inversely with FERC‐
approved auction rates”; and (3) “the subsidy is ‘received’ by the favored 
producers ‘in connection with’ the sale of electricity on wholesale markets.”  Br. 
of Appellants 6, 32 (quoting 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a), 824d(e)).  Plaintiffs 
mischaracterize Hughes and the ZEC program. 
 
       The Maryland contract‐for‐differences program insulated generators from 
fluctuations in wholesale prices by guaranteeing that they would receive “the 
difference between . . . the clearing price” and the state‐determined “price 
guaranteed in the contract for differences.”  Hughes, 135 S. Ct. at 1295.  New 
York’s scheme avoids (or skirts) the Hughes prohibition.  Until 2019, the ZEC 
price cannot vary from the social cost of carbon, as determined by a federal 



                                         13 
interagency workgroup.  App’x 213–14, 266.  After 2019, the ZEC price is fixed 
for two‐year periods, and does not fluctuate during those periods to match the 
wholesale clearing price.  Because the fixed ZEC price is capped based on an 
independent variable (the social cost of carbon), generators are exposed to 
market risk in the event that energy prices fall.  Moreover, the price may be fixed 
below the social cost of carbon, but only on the basis of forecast wholesale prices ‐
‐ forecasts based on futures prices that FERC does not regulate, Hunter v. FERC, 
711 F.3d 155, 157 (D.C. Cir. 2013) ‐‐ and there is no true‐up to reconcile forecasts 
with actual rates.  The ZEC price also adjusts based on the amount of renewable 
energy generation in New York.  App’x 221 (CES Order at 137).  Accordingly, 
there is no support for Plaintiffs’ contention that the “subsidy varies in almost 
exactly the same manner” as in Hughes.  Br. of Appellants 38.   
 
        Plaintiffs argue that Hughes preempts state programs if they are tethered 
to “FERC‐regulated wholesale electricity prices.”  Br. of Appellants 10; see also 
id. at 40–42, 48.  But the tether in Hughes is tied to “wholesale market 
participation,” not prices, 136 S. Ct. at 1299 (emphasis added); the Maryland 
program was unlawful because it conditioned payment on auction sales. 
 
        As the district court held, Rochester Gas forecloses Plaintiffs’ price‐
tethering theory.  It was argued in that case that the FPA preempted the PSC’s 
policy of calculating intrastate retail rates by making a “reasonable estimate” of 
wholesale sales revenues.  Id. at 100–01.  We held that tying retail prices (which 
are under state jurisdiction) to estimates of wholesale revenues (which are under 
FERC’s) is permissible because there is “a distinction between” a state 
impermissibly “regulating [wholesale] sales” and a state “reflecting the profits 
from a reasonable estimate of those sales” when acting within its jurisdiction.  Id. 
at 105. 
 
        Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish Rochester Gas on two grounds.  First, they 
argue that Rochester Gas addresses only retail rate‐making, whereas the ZEC 
program addresses wholesale rate‐making.  But that argument mischaracterizes 
the ZEC program, which avoids setting wholesale prices and instead regulates 
the environmental attributes of energy generation and in the process considers 
forecasts of wholesale pricing. 
         



                                         14 
        Second, Plaintiffs distinguish Rochester Gas on the ground that the ZEC 
program has a direct impact on the generators’ “position toward” the wholesale 
markets.  Br. of Appellants 39.  But the same was true in Rochester Gas: the PSC 
policy allowed generators to keep operating, regardless of wholesale revenue, 
because recovery of costs was guaranteed through retail rates.  What mattered in 
Rochester Gas was whether the retail rate adjustment, which factored in expected 
wholesale revenues, intruded on FERC’s jurisdictional turf by compelling 
wholesale market participation.  The analogous question here would be whether 
ZECs compel generators to make wholesale sales.  We conclude that they do not. 
         
        Plaintiffs argue that the plants’ owners are “Exempt Wholesale 
Generators” (“EWGs”), which are “legally required to sell their output into 
wholesale markets.”  Br. of Appellants 33.  Accepting the allegations of the 
complaint as true (and ignoring the fact that neither Exelon nor LIPA have EWG 
status), Plaintiffs point to nothing in the CES Order that requires the ZEC plants 
to participate in the wholesale market.  EWG status affords an exemption from 
certain regulations; but a ZEC plant may relinquish EWG status in order to sell 
directly to consumers (if it deems the tradeoff worthwhile) ‐‐ and still receive 
ZECs.  As the district court concluded, a generator’s decision to sell power into 
the wholesale markets is a business decision that does not give rise to 
preemption concerns.  Special App’x 20‐21.  Accordingly, there is no support for 
Plaintiffs’ assertion that the CES Order tethers the ZEC plants’ receipt of ZECs to 
participation in the wholesale markets ‐‐ the “fatal defect” that doomed the 
contract‐for‐differences program in Hughes.  136 S. Ct. at 1299. 
         
        Citing Allco Finance Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2015), Plaintiffs argue 
that the absence of a statutory compulsion for generators to sell into the 
wholesale market does not save a state program that would otherwise be 
preempted.  Allco considered a Connecticut statute that arranged for utilities to 
enter into bilateral wholesale electricity contracts with renewable energy 
generators.  The plaintiff argued that the statute “[c]ompe[lled] a wholesale 
transaction” between the generators and utilities and thus regulated wholesale 
sales.  Id. at 97.  We disagreed, because generators and utilities (rather than the 
state) made the ultimate decision to sign the contracts.  Id. at 98, 100.   
         
        Plaintiffs contend that Allco supports their argument because the Court 



                                          15 
emphasized that the contracts were subject to FERC evaluation as just and 
reasonable, whereas the ZEC transactions are not.  Id. at 199.  However, the 
evident reason that the contracts were subject to FERC review is that they were 
contracts for wholesale electricity sales, over which FERC has jurisdiction.  Here, 
the only transactions New York compels are ZEC sales, and ZECs are sold 
separately from wholesale sales.  Because there is no wholesale sale when ZECs 
change hands, FERC lacks jurisdiction to decide whether the ZEC transactions 
are just and reasonable.  Allco is therefore inapposite. 
        
                                            B 
 
       Plaintiffs concede that the ZEC program “does not expressly mandate that 
the plants receiving ZEC subsidies bid into the NYISO auctions,” Br. of 
Appellants 8; rather, they argue that the “practical effect” of the ZEC program is 
to regulate wholesale prices, id. at 35, and that a state law is preempted even if it 
does not formally regulate wholesale prices, if that is its practical effect.  
Plaintiffs rely on Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Commission of 
Kansas, 372 U.S. 84 (1963), in which a Kansas law requiring an interstate pipeline 
to purchase gas ratably from producers was preempted by the Natural Gas Act 
(“NGA”).3  The state rule did not expressly regulate wholesale prices, but the 
Court reasoned that “our inquiry is not at an end because the orders do not deal 
in terms with prices or volumes of purchases . . . .  The federal regulatory scheme 
leaves no room either for direct state regulation of the prices of interstate 
wholesales of natural gas, or for state regulations which would indirectly achieve 
the same result.”  Id. at 90‐91 (citations omitted). 
 
       However, Northern Natural held that the Kansas law was preempted 
because it was “unmistakably and unambiguously directed at purchasers [i.e., 
interstate pipelines] who take gas in Kansas for resale after transportation in 
interstate commerce.”  Id. at 92.  The Court emphasized that “our cases have 
consistently recognized a significant distinction,” with “constitutional 
consequences, between conservation measures aimed directly at interstate 
purchasers and wholesales for resale, and those aimed at producers and 
production.”  Id. at 94. 

3 The Supreme Court has “routinely relied on NGA cases in determining the scope of 
the FPA.”  Hughes, 136 S. Ct. at 1298 n. 10. 

                                         16 
         
        This distinction between regulating purchasers and producers yielded the 
opposite result in Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v. State Corp. Commission 
of Kansas, 489 U.S. 493 (1989).  Kansas hit on another way to encourage interstate 
pipelines to purchase additional Kansas‐Hugoton gas, but did so by regulating 
the producers: unless they produced their allowable quantity of gas within a 
certain timeframe, they would lose the right to produce it later ‐‐ and of course 
the pipelines could not purchase gas unless it was produced.  Id. at 497, 505.  
Relying on Northern Natural for the proposition that federal law preempts state 
regulations that have “either a direct or indirect effect on matters within federal 
control,” the pipelines asked the Court to invalidate the Kansas rule “because it 
exert[ed] pressure” on them to “increase purchases from Hugoton producers.”  
Id. at 497, 507.   
         
        FERC’s brief to the Court argued that while Kansas “intended to 
influence” the pipeline’s purchasing decisions, the state did “no more than fix[] 
limits on when producers may produce their gas” and therefore stayed within its 
jurisdiction.  Northwest Central FERC Br. at *20.  Furthermore, FERC regulation 
of the pipelines does not “protect [them] from the effect of state regulations that 
form the environment in which [they] conduct[] business within the state.”  Id. at 
*32.   
         
        The Supreme Court agreed: it would be “strange indeed” to hold that 
Congress intended to allow the states to regulate production, but only if doing so 
did not affect interstate rates.  Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 512‐13.  In Northern 
Natural, Kansas “crossed the dividing line . . . by imposing purchasing 
requirements on interstate pipelines,” but in Northwest Central, the state 
achieved the same end result by “regulat[ing] production,” a matter “firmly on 
the States’ side of that dividing line.”  Id.  The Court concluded that “we must 
take seriously the lines Congress drew in establishing [this] dual regulatory 
system,” and therefore held that the Kansas law was not preempted.  Id. 
         
        New York has kept the line in sight, and gone as near as can be without 
crossing it.  ZECs are created when electricity is produced in a statutorily‐
defined manner, regardless of whether or how the electricity is ultimately sold.  
They are defined as “the zero‐emissions attributes of one megawatt‐hour of 



                                         17 
electricity production by an eligible Zero Carbon Electric Generating Facility.”  
App’x 254 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, Northwest Central defeats Plaintiffs’ 
argument premised on practical effect: even though the ZEC program exerts 
downward pressure on wholesale electricity rates, that incidental effect is 
insufficient to state a claim for field preemption under the FPA. 
        
                                            C 
 
       FERC has confirmed that REC programs fall within the jurisdiction of the 
states, which is telling because RECs and ZECs share many similar 
characteristics.  WSPP, Inc., 139 FERC ¶ 61,061 (2012), concerned an agreement 
that facilitated wholesale sales among 300 Canadian and American parties.  The 
parties asked FERC to determine if it had jurisdiction over “unbundled” REC 
transactions.  Id. PP 2, 5 & 9.  FERC asserted jurisdiction over bundled REC 
transactions, in which “a wholesale energy sale and a REC sale take place as part 
of the same transaction,” but disclaimed jurisdiction over unbundled REC sales.  
Id.  “RECs are state‐created and state‐issued instruments certifying that electric 
energy was generated pursuant to certain requirements.”  Id. P 21.  When RECs 
are unbundled, the payment is “not a charge in connection with a wholesale 
sale,” does not “affect wholesale electricity rates,” and therefore “falls outside 
FERC jurisdiction.”  Id. P 24. 
        
       As the district court observed: “Like a REC, a ZEC is a certification of an 
energy attribute that is separate from a wholesale charge or rate . . . .  Like a REC, 
the purchase or sale of a ZEC is independent of the purchase or sale of wholesale 
energy.  Like a REC, payment for a ZEC is not conditioned on the generator’s 
participation in the wholesale auction; rather, RECs and ZECs are given in 
exchange for the renewable energy or zero‐emissions production of energy by 
generators.”  Special App’x 27 (emphases in original).  Plaintiffs argue that ZECs 
and RECs are nevertheless distinguishable for the purposes of preemption 
analysis, for two reasons. 
        
       First, Plaintiffs argue that, unlike RECs, the ZEC subsidy is tethered to 
wholesale prices.  For reasons explained above, Plaintiffs’ price‐tethering theory 
is foreclosed by Hughes and Rochester Gas; furthermore, it mischaracterizes the 
ZEC program: ZEC prices are capped by the social cost of carbon, and may 



                                          18 
adjust downwards in future years on the basis of forecast wholesale energy 
prices.   See supra Part V.A. 
        
       Second, Plaintiffs allege that ZECs are available only to generators that sell 
in the NYISO auctions, thereby guaranteeing that ZEC transactions are tied to the 
sale of electricity at wholesale.  True, ZEC plants may sell the electricity they 
generate into the wholesale auction, and all of them may well do so, but (as 
described above, supra at Part V.B), there is no support for Plaintiffs’ argument 
that the CES Order requires ZEC plants to sell power into the wholesale market.  
Under the program, the production of zero‐emissions energy results in the 
creation of ZECs; how those plants sell their electricity is a business decision that 
does not raise preemption concerns.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ two proposed 
distinctions fall flat. 
        
       Plaintiffs rely on a distortion of WSPP’s holding.  First, they assert that 
FERC “was careful to limit its holding to the features of the three specific REC 
products before it.”  Br. of Appellants 42.  However, WSPP clearly disclaims 
FERC jurisdiction over RECs when they are sold separately from electricity: the 
only REC feature that was dispositive was whether the REC was “unbundled” 
(sold separately from electricity) or “bundled” (sold together).  139 FERC ¶ 
61,064, P 24.  There is no dispute that ZECs are similarly unbundled from 
electricity transactions.  Second, Plaintiffs quote FERC’s observation that REC 
(and therefore presumably ZEC) transactions “could still fall under [FERC’s 
jurisdiction” if they were “in connection with” or “affect[ed]” wholesale rates.  
Br. of Appellants 43 (quoting 139 FERC ¶ 61,061 P 22).  But when FERC applied 
this jurisdictional standard two paragraphs later, it held (categorically) that 
unbundled REC transactions are not “in connection with a wholesale sale” and 
“do[] not affect wholesale electricity rates.”  139 FERC ¶ 61,061 P 24.  Finally, 
Plaintiffs emphasize that the REC program had “no connection to an organized 
market with energy and capacity auctions.”  Br. of Appellants 42.  But WSPP 
acknowledged that some REC recipients (like certain ZEC recipients) are EWGs, 
who are required to sell their output exclusively at wholesale.  139 FERC ¶ 61,061 
P 9.  And several states addressed in WSPP required renewable generators to bid 
into wholesale auctions.  See West‐Wide Must‐Offer Requirements, 157 FERC ¶ 
61, 051, PP 2–5 (2016) (western states subject to must‐offer capacity mandate from 
2001 to 2016 to address California energy crisis).  Yet WSPP nevertheless upheld 



                                         19 
their REC programs. 
 
       It is telling that Plaintiffs cannot persuasively explain why FERC’s holding 
regarding RECs does not apply equally to ZECs.  We conclude that Plaintiffs 
have failed to state a plausible claim of field preemption. 
 
                                            VI 
 
       A state law may be conflict preempted if it “stands as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,” 
Oneok, 135 S. Ct. at 1595, or “interferes with the method by which the federal 
statute was designed to reach this goal,” Int’l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 
479 U.S. 481, 494 (1987).  Given the FPA’s dual regulatory scheme, “conflict‐pre‐emption 
analysis must be applied sensitively in this area, so as to prevent the diminution 
of the role Congress reserved to the States while at the same time preserving the 
federal role.”  Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 515.  So long as a state is 
“regulat[ing] production or other subjects of state jurisdiction, and the means 
chosen [are] at least plausibly . . . related to matters of legitimate state concern,” 
there is no conflict preemption “unless clear damage to federal goals would 
result.”  Id. at 518, 522.   
        
       The FPA seeks to ensure, through FERC, that rates for wholesale sales 
remain just and reasonable, while simultaneously preserving state authority to 
regulate generation facilities and retail sales.  16 U.S.C. §§ 824d(a), 824(b).  As 
explained above, the ZEC program regulates production: its stated aspiration is 
to “preserve existing zero‐emissions nuclear generation resources as a bridge to 
the clean energy future,” and to “prevent backsliding” that otherwise “likely 
could not be avoided.”  App’x 85, 229.  Accordingly, ZEC program is not conflict 
preempted unless Plaintiffs can show that it would cause clear damage to federal 
goals. 
        
       Plaintiffs describe “the very goal of FERC’s wholesale market design” as 
“competition from more efficient generators.”  Br. of Appellants 46.  ZECs, 
Plaintiffs argue, “enable[] the unprofitable plants to keep dumping substantial 
amounts of electricity in the FERC markets for over a decade, even though the 
FERC‐approved price signals should cause the plants to retire.”  Id.  



                                          20 
Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program “distort[s] price signals to all 
other wholesale generators by encouraging the favored generators to bid as price 
takers and thereby artificially depress market prices.”  Id.   
        
       However, FERC itself has sanctioned state programs that increase capacity 
or affect wholesale market prices, so long as the states regulate matters within 
their jurisdiction.  Thus, states may “grant loans, subsidies or tax credits to 
particular facilities on environmental or policy grounds,” Cal. PUC, 133 FERC ¶ 
61,059, P 31 n.62, including when that makes clean generation “more competitive 
in a cost comparison with fossil‐fueled generation” or “allow[s] states to affect” 
the price, S. Cal. Edison Co., 71 FERC ¶ 61,269, 62,080 (1995).  States may 
“require retirement of existing generators” or construction of “environmentally‐
friendly units, or . . . take any other action in their role as regulators of 
generation,” even though it may “affect[] the market clearing price.”  Conn. 
Dep’t of Pub. Util. Control v. FERC, 569 F.3d 477, 481 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see also 
New England States Comm. on Elec. v. ISO New England Inc., 142 FERC ¶ 
61,108, at 61,490 (2013) (LaFleur, Comm’r, concurring) (“[S]tates have the 
unquestioned right to make policy choices through the subsidization of 
capacity.”); N.Y. State PSC, 158 FERC ¶ 61,137, 2017 WL 496267, at *11 (2017) 
(Bay, Comm’r, concurring) (observing that “all energy resources” receive 
subsidies, and that “an idealized vision of markets free from the influence of 
public policies . . . does not exist”).  Similarly, FERC told the Supreme Court in 
Hughes that states are “free” to adopt such programs, “even if the price signals 
in the regional wholesale capacity market indicate that no [such] resources are 
needed.”  Hughes U.S. Amicus Brief at 33.   
        
       As explained above, Allco considered a state initiative to raise revenue for 
clean energy generators via long‐term bilateral contracts, thereby “increas[ing] 
the supply of electricity” and “plac[ing] downward pressure on” wholesale 
prices.  861 F.3d at 89.  But the Court concluded that “[t]his incidental effect on 
wholesale prices does not . . . amount to a regulation of the interstate wholesale 
electricity market that infringes on FERC’s jurisdiction.”  Id. at 1014; see also 

4 Allco did not explicitly state whether its holding fell under a field or conflict 
preemption analysis.  However, as the district court notes, Special App’x 33 n.22, there 
is no basis to conclude that an “incidental effect” on wholesale prices withstands field 
preemption, but not conflict preemption. 

                                           21 
Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 516 (“[R]egulating producers in such a way as to 
have some impact on the purchasing decisions and hence costs of interstate 
pipelines does not without more result in conflict pre‐emption.”). 
        
       Faced with this precedent, Plaintiffs concede New York’s authority to 
enact “measures that may have an indirect effect on . . . price signals,” but insist 
that “New York cannot directly distort the price signals that the auctions send by 
setting a higher, state‐approved rate for wholesale electricity sales.”  Br. of 
Appellants 49.  To the extent the ZEC program distorts an efficient wholesale 
market, it does so by increasing revenues for qualifying nuclear plants, which in 
turn increases the supply of electricity, which in turn lowers auction clearing 
prices.  But that is (at best) an incidental effect resulting from New York’s 
regulation of producers.  In any event, ZECs do not guarantee a certain 
wholesale price that displaces the NYISO auction price.   
        
       FERC uses auctions to set wholesale prices and to promote efficiency with 
the background assumption that the FPA establishes a dual regulatory system 
between the states and federal government and that the states engage in public 
policies that affect the wholesale markets.  Accordingly, the ZEC program does 
not cause clear damage to federal goals, and Plaintiffs have failed to state a 
plausible claim for conflict preemption. 
        
                                           VII 
 
       The Commerce Clause authorizes Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce . . . 
among the several States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  “[T]he Clause was 
designed in part to prevent trade barriers that had undermined efforts of the 
fledgling States to form a cohesive whole following their victory in the 
Revolution.”  Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 807 (1976).  
Accordingly, the Supreme Court has inferred a “negative or dormant 
implication” to the Commerce Clause, which “prohibits state taxation or 
regulation that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and 
thereby impedes free private trade in the national marketplace.”  Gen. Motors 
Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).   
        
       However, the states retain “a residuum of power . . . to make laws 



                                         22 
governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect 
interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.”  Kassel v. Consol. 
Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U.S. 662, 669 (1981) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  Accordingly, a state law or regulation offends the dormant Commerce 
Clause only if it “(1) clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of 
intrastate commerce, (2) imposes a burden on interstate commerce 
incommensurate with the local benefits secured, or (3) has the practical effect of 
extraterritorial control of commerce occurring entirely outside the boundaries of 
the state in question.”  Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth. 584 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir. 
2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
        
       Plaintiffs contend that the ZEC program violates the dormant Commerce 
Clause under the first two grounds: the program discriminates against interstate 
commerce by “deliberately propping up the in‐state Exelon plants via a 
distortion of the interstate energy market,” Br. of Appellants 52, and inflicts an 
undue burden on interstate commerce that outweighs any local interests by 
“impos[ing] market‐distorting burdens that will drive out, and deter entry of, 
more cost‐efficient, environmentally friendly out‐of‐state generators,” id. at 53.  
We do not reach the merits of these claims because we conclude that Plaintiffs 
lack Article III standing. 
        
       The jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited to “Cases” and 
“Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  There is no case or controversy unless a 
plaintiff has standing to challenge the defendant’s conduct.  Lujan v. Defenders 
of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  Although the district court did not address 
whether Plaintiffs have standing on their dormant Commerce Clause claim, 
“[t]he doctrine of standing . . . requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that 
the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy 
as to warrant his invocation of federal‐court jurisdiction.”  Summers v. Earth 
Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
        
       Article III standing requires a plaintiff to have suffered an “injury in fact” 
that is “fairly traceable” to the defendant’s challenged conduct and that is “likely 
to be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 
138 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  At the pleading stage, “the plaintiff must clearly allege facts 
demonstrating each element.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and ellipsis 



                                          23 
omitted).  Accordingly, to show standing for their dormant Commerce Clause 
claim, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that their alleged injuries are traceable to (i.e., 
“the result of,” City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983), or “a 
consequence of,” Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation 
of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 485 (1982)) discrimination against interstate 
commerce. 
        
       Plaintiffs allege that they are injured because the ZEC program allows 
“favored New York power plants to prevail in interstate competition against 
Plaintiffs” by underbidding them in the wholesale electricity markets.  Br. of 
Appellants 49.  Plaintiffs do not represent that they own any nuclear plants, in‐
state or out.  Special App’x 40.  If the PSC awarded ZECs in a non‐discriminatory 
manner to out‐of‐state nuclear plants (as it may do in the future under the terms 
of the CES Order), there would be no abatement in the injury Plaintiffs claim to 
suffer from the general market‐distorting effects of the ZEC program.  In short, 
Plaintiffs’ injuries “would continue to exist even if the [legislation] were cured” 
of the alleged discrimination.  Johnson v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 
783 F.3d 655, 662 (7th Cir. 2015).  Because Plaintiffs’ asserted injuries are not traceable to the 
alleged discrimination against out‐of‐state entities, but (rather) arises from their 
production of energy using fuels that New York disfavors, they lack Article III 
standing to challenge the ZEC program. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
       The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

""5. The program does not guarantee wholesale prices or displace federally regulated auction rates, and any effects on wholesale prices are incidental."",
""6. The ZEC program regulates production, which falls within state jurisdiction, and similar state-created energy credits have been recognized as outside federal jurisdiction when unbundled from wholesale sales."",
""7. Because the program regulates production and does not directly control wholesale market participation, plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim for field preemption."",
""8. Conflict preemption requires a showing that state law causes clear damage to federal objectives, and incidental effects on wholesale prices resulting from state regulation of production do not satisfy that standard."",

           EXPEDITED HEARING ORDER DENYING REQUESTED RELIEF
        Dionnie Walker alleged that her work for the Clarksville Department of Electricity
resulted in injuries to both shoulders. She seeks medical benefits for her left shoulder and
temporary disability benefits. The Department of Electricity counters that the statute of
limitations bars her left-shoulder claim, and no doctor has related that particular injury to
work.
        After a December 9, 2021 expedited hearing, the Court holds that the statute of
limitations has not run on her claim, but at this time, the medical proof does not support
that Ms. Walker’s left-shoulder condition is work-related. Therefore, the Court must deny
her requested relief.
                                            Claim History
       Ms. Walker injured her right shoulder while working for the Department of
Electricity on October 10, 2018. The Department of Electricity accepted the claim and
authorized treatment with Dr. Keith Starkweather. He performed surgery in late January
2019.1
1
 The medical proof contains a letter from the adjuster to Dr. Starkweather regarding whether Ms. Walker’s
post-surgery blood clots relate to work; he checked “no.” Ms. Walker’s mother testified, without
contradiction, that the nurse case manager presented this letter to the doctor at a visit. On this testimony
alone, it is unclear whether the nurse case manager’s conduct violated the Bureau’s rules, so the Court will
not refer the case to the Compliance Program for the potential imposition of penalties. However, the Court
cautions that a case manager “is prohibited from engaging in any activity that places him or her in an
                                                     1
        Before the surgery, Dr. Starkweather placed Ms. Walker on modified duty. She
testified that the Department of Electricity refused to accommodate her restriction, and she
had to continue her regular duties using her left arm exclusively. The Department of
Electricity offered no proof that it accommodated her restrictions.
        According to Ms. Walker, this led to overuse of the left arm. Ms. Walker’s mother
and son confirmed that, after the surgery, she had difficulty performing her daily living
activities because both arms appeared to be causing her significant pain.
       The medical records confirm that Ms. Walker discussed her left-shoulder pain with
Dr. Starkweather’s physician assistant. The February 4, 2019 notes state she was there “for
pain in her left shoulder. Her shoulder pain began a few weeks ago that has been worsening
over the past week. She is unable to lift things with the left arm.” The physician assistant
assessed “pain in left shoulder” and “tendinitis of left rotator cuff.” She injected the
shoulder. Notes from a return visit on February 18 state that Ms. Walker was there: “for
pain in her left shoulder rotator cuff tendinitis. She complains of pain since October.”
        The physician assistant ordered an MRI for the left shoulder, which never took
place. Ms. Walker testified that both her personal insurance and the workers’
compensation carrier declined to cover it, and she was unable to afford it on her own. The
workers’ compensation claims adjuster, Ruth Cromer, testified that she did not authorize
the left-shoulder MRI because she did not see a statement in the records relating it to work.2
Dr. Starkweather provided no more treatment for the left shoulder.
       Dr. Starkweather placed Ms. Walker at maximum medical improvement on July 9,
placed permanent restrictions, and assigned an impairment rating for the right shoulder.
The carrier stopped paying temporary disability benefits in June, according to Ms. Walker.
She testified without contradiction that the Department of Electricity did not offer her any
position afterward. She applied for and received unemployment insurance benefits in
March 2020. Ms. Walker said that she does not know when her termination actually
occurred—July 2019 or March 2020. The Department of Electricity offered no evidence
on this question.
       No other notes from the authorized doctor were admitted into evidence; however,
additional treatment records documented Ms. Walker’s bilateral shoulder problems. These
adversarial role to either the employee or the employer.” Philalom v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,
2021 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 34, at *17 (Oct. 8, 2021).
2
  The Department of Electricity did not disclose an intention to call Ms. Cromer as a witnesses, but Ms.
Walker did not object, so the Court permitted her testimony. The Court notes that Tennessee Compilation
Rules and Regulations 0800-02-21-.15(1)(a) states in relevant part that “[t]he party opposing the request
for expedited hearing must . . . provide a plain, concise statement detailing why the relief requested should
not be granted and listing any witnesses it intends to call at the expedited hearing.”
                                                     2
include an October 2019 MRI report of the right shoulder ordered by Dr. Starkweather. It
shows, in part, a “complete tear of the intra-articular biceps tendon with distal retraction
and blunting of the superior labral biceps anchor, chronic.” Likewise, an unauthorized
April 2021 right-shoulder MRI showed a “chronic tear long head of the biceps tendon” and
a “type II SLAP tear.” Ms. Walker underwent an MRI ̶ also unauthorized ̶ of her left
shoulder in June, which showed a type II SLAP tear and a “partial tear of the long head of
the biceps tendon.” Afterward, a doctor diagnosed right and left shoulder tears and outlined
several potential treatments, including the possibility of surgery for the left shoulder.
      Ms. Walker has since moved to New York state. She filed her petition for benefit
determination on May 13, 2021, listing the injured body part as her “right shoulder.”
       The Department of Electricity paid the last medical bill on June 5, 2020.
                        Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
       At an expedited hearing, Ms. Walker must provide sufficient evidence from which
the Court can determine she is likely to prevail at a hearing on the merits. McCord v.
Advantage Human Resourcing, 2015 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 6, at *7-8, 9 (Mar.
27, 2015).
        The threshold issue in this case is the Department of Electricity’s statute of
limitations defense. Under the Workers’ Compensation Law, in cases where the employer
has voluntarily paid benefits to or on behalf of the employee, the employee’s right to
recover compensation is forever barred unless she files a petition for benefit determination
within one year after the time the employer ceased to make payments of compensation to
or on behalf of the employee. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-203(b)(2) (2021).
        Here, the unrefuted evidence shows that Ms. Walker filed her claim within the above
limitations period. The last payment was on June 4, 2020; the petition was filed within a
year on May 13, 2021.
        The Department of Electricity argued that the statute ran on the left-shoulder claim.
It pointed out that her petition for benefit determination lists an injury to her right shoulder
only.
       The Court rejects this argument. The Department of Electricity cited no authority
for the proposition that, in cases where an employee claims injury to multiple body parts,
all must be pleaded contemporaneously for purposes of the statute of limitations. In fact,
persuasive case law suggests the opposite. See Norfleet v. J. W. Goad Constr., No. M2001-
00425-WC-R3-CV, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 811, at *6 (Tenn. Workers’ Comp. Panel Dec. 3,
2001) (Where employer argued the claims for additional conditions were not timely
because they were not included in the original complaint, but were added by amendment,
                                               3
which the employer asserted was not filed until after the statute of limitations had run, the
original complaint in the case was “sufficient” because the employer cited no rule requiring
a workers’ compensation claimant to specify his injuries in the complaint).
       Having denied this defense, the Court turns to whether Ms. Walker satisfied her
burden to show that she is entitled to additional treatment for her left shoulder.
Specifically, she must show that her left-shoulder condition is an injury “arising primarily
out of and in the course and scope of employment” that causes the need for medical
treatment. It must be shown to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the
employment contributed more than fifty percent in causing the injury, considering all
causes. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-102(14)(A)-(C). In addition:
        [A] subsequent injury, whether in the form of an aggravation of the original
        injury or a new and distinct injury, is compensable if it is the “direct and
        natural result” of a compensable injury. . . . [W]hen the primary injury is
        shown to have arisen out of and in the course of employment, every natural
        consequence that flows from the injury likewise arises out of the
        employment. Consequently, all the medical consequences and sequelae that
        flow from the primary injury are compensable.
UPS v. Brown, No. M2014-01332-SC-R3-WC, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 628, at *7-8 (Citations
omitted) (Aug. 11, 2015).
       Here, the Department of Electricity did not contest that the right-shoulder injury
arose primarily from employment.3 Rather, it argued that the medical records contain no
statements connecting the left-shoulder condition to work. The Court agrees.
       On February 4, Dr. Starkweather’s physician assistant treated Ms. Walker’s left-
shoulder pain, which “began a few weeks ago” and was worsening, with an injection. On
February 18, the notes state that Ms. Walker was there “for pain in her left shoulder rotator
cuff tendinitis. She complains of pain since October.” These notations support Ms.
Walker’s testimony regarding the timing of the onset of her left-shoulder pain.
       However, these statements do not say that the left-shoulder condition arose
primarily out of and in the course and scope of employment, causing the need for medical
treatment, and that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the employment
contributed more than fifty percent in causing the injury, considering all causes. The
physician assistant also gave no opinion as to whether the left-shoulder pain was the “direct
and natural result” of the right-shoulder injury. Likewise, the June 2021 MRI results show
3
  The Department of Electricity’s counsel stated that it made a settlement offer for the right shoulder that
remains in place, if Ms. Walker chooses to accept it. Further, the dispute certification notice lists only the
left shoulder as “disputed.” Therefore, it appears that the Department of Electricity remains willing to
provide treatment for Ms. Walker’s right shoulder.
                                                      4
tearing in the left shoulder, and a medical doctor discussed the tears with her, but the notes
do not show that he linked her left shoulder condition to her work. Simply put, the records
are silent on the cause of her left-shoulder pain.
       The Court finds Ms. Walker’s testimony wholly credible. She testified, and the
Court finds, that the Department of Electricity did not accommodate her restrictions in the
months following her right shoulder injury. She posited that complete reliance on her left
arm resulted in “overuse” and injury. The Court finds this entirely plausible.
       However, the Appeals Board has held, “It is well-settled that the employee in a
workers’ compensation claim has the burden of proof on all essential elements of the
claim.” Lurz v. Int’l Paper Co., 2018 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 8, at *14 (Feb. 14,
2018). Ms. Walker needs medical proof to support her argument. The record before this
Court at this time does not contain this evidence. Per the Appeals Board, “[J]udges are not
well-suited to make independent medical determinations without expert medical testimony
supporting such a determination. Likewise, parties . . . cannot rely solely on their own
medical interpretations of the evidence to successfully support their arguments.” Id. at *18(Citation omitted).
        Therefore, the Court holds that Ms. Walker has not satisfied her burden to show that
she is likely to prove her left-shoulder condition arose primarily out of her employment.
Nothing in this order precludes Ms. Walker from seeking that evidence and requesting
another expedited hearing.
        Finally, Ms. Walker seeks temporary disability benefits. An injured worker is
eligible for temporary disability benefits if: (1) the worker became disabled from working
due to a compensable injury; (2) there is a causal connection between the injury and the
inability to work; and (3) the worker established the duration of the period of disability.
Jones v. Crencor Leasing and Sales, 2015 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 48, at *7 (Dec.
11, 2015).
       Here, since the Court was unable to hold that Ms. Walker’s left-shoulder condition
arose primarily from work, it cannot find that she is likely to prove she became disabled
from working due to a compensable injury. The Court cannot hold that she is entitled to
these benefits at this time.
IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AS FOLLOWS:
   1. Ms. Walker’s requested relief is denied at this time.
   2. This case is set for a status hearing on February 7, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. Central
   Time. Please call (615) 532-9552 or (866) 943-0025. Failure to appear may result in
   a determination of the issues without your participation.

                           Expedited Hearing Order Right to Appeal:
     If you disagree with this Expedited Hearing Order, you may appeal to the Workers’
Compensation Appeals Board. To appeal an expedited hearing order, you must:
   1. Complete the enclosed form entitled: “Notice of Appeal,” and file the form with the
      Clerk of the Court of Workers’ Compensation Claims within seven business days of the
      date the expedited hearing order was filed. When filing the Notice of Appeal, you must
      serve a copy upon all parties.
   2. You must pay, via check, money order, or credit card, a $75.00 filing fee within ten
      calendar days after filing of the Notice of Appeal. Payments can be made in-person at
      any Bureau office or by U.S. mail, hand-delivery, or other delivery service. In the
      alternative, you may file an Affidavit of Indigency (form available on the Bureau’s
      website or any Bureau office) seeking a waiver of the fee. You must file the fully-
      completed Affidavit of Indigency within ten calendar days of filing the Notice of
      Appeal. Failure to timely pay the filing fee or file the Affidavit of Indigency will
      result in dismissal of the appeal.
   3. You bear the responsibility of ensuring a complete record on appeal. You may request
      from the court clerk the audio recording of the hearing for a $25.00 fee. If a transcript of
      the proceedings is to be filed, a licensed court reporter must prepare the transcript and file
      it with the court clerk within ten business days of the filing the Notice of
      Appeal. Alternatively, you may file a statement of the evidence prepared jointly by both
      parties within ten business days of the filing of the Notice of Appeal. The statement of
      the evidence must convey a complete and accurate account of the hearing. The Workers’
      Compensation Judge must approve the statement before the record is submitted to the
      Appeals Board. If the Appeals Board is called upon to review testimony or other proof
      concerning factual matters, the absence of a transcript or statement of the evidence can be
      a significant obstacle to meaningful appellate review.
   4. If you wish to file a position statement, you must file it with the court clerk within ten
      business days after the deadline to file a transcript or statement of the evidence. The
      party opposing the appeal may file a response with the court clerk within ten business
      days after you file your position statement. All position statements should include: (1) a
      statement summarizing the facts of the case from the evidence admitted during the
      expedited hearing; (2) a statement summarizing the disposition of the case as a result of
      the expedited hearing; (3) a statement of the issue(s) presented for review; and (4) an
      argument, citing appropriate statutes, case law, or other authority.

ZURICH AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY, Plaintiff, Appellant,
v.
ELECTRICITY MAINE, LLC ; Emile Clavet; Kevin Dean; Spark HoldCo, LLC ; Provider Power, LLC ; Katherine Veileux and Jennifer Chon, individually and behalf of all other similarly situated parties, Defendants, Appellees.No. 18-1968United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.June 17, 2019John S. Whitman, Esq., with whom Richardson, Whitman, Large, & Badger, Portland, ME, were on brief for appellant.Timothy E. Steigelman, with whom Melissa A. Hewey, and Drummond Woodsum, Portland, ME, were on brief for appellees.Before Howard, Chief Judge, Boudin and Barron, Circuit Judges.
Combined Opinion by Barron

BARRON, Circuit Judge.
Electricity Maine LLC is a private energy company that serves customers in Maine. It held a D&O insurance policy (the ""Policy"") with Zurich American Insurance Co. (""Zurich"") when, in November of 2015, a class action was brought against it, Spark HoldCo LLC, Emile Clavet, and Kevin Dean (together ""Electricity Maine""). The named plaintiffs were two of Electricity Maine's customers, Jennifer Chon and Katherine Veilleux. They sought to represent a class of nearly 200,000 of the company's customers. The complaint alleged that Electricity Maine had engaged in misconduct that resulted in customers receiving higher bills than Electricity Maine had represented that they would be. The complaint sought class-wide damages totaling approximately $ 35 million for a variety of Maine state common law claims, as well as for claims under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962 , 1964 ; and the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5 § 207.
*35 Electricity Maine tendered notice of the suit to Zurich. Zurich then initiated the present action against Electricity Maine in the United States District Court for the District of Maine on May 3, 2017, based on diversity jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1332 . Zurich seeks a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend Electricity Maine against the underlying action. Zurich contends that Electricity Maine's policy 1 with Zurich provides, in relevant part, that Zurich has a duty to defend Electricity Maine against any lawsuit that seeks damages for ""bodily injury"" caused by an ""occurrence"" and that the complaint in the underlying action fails to allege that Electricity Maine engaged in conduct that qualifies as an ""occurrence"" or that caused any ""bodily injury.""
Zurich and Electricity Maine cross-moved for summary judgment on a stipulated record. The District Court ruled for Electricity Maine. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Electricity Maine LLC , 325 F. Supp. 3d 198 , 202-03 (D. Me. 2018). This appeal followed. We affirm.
I.
We review the District Court's decisions on the parties' motions for summary judgment de novo. See Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Herbert H. Landy Ins. Agency, Inc. , 820 F.3d 36 , 41 (1st Cir. 2016). We must affirm the judgments below if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and the District Court's conclusions are correct as a matter of law. See id.
The parties agree that the only issues presented on appeal concern the District Court's interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Policy. Those issues present matters of law, which we review de novo. Massamont Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co. , 489 F.3d 71 , 72 (1st Cir. 2007).
The parties agree that Maine law controls the interpretive questions at issue on appeal. Under Maine law, ""[i]f the allegations in the underlying ... action are within the risk insured against and there is any potential basis for recovery, the insurer must defend the insured regardless of the actual facts on which the insured's ultimate liability may be based."" Elliott v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 711 A.2d 1310 , 1312 (Me. 1998).
To determine if the allegations in the underlying action are within the risk insured, we must ""compar[e] the complaint with the terms of the insurance contract."" Id. The key terms in the Policy that define the ""risk insured"" are ""occurrence"" and ""bodily injury.""
II.
The Policy defines an ""occurrence"" to be ""an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions."" The Policy does not define what constitutes an ""accident,"" but the Maine Law Court (the ""Law Court"") has explained that an ""accident"" is ""commonly understood to mean ... an event that takes place without one's forethought or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event."" Kelley v. N.E. Ins. Co. , 168 A.3d 779 , 782 (Me. 2017) (quoting Patrick v. J.B. Ham Co. , 119 Me. 510 , 111 A. 912 , 915 (1921) ).
The complaint in the underlying action sets forth a number of claims for intentional torts, but also includes a claim *36 for ""negligence"" and a claim for ""negligent misrepresentation."" The negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims would appear to seek recovery for the kind of conduct that fits comfortably within the definition of an ""accident,"" as these claims require proof only of ""event[s] that take[ ] place without one's forethought or expectation."" Kelley , 168 A.3d at 782 . Indeed, the Law Court has held multiple times that ""broad conclusory allegations of 'negligence,' "" pled in the alternative to claims that require proof of intentional misconduct, constitute allegations of ""accidental"" or ""[un]intentional"" activity that suffice to trigger the duty to defend under policies that cover ""accidents."" Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell , 414 A.2d 220 , 225-27 (Me. 1980) (finding a duty to defend for an ""accident[ ]"" where the complaint alleged negligent acts in the alternative to intentional conduct); Lavoie v. Dorchester Mut. Fire Ins. Co. , 560 A.2d 570 , 571 (Me. 1989) (finding a duty to defend under a policy with an exclusion for ""intentional"" acts where a complaint alleged negligence as an alternative to its intentional assault and battery claims).
To blunt the force of this precedent, Zurich relies on two Law Court cases- Allocca v. York Ins. Co. of Maine , 169 A.3d 938 (Me. 2017) and Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ben-Ami , 193 A.3d 178 (Me. 2018) -that were decided after Travelers and Lavoie . But, neither Allocca nor Ben-Ami involved complaints that, like the complaint at issue here, expressly allege claims for negligence (or negligent misrepresentation) alongside claims for intentional torts. Allocca , 169 A.3d at 940-41 ; Ben-Ami , 193 A.3d at 180-81 .
Zurich also attempts to distinguish Travelers and Lavoie from the present case on the ground that, unlike in those cases, the facts alleged in the complaint here ""make it impossible to sustain the fiction that Electricity Maine was 'negligent' and expected no harm to befall its customers."" Zurich is right that the portion of the complaint that sets forth the RICO claims, alleges that Electricity Maine promised its customers rates that were lower than those offered by the public utilities, raised those rates unexpectedly after the first year of the customers' contracts, notified its customers about the rate increases through emails that were sent to the customers' spam folders, and required that customers pay a $ 100 fee if they wanted to leave these more expensive contracts. And, Zurich is also right that this portion of the complaint does allege that the company engaged in that conduct intentionally, just as one would expect, given that RICO claims seek recovery for intentional torts.
But we do not see why, when the complaint goes on to incorporate by reference the same factual allegations into its claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation, it must be read to be alleging, with respect to those claims, that Electricity Maine acted intentionally rather than inadvertently. Those claims, unlike the RICO claims, do not require proof of intentional conduct. We note, moreover, that this conclusion accords with Harlor v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co , 150 A.3d 793 (Me. 2016). There, the Law Court explained that the duty to defend is triggered so long as a complaint ""reveals ... any legal or factual basis that could potentially be developed at trial"" for proving conduct that would fall within the risk insured. Id. at 797 (emphasis added). And, as we explained in Auto Europe, LLC v. Conn. Indem. Co. , after canvassing Maine law, the duty to defend is triggered under the state's law ""where a narrow reading of the complaint's factual allegations might preclude coverage, but the alleged cause of action is sufficiently broad that a modified version of the facts could *37 be developed at trial to show liability."" 321 F.3d 60 , 68 (1st Cir. 2003).
That is not to say that either the negligent misrepresentation claim or the negligence claim has merit. But, even a ""broad, conclusory allegation, such as negligence"" that is ""legally insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss"" will trigger an insurer's duty to defend ""whenever the allegations show a potential that liability will be established within the insurance coverage."" Travelers , 414 A.2d at 226 .
Zurich does point to precedents in which various courts, including our own, have, in construing Maine law, concluded that a particular complaint in an underlying suit failed to set forth factual allegations of a type that could trigger an insurer's duty to defend its insured against claims that had been set forth in that complaint. See Lyman Morse Boatbuilding, Inc. v. N. Assurance Co. of Am. , 772 F.3d 960 , 966 (1st Cir. 2014) ; Prime Tanning Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. , 750 F. Supp. 2d 198 , 214-15 (D. Me. 2010) ; Baywood Corp. v. Me. Bonding & Casualty Co. , 628 A.2d 1029 , 1031 (Me. 1993) ; A. Johnson & Co., Inc. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. , 933 F.2d 66 , 75 (1st Cir. 1991). But, none of the complaints in those cases pled claims for both intentional and unintentional torts and incorporated by reference facts that pertained to the former to support the latter in the way that the complaint at issue here does. Thus, none of those precedents undermines our conclusion that this complaint is fairly read to set forth-at least in a ""broad, conclusory"" fashion, Travelers , 414 A.2d at 226 -factual allegations of negligent conduct by Electricity Maine. Accordingly, none of those precedents supplies a basis for concluding that this complaint fails to allege facts that fall within the risk insured by the Policy, at least insofar as that risk is defined by the Policy's definition of an ""occurrence."" Id .
III.
Zurich separately contends that the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" does not encompass the allegations of misconduct by Electricity Maine contained in the complaint at issue. Thus, the company contends, for this reason as well, that the complaint fails to contain factual allegations that fall within the risk insured.
Electricity Maine acknowledges that the complaint does not allege that its conduct caused ""bodily injury."" The company contends, however, that Harlor makes clear that the complaint need not do so to trigger Zurich's duty to defend. We agree.
In Harlor , as in this case, the underlying complaint did not allege ""bodily injury."" Harlor , 150 A.3d at 800 . Nevertheless, the Law Court held that the insurer in that case had a duty to defend under the policy at issue, because the tortious conduct alleged in the complaint in the underlying action ""could have resulted in ... bodily harm due to emotional distress."" Id. ; see also York Ins. Grp. of Me. v. Lambert , 740 A.2d 984 , 985-86 (Me. 1999) (holding the same). Moreover, Harlor reached that conclusion even though the complaint in that underlying action did not expressly allege ""emotional distress."" Harlor , 150 A.3d at 800 .
Zurich contends that the Policy expressly defines ""bodily injury"" to encompass ""mental injury, shock, [or] fright ... resulting from bodily injury ...."" (Emphasis added). Zurich then goes on to argue that, in consequence, the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" is best read, impliedly, to exclude from its scope ""bodily injury"" that is caused by emotional distress. And, Zurich contends, this definition of ""bodily injury"" differs from the definition of ""bodily injury"" used in the policy that was at issue *38 in either Harlor or York , such that neither precedent supports Electricity Maine's position here.
But, while the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" states that it "" includes "" ""mental injury, shock, [or] fright resulting from bodily injury,"" (emphasis added), the definition does not state that it excludes coverage for ""bodily injury"" caused by those markers of emotional distress. Thus, because Maine law requires us to construe ambiguous policy language in favor of the insured, we reject Zurich's restrictive construction of the Policy. See Foremost Ins. Co. v. Levesque , 868 A.2d 244 , 246 (Me. 2005) (""Any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be resolved against the insurer and in favor of coverage."").
Zurich has one last argument for why, Harlor notwithstanding, the inclusion of the negligent misrepresentation and negligence claims provides no basis for concluding that the complaint sets forth factual allegations that fall within the ""risk insured,"" at least insofar as the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" establishes the risk that Zurich has agreed to insure. Zurich points out that a claim for ""negligent misrepresentation"" cannot give rise to damages for emotional distress under Maine law, see Veilleux v. National Broadcasting Co. , 206 F.3d 92 , 130 (1st Cir. 2000), and thus that the negligent misrepresentation claim here cannot be treated as one that seeks damages-even potentially-for bodily injury that arises from such emotional distress. Zurich further contends that the putatively stand-alone negligence claim is in fact just a mirror of the claim that Electricity Maine committed the tort of negligent misrepresentation. Accordingly, Zurich argues that, even though damages for emotional distress often may be recovered for a negligence claim, see Curran v. Richardson , 448 F. Supp. 2d 228 , 231 (D. Me. 2006) (citing Curtis v. Porter , 784 A.2d 18 , 27 (Me. 2001) ), the negligence claim that is set forth in the complaint at issue here cannot.
But, Zurich's argument overlooks the fact that the Law Court has, in construing Maine law, held that claims involving negligent omissions for which there was no statutory duty to disclose were not negligent misrepresentation claims, but were, instead, more appropriately characterized as pure negligence claims. See Binette v. Dyer Library Ass'n , 688 A.2d 898 , 905-06 (Me. 1996). Here, the face of the complaint is fairly read to permit the conclusion that the negligence claim includes allegations of negligent omissions of just that sort. The complaint alleges that Electricity Maine failed to notify its customers that their contracts would ""automatically renew"" at higher rates and, similarly, failed to notify its customers that they would face a $ 100 termination fee if they attempted to leave their contracts. Thus, in accord with Auto Europe , we conclude that, even though ""a narrow reading of the complaint's factual allegations might preclude coverage ... the alleged cause of action is sufficiently broad that a modified version of the facts could be developed at trial to show liability."" 321 F.3d at 68 .
Zurich does make the sweeping contention in its reply brief that emotional distress damages under Maine law may be recovered in negligence claims only for conduct that resulted in physical injuries, presumably to support the contention that damages may not be recovered in such claims for physical injuries that result from emotional distress. But, aside from the fact that arguments that are made for the first time in reply briefs are waived, see United States v. Torres , 162 F.3d 6 , 11 (1st Cir. 1998), Zurich does not cite to any precedent that supports its broad assertion about the limited circumstances in which damages for emotional distress may be *39 recovered for the tort of negligence in Maine. Nor does Zurich address the fact that the Law Court stated in Curtis that ""most tort actions"" can give rise to recovery for emotional distress. Curtis , 784 A.2d at 26 . Thus, we treat as waived for lack of development any argument that a negligence claim for an omission such as was alleged to have occurred here cannot give rise to emotional distress damages under Maine law. See United States v. Zannino , 895 F.2d 1 , 17 (1st Cir. 1990).
None of this is to deny that one might doubt whether, in the context of this case, the alleged negligence is of a type that could cause distress that would result in bodily injury. But, the Law Court has made clear that, for purposes of Maine insurance law, where ""general allegations for the particular claims asserted in the underlying complaint ... could potentially support an award of covered damages for bodily injury caused by emotional distress,"" the duty to defend exists. Harlor , 150 A.3d at 799 (emphasis added).
IV.
For the foregoing reasons we affirm the District Court's decisions granting summary judgment in favor of Electricity Maine and denying the appellants' Motion for Summary Judgment. The parties shall bear their own costs.
 1
The terms of the Policy were set forth in three successive contracts. The parties agree that the relevant language is identical from one contract to the next, and, therefore, should be treated as one policy.

MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER
VALERIE:CAPRQNI, United States District Judge:
Some say that human-caused global warming is a “hoax,”1 while others accept the overwhelming scientific conclusion that human activities, and particularly carbon dioxide discharges into the atmosphere, are causing the planet to warm. Although no individual State can reverse the trend all by itself, New York and many other States have decided that they will do their part to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming. The issue in this case is whether the method New York has chosen to facilitate its doing so is constitutional. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the New York program is constitutional,
Plaintiffs are various electrical generators and trade groups of electrical generators. They challenge one aspect of the Clean Energy Standard (“CES”) Order, adopted by the New York Public Service Commission (“PSC”), that awards credits to certain nuclear generators for their zero-emissions electricity production. Plaintiffs .claim that this program is preempted under the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause.
Defendants, who are PSC members, move to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that there is no private right of action for Plaintiffs’ preemption' claims and that, even if there were, Plaintiffs’ claims would fail as a matter of law. Notice of Defendants’ Motion to' Dismiss, Dkt. 54. Intervenors, who are the nuclear generators receiving the zero-emissions credits and their owners, also move to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Notice of Motion, Dkt. 76. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS both motions to dismiss.
BACKGROUND2
The Electricity Market
• In- New 'York, wholesale electricity is bought and sold through market-based *560auctions administered by the New York Independent System Operator (“NYISO”). Compl. ¶ 28. The NYISO, which is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), conducts two types of auctions: energy and capacity. Compl. ¶¶ 28-29. Energy auctions are for the purchase and sale of electricity itself, whereas capacity auctions are for the purchase and sale of options to purchase electricity. Compl. ¶36. Retail electricity suppliers, also called load-serving entities (“LSEs”), purchase electricity at wholesale from generators in these auctions. Compl. ¶ 35. Although some of the buyers are located outside New York, most of the buyers are in-state utilities that resell energy at retail to New York customers and businesses. Compl. ¶28. The energy suppliers in the wholesale auction include generators located inside and outside of New York. Compl. ¶ 28.
The NYISO auctions determine electricity prices in the New York wholesale market. Compl. ¶ 27. The auction operates by “stacking” bids from generators for the sale of energy or capacity, beginning with the lowest bid and moving up until demand is satisfied. Compl. ¶¶ 32-33. The price of the highest-stacked bid that satisfies demand is known as the “market clearing price.” Compl. ¶33. Any generator that bids at or below the market-clearing price “clears” the auction and is paid the market-clearing price, regardless of the price the generator actually bid.3 Compl. ¶¶ 33, 39. This pricing mechanism incentivizes generators to be efficient and cost-effective: “it creates price signals for new capacity to enter the market if [the generator] can supply capacity at prices below the clearing price. At the same time, the market provides price signals for existing suppliers to exit the market if they are unable to beat the clearing price.” Compl. ¶ 40 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Nuclear generators, such as Interve-nors, bid as so-called “price-takers” in the NYISO auctions, meaning that they sell their entire output at the market-clearing price. Compl. ¶34. Unlike other types of electricity generators that can adjust their output to produce more or less energy depending on price, nuclear generators run continuously at maximum output. Compl. ¶ 34. Nuclear generators thus sell their entire electricity output into the auctions regardless of the price — even if the price is below their cost of production. Compl. ¶ 34.
Plaintiffs allege that the nuclear generators’ price-taking behavior depresses market-clearing prices because the nuclear generators increase the energy supply available at auction. Compl. ¶ 34. Plaintiffs further allege that all electricity produced by these nuclear generators must be sold in the NYISO energy auctions because they have no alternative way to sell their output. Compl, ¶¶ 34, 64.
New York’s ZEC Program
In order to promote the development of clean energy as part of New York’s effort to stanch global warning, the PSC issued the CES Order. CES Order, Dkt. 76-1. *561The CES Order created two programs: Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) and Zero-Emission Credits (“ZECs”). CES Order at 13-14. The CES Order was adopted in furtherance of New York’s goal to generate fifty percent of its electricity using renewable"" sources by 2030, which supports New York’s broader mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide by forty percent by 2030. CES Order at 2,12.
Tier 1 of the CES Order, which implements the REC program, requires all New York LSEs “to serve their retail customers by procuring new renewable' resources.” CES Order at 14; see also Compl. ¶ 49. Generators that produce energy from renewable sources, like wind or solar, are awarded a credit (a REC) for each megawatt-hour (“MWh”) of renewable-generated electricity produced from renewable resources. Compl. ¶ 49; CES Order at 106. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (“NYSERDA”) purchases RECs from generators, thereby subsidizing their cost of production, and, in turn, sells those RECs to LSEs. CES Order at 16, 107-08. Each LSE is required to purchase RECs in an amount based on a percentage of the total load served by that LSE or make an alternative compliance payment. Compl. ¶ 49; CES Order at 14-16. The cost of the RECs is passed on to commodity custom^ ers. CES Order at 17.
Tier 3 of the CES Order establishes New York’s ZEC program, the .program challenged in this case. CES Order at 19. A ZEC is a “credit for the zero-emissions attributes of one megawatt-hour of electricity production by” an eligible nuclear facility. CES Order, App’x E,- at 1. Through the ZEC program, New York aims to “encourage the preservation of the environmental values or attributes of zero-emissions nuclear-powered electric generating facilities for the benefit of the electric system, its customers and environment.” CES Order, App’x E, at 1.- In particular, the ZEC program ensures that New York’s nuclear generators — which comprise thirty-one percent of New York’s electric generation mix and collectively avoid the emission of over fifteen million tons of carbon dioxide per year— continue to contribute to New York’s electric generation mix pending the development of new renewable energy resources between now and 2030. CES Order at 19. According to the CES Order, losing the nuclear energy contributed by the generators before new renewable resources are developed “would undoubtedly result in significantly increased air emissions” and a “dangerously higher reliance on natural gas”; without the carbon-free attributes of the nuclear generators, New York would have to rely more heavily on existing fossil-fueled energy plants or the construction of new natural gas plants for its electricity, all of which would significantly increase carbon emissions.4 CES Order at *56219. The CES .Order cites Germany as a case-.in .point:- when Germany abruptly closed its nuclear plants following the Fu-kushima nuclear disaster, the electricity that had formerly been produced by nuclear generation was replaced by electricity generated by coal, causing carbon emissions to rise despite a simultaneous and “aggressive” increase in solar generar tion. CES Order at.19.
A nuclear generator is eligible for ZECs if'it makes'a showing of “public necessity,” i.e., the facility’s revenues “are at & level that is insufficient -to provide adequate compensation to preserve the zero-emission environmental values or attributes historically provided by the facility.” Compl. ¶ 67 (quoting CES Order at 124). Any nuclear generator, regardless of its location, is eligible for ZECs, so long as the- generator has historically contributed to' the resource mix of clean energy consumed by New York retail consumers.5 Compl. ¶ 68 (citing CES Order at 124). Pursuant to the CES Order, the nuclear generators sell their ZECs to NYSERDA at a price administratively determined by the PSC. Compl. ¶ 69. LSEs are required to purchase ZECs from NYSERDA in an amount proportional to their customers’ share of the total energy consumed in New York.6 CES Order at 20,151; Compl. ¶ 73. The LSEs pass the costs of their ZEC purchases. to their customers, the retail ratepayers, CES Order at 20; Compl, ¶ 73.
ZEC prices are calculated by the PSC using the federal estimate of the social cost of carbon and a forecast of wholesale electricity prices.7 Compl. ¶71 (citing CES Order at Í31). Specifically, for a two-year period, the price of each ZEC is'the social cost of carbon less the generator’s putative value of avoided greenhouse gas emissions less the amount of the forecast energy price. Compl, ¶¶ 70-71 (citing CES Order at 13Í). Put differently, if the forecast wholesale price of electricity increases, the price of a ZEC decreases. Compl. ¶ 71. For the first two years of the ZEC program, *563from April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2019, the PSC has set the ZEC price at $17.48 per MWh. Compl. ¶ 70. Thus, “each qualifying nuclear generator will get an additional $17.48 for .each MWh of electricity it generates (subject to a possible cap), in addition to the price.the facility receives for the sale of the electricity and capacity in the [NYSIO] market.” Compl. ¶ 70.
Plaintiffs .allege that under the ZEC program, the nuclear generators eligible for ZECs effectively receive a higher price for their energy than they would have without the ZEC program and that the ZEC subsidies distort the market-clearing price in the NYISO auctions. Compl. ¶¶ 43-45. Plaintiffs allege that because the ZEC program allows the eligible nuclear generators to participate in the NYISO auctions when they otherwise would have gone out of business, New York “is using the ZEC subsidy to exert a large depressive effect on energy and capacity prices, which one group of experts estimated at $15 billion. over 12 years.” Compl, ¶ 47. According to Plaintiffs, this depressive effect will cause generators, including Plaintiffs, to receive a lower price than they otherwise would have received and will cause their bids to fail to clear the auctions when they otherwise would have cleared. Compl. ¶¶ 74, 81, 87.
Plaintiffs claim that the ZEC program is preempted under the FPA and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause. Defendants and Intervenors move to dismiss, arguing that: Plaintiffs lack a private right of action to pursue their preemption claims in federal court; the ZEC program is not preempted; and the ZEC program does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause; For the following reasons, the Court holds that Plaintiffs may not raise their preemption claims pursuant to the Court’s equity jurisdiction; that the ZEC program is neither field nor conflict preempted; and that the ZEC program does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.
DISCUSSION8
In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court accepts all of the non-movant’s factual allegations as true and' draws all reasonable inferences in the non-movant’s favor, See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Although all factual allegations contained in the complaint are assumed to be true, this tenet is “inapplicable to legal conclusions.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the complaint must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id, .
I. EQUITY JURISDICTION
The Supremacy Clause does riot create a cause of action for preemption claims, Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1378, 1383, 191 L.Ed.2d 471 (2015), and Plaintiffs do not argue that the FPA itself creates a private *564right of action. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ preemption claims are dependent on this Court having equity jurisdiction over the claims.
Since Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), “the Supreme Court has consistently recognized federal [equity] jurisdiction over declaratory — and injunctive — relief actions to prohibit the enforcement of state or municipal orders alleged to violate federal law.” Friends of the E. Hampton Airport, Inc. v. Town of E. Hampton, 841 F.3d 133, 144 (2d Cir. 2016) (collecting cases). Nevertheless, federal courts’ “equity [jurisdiction] to enjoin unlawful executive action is subject to express and implied statutory limitations.” Armstrong, 135 S.Ct. at 1385. The FPA does not expressly preclude actions in equity, but the parties contest whether Congress implicitly intended to foreclose equitable relief under the FPA.
In Armstrong, the Supreme Court held that Congress implicitly foreclosed equitable relief under Section 30(A) of the Medicaid Act, which healthcare providers sought to enforce by enjoining state officials from reimbursing medical service providers at rates lower than the federal statute required. 135 S.Ct. at 1382, 1385. The Armstrong Court reasoned that Congress intended to foreclose equitable relief because (1) pursuant to the Medicaid Act, “the sole remedy” for a State’s failure to comply with the Medicaid Act’s requirements was the withholding of Medicaid funds by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and (2) Section 30(A), which mandates that States provide for payments that are “consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care” while “safeguarding] against unnecessary utilization of ... care and services,” was judicially unadministrable. Id. at 1385 (alteration in Armstrong). According to the Supreme Court, the combination of those two features means that Congress intended to preclude private enforcement in equity of Section 30(A). Id. (“Explicitly conferring enforcement of this judgment-laden standard upon the Secretary alone establishes ... that Congress ‘wanted to make the agency remedy that it provided exclusive,’ ....” (quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 292, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002) (Breyer, J., concurring))).
In Friends of the East Hampton Airport, the Second Circuit applied Armstrong’s two criteria to the Airport Noise and Capacity Act (“ANCA”) in considering whether Congress intended to foreclose equitable relief; the Second Circuit held that Congress did not so intend. 841 F.3d at 145-47. Under ANCA, there is no “sole remedy” because ANCA not only provides for the loss of federal funding as a penalty for violating ANCA but also grants the Secretary of Transportation authority to pursue appropriate legal remedies, including injunctive relief. Id. at 145-46 (citing 49 U.S.C. §§ 47526, 47533). The Second Circuit reasoned that “[t]he fact that Congress conferred such broad enforcement authority on the [Federal Aviation Administration], and not on private parties, does not imply its intent to bar such parties from invoking federal jurisdiction where, as here, they do so not to enforce the federal law themselves, but to preclude a municipal entity from subjecting them to local laws enacted in violation of federal requirements.”9 Id. at 146. The Second *565Circuit also held that ANCA was judicially administrable because it set forth a simple rule — namely, that airports seeking to impose noise restrictions on certain types of aircraft must obtain the consent of aircraft operators or the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration. Id. at 146-47 (citing 49 U.S.C. § 47524(c)).
The FPA tacitly forecloses private parties from invoking equity jurisdiction to challenge state laws enacted in alleged violation of the FPA because Congress implicitly provided a “sole remedy” in the FPA — specifically, enforcement by FERC. Similar to ANCA, the FPA grants FERC broad enforcement authority. For example, the FPA grants FERC discretion to bring an action in federal district court to enjoin any person violating the FPA or to enforce compliance. 16 U.S.C. § 825m(a). The FPA also requires every public utility to file with FERC rates'for all sales Subject to FERC’s jurisdiction and empowers FERC to hold hearings to examine new or changed rates, to suspend rates, and to determine rates. 16 U.S.C. §§ 824d(c)-(e), 824e(a). Finally, the FPA authorizes any person to file a complaint with FERC to challenge, inter alia, anything done by a regulated entity in contravention of the FPA. 16 U.S.C. §§ 824e(a), 825e. But, unlike ANCA, Congress provided for a narrow private cause of action under the FPA in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (“PURPA”), which authorizes private parties to challenge’ state rules governing small power production facilities, after first exhausting their administrative remedies. 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3(h)(2)(B). Congress’s decision to create a limited private cause of action suggests that “the omission of a general private right of action in the [FPA] should ... be understood as intentional.” Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, No. 17 CV 1163, 2017 WL 3008289, at *9 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017); see Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 290, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (“The express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that ■ Congress intended to preclude others.”); Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 147, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985) (“[W]here a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted omitted))."" Thus, the FPA precludes private enforcement except as provided for by PURPA, and private parties such as Plaintiffs “cannot, by invoking [the Court’s] equitable powers, circumvent Congress’s exclusion of private enforcement.” Armstrong, 135 S.Ct. at 1385.
The second indicator of congressional intent to preclude equitable relief to a private litigant, according to Armstrong, is the. presence of a judicially unadministra-ble standard. The FPA’s requirement that wholesale electricity rates be just and reasonable, 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a), is not judicially unadministrable.10 The fact that *566courts must “afford great deference” to FERC in its determination of just and reasonable rates, Morgan Stanley Capital Grp. Inc. v. Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., Wash., 554 U.S. 527, 532, 128 S.Ct. 2733, 171 L.Ed.2d 607 (2008), does not mean that the determination of just and reasonable rates is judicially unadministrable — courts - may, defer to' FERC’s determination, but they do not abstain from all judgment regarding.what constitutes a just and reasonable rate, see, e.g., id. at 545-46, 128 S.Ct. 2733 (the Supreme Court in Fed. Power Comm’n v. Sierra Pac. Power Co., 350 U.S. 348, 76 S.Ct. 368, 100 L.Ed. 388 (1956), “provided a definition of what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context”); Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. FERC, 783 F.3d 92, 109-11 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding that FERC’s determination of just and reasonable rates was adequately supported anil not unreasonable); Mont. Consumer Counsel v. FERC, 659 F.3d 910, 918 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The Supreme Court has long held that the statutory command that rates be ‘just and' reasonable’ means that courts must balance ‘the investor and the consumer interests,’ and ‘[i]f the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry ... is at an end.’” (quoting Fed. Power Comm’n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 602-03, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944))). Indeed, by allowing FERC to file federal lawsuits, 16 U.S.C. § 825m(a), Congress necessarily anticipated that courts might have to oversee the enforcement of the just and reasonable rate standard, albeit with deference to FERC.11
In sum, the Court finds that the first but not the second of Armstrong’s factors indicates that Congress intended to preclude equitable relief to private parties. There is no indication in Armstrong that both factors must be satisfied in order to conclude that Congress intended to foreclose equitable- relief to private parties. To the contrary, the Supreme Court in Armstrong considered the second factor — judicial ad-ministrability — in the event the provision authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enforce the statute by withholding funds “might not, by itself, preclude the availability of equitable relief.” 135 S.Ct. at 1385. The limited private right of action provided by PURPA is by itself sufficient to establish that Congress intended to foreclose equitable relief. Between-a statute that establishes a narrow private cause of action allowing private lawsuits in some but hot most cases and a statute that establishes a specific administrative remedy, the former indicates more clearly, than the latter that Congress chose to eliminate general equitable relief for private parties. The issue of creating a private cause of action was squarely before *567Congress when it drafted and enacted the former provision, whereas Congress did not necessarily consider the possibility of a private right of action in drafting and enacting the latter provision. This Court can, therefore, more confidently infer that Congress intended to foreclose a private right of action in equity in the former scenario than in the latter. Accordingly, this Court does not have equity jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ FPA preemption claims. Nevertheless, even if the Plaintiffs could invoke the Court’s equity jurisdiction, for the reasons provided below, Plaintiffs’ preemption claims would fail.
II. PREEMPTION
The Supremacy Clause provides that the laws of the United States “shall be the supreme Law of the Land ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. In other words, “federal law preempts contrary state law.” Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1297.
In considering a federal law’s preemptive effect, “the ultimate touchstone” is Congress’s purpose in enacting the law. Id. at 1297 (quoting Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 566 U.S. 70, 76, 129 S.Ct. 538, 172 L.Ed.2d 398 (2008)). Relatedly, in determining whether a state law is preempted, the Court must “consider[ j the target at which the state law aims."" Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1591, 1599, 191 L.Ed.2d 511 (2015) (emphases in original).
State laws may be either “field” or “conflict” preempted. Field preemption exists where “Congress has forbidden the State to take, action in the field that the federal statute pre-empts.” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1595. In such circumstances, “Congress may have intended to foreclose any state regulation in the area, irrespective of whether state law is consistent or inconsistent .with federal standards.” Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Conflict preemption, by contrast, “exists where compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of . the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Id. (citation and internal- quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiffs allege that the CES Order is both field and conflict preempted by the FPA, For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that it is neither.12
A. Field Preemption
The FPA is a paragon of cooperative federalism; it divides responsibility for the regulation of energy between state and federal regulators. See Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1292. For statutes such as the FPA, “where ‘coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for federal pre-emption becomes a less persuasive one.’” Id. at 1300 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quoting New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 421, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973)).
FERC, on behalf of the' federal government, has exclusive authority “to regulate ‘the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce’ and ‘the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.’’” FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n (hereafter, “EPSA”), — U.S. -, *568136 S.Ct. 760, 767, 193 L.Ed.2d 661 (2016) (quoting 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1)).13 Particularly relevant here, FERC also has the authority “to ensure that rules or practices ‘affecting* wholesale rates are just and reasonable.” Id. at 774 (discussing 16 U.S.C. § 824e(a)); see also 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a). This “affecting” jurisdiction is limited to rules or practices that “directly affect the wholesale rate.” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 774 (internal marks and citation omitted). “Indirect or tangential impacts on wholesale electricity rates” do not suffice; otherwise, the FPA’s grant of jurisdiction to FERC would “assum[e] near-infinite breadth.” Id.
Although FERC has substantial authority over interstate wholesale energy sales, the regulation of retail rates for sales of electricity belongs to the States. Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1292. Within the zone of exclusive state jurisdiction are “within-state wholesale sales” and “retail sales of electricity (i.e., sales directly to users).” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 768. States also retain jurisdiction “over facilities used for the generation of electric energy.” 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1). As discussed supra, to determine whether a State is regulating retail or wholesale rates, the Court must consider the target of the state law. Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1599.14
1. Unconstitutional “Tethering” Under Hughes
The Supreme Court recently grappled with the issue of preemption under the FPA in Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, — U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1288, 194 L.Ed.2d 414 (2016). In Hughes, the Court concluded that a Maryland energy program was preempted because it imper-missibly “set[] an interstate wholesale rate, contravening the FPA’s division of authority between state and federal regulators.” 136 S.Ct. at 1297. The Maryland program, which obliged Maryland LSEs to enter into a contract-for-differences with a favored generator, required the favored generator to participate in the wholesale capacity auction, but guaranteed that generator the more favorable contract price (rather than the market-clearing price) for its energy. Id. at 1294-95, 1297. Importantly, the generator’s receipt of the subsidy was explicitly contingent on the generator’s sale of capacity into the wholesale auction: if the generator’s capacity cleared the auction, and the market-clearing price was below the price stipulated in the contract-for differences, the LSEs paid the generator the difference between the contract price and the clearing price. Id. at 1295. The generator did not receive the subsidy if its capacity failed to clear the auction. Id. Because the Maryland program conditioned the generator’s receipt of the subsidy on the generator’s participation in the auction, but guaranteed the generator a rate distinct from the market-clearing price, Hughes concluded that the Maryland program “adjusted] an interstate wholesale rate” and was accordingly preempted. Id. at 1297.
Hughes, however, left open the possibility for States to “encourag[e] production of new or clean generation through measures ‘untethered to a generator’s wholesale market participation.’ ” Id. at 1299 (citation omitted). In doing so, the Supreme Court declined to address the permissibility of other State measures to incentivize clean *569energy, such as “tax incentives, land grants, direct subsidies, construction of state-owned generation facilities,, or re-regulation of the energy sector.” Id. Hughes emphasized: “So long as a State does not condition payment of funds on capacity clearing the auction, the State’s program would not suffer from the fatal defect that renders Maryland’s program unacceptable.” Id.
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is preempted under Hughes because, like the challenged Maryland program, the ZEC program is “tethered” to the wholesale auction. Plaintiffs argue that there is an impermissible tether because: (1) a nuclear generator is eligible for a ZEC only if the NYISO auction rates are insufficient for the generator to stay in business; (2) ZEC prices are calculated using forecast wholesale rates; and (3) the nuclear generators receiving the ZECs sell all of their power directly into the auction markets. Opp. 19-22; Oral Arg. Tr. (hereafter, “Tr.”) 22:2-23:22, 32:16-34:14, Dkt. 141 (Mar. 29, 2017). Unsurprisingly, Defendants and Intervenors dispute all of these arguments. The Court agrees with Defendants and Intervenors.
The Court is not convinced by Plaintiffs’ first argument. A whole host of measures that States might employ to encourage clean energy development — such as tax incentives or direct subsidies — involve propping up the operation of a generator that might otherwise be unprofitable. Hughes did not prohibit such state assistance, see Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299, and Plaintiffs have not argued that such state subsidies are per se preempted.
Nor does the use of forecast wholesale rates in calculating the ZEC price create an unconstitutional tether. Hughes clearly stated 'that the impermissible tether was “to a generator’s wholesale market participation,” id, at 1299 (emphasis added), and nowhere stated, implied or even considered that a State program’s incorporation of the wholesale market price would provide a basis for preemption.15 Plaintiffs have not provided any persuasive argument why using wholesale prices, actual or forecast, as' a metric for calculating the price of a ZEC creates a tether that leads to preemption.
Rochester Gas & Electric Corp. v. PSC, 754 F.2d 99 (2d Cir. 1985) forecloses Plaintiffs’ attempt to hook preemption to price. Rochester Gas concluded that the State’s consideration of a “reasonable estimate” of wholesale sales revenue in calculating intrastate"" retail rates (an area of State jurisdiction) did not render the state program at issue preempted. 754 F.2d at 100-01, 105. The Second Circuit found “a distinction between, on the one hand, regulating [wholesale] sales, and on the other, reflecting the profits from a reasonable estimate *570of those sales in jurisdictional rates.” Id, at 105. Plaintiffs attempt to' distinguish Rochester Gas by noting that Rochester Gas involved regulation at the retail level, Tr. 31:24-32:8, 48:6-10, but that is a distinction without a difference. Regulation of retail rates, like the regulation of environmental attributes, is within the zone, of state jurisdiction, and Rochester Gas held that merely considering or incorporating wholesale prices in rate-setting for a state-regulated activity does not , intrude upon federal authority.16 Rochester Gas, 754 F.2d at 105 (New York “may impute revenue from a reasonable estimate of [wholesale] sales” in considering the generator’s retail revenue).
Plaintiffs also argue that the ZEC program is directly tied to the wholesale auction because “[a]ll electricity produced by these nuclear generators must be sold directly or indirectly in the NYISO auctions, as there are no alternative. markets.” Compl. ¶ 64; see also Tr. 22:7-8 (“[T]he nuclear plants[ ] have no alternative but to sell their output in the energy auction .... ”). Plaintiffs highlight that the nuclear generators are “price takers,” Tr. 22:8, and that the nuclear generators “are exempt wholesale generators under the Public Utility Holding Act [ (“PUHA”) ],” which, according to Plaintiffs, requires the generators to sell all of their power and capacity into the wholesale auction. Tr. 22:10-16.
This argument is no more than an attempt to fashion a “tether” by jamming a square peg into a round hole; Plaintiffs’ argument rewrites the CES Order. The CES Order itself does not require the nuclear generators to sell into the NYISO auction. As discussed supra, the nuclear generators' receive ZECs for their zero-emissions production of energy, and not for the sale of that energy into the wholesale market; the CES Order grants ZECs to eligible nuclear generators, without any mention of whether or where the generators sell their power. See CES Order at 124-29 (discussing criteria for generators to receive ZECs). In that respect, the ZEC program is critically different from the challenged program in Hughes, which specifically conditioned subsidy payments on the generator’s sale of capacity into the auction. See Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1295, 1297, 1299.
Even accepting as true Plaintiffs’ allegation that the generators do, as a matter of fact, sell their entire output into the auction, see Compl. ¶64, that is a business decision; it is not a requirement imposed by New York. Plaintiffs have not cited, and the Court has not been able to find, any case in which a state program has been found to be field preempted based on a private business decision rather than a state directive. What the' generators choose to do, as a matter of their business organization or as a product of their business decisions, is irrelevant from a preemption perspective. See Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *13 (finding the ZEC program not preempted because “the ZEC program does not mandate auction clearing ... and the state, while taking advantage of these attributes to confer a benefit on nuclear power, is not imposing a condition directly on wholesale transactions”). -
*571The fact that the nuclear generators currently claim status as exempt wholesale generators under PUHA is similarly irrelevant. Intervenors note that PUHA permits generators to withdraw their wholesale generator status, 18 C.F.R. § 366.7(c)(3),17 but even if PUHA did not permit withdrawal and did require the generators to sell entirely, into the auction, the critical point is that New York has not required the generators to participate in the auction: nothing about the CES Order tethers the generators’, receipt of ZECs to their sale of energy into the auction. Put differently, a change in PUHA would not unravel the CES Order or interfere with New York’s ZEC program. That is why PUHA is a red herring. The law of preemption examines state action and considers whether state action has intruded upon the federal government’s turf. It cannot be disputed that the CES Order does not require the generators to sell into the auction — that is, it does not tether the generators’ receipt of ZECs to their participation in the auction. It is that aspect of the CES Order that saves the ZEC program from the problems faced in Hughes.
In summary, the Maryland program at issue in Hughes conditioned the' generators’ receipt of a favorable rate (distinct from the auction rate) on the generators’ capacity clearing the auction; there was a direct and concrete tie (or tether) between the contracts-for-difference and the generator’s wholesale market participation. Here, a ZEC is available based on the environmental attributes of the energy production — specifically, for-' the generators’ production of zero-emissions energy — without consideration of the generators’ participation in the auction. Like the challenged Connecticut program in Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2017), the ZEC program does not suffer from Hughes’s “fatal defect” because the ZEC program “does not condition capacity transfers on [the wholesale] auction.” 861 F.3d at 99. Rather, the purchase or sale of ZECs, like the contracts at issue in the Connecticut program, reflect transactions that occur “independent of the auction.” Id.
2. ZECs Do Not Directly Adjust, Alter, or Affect the Wholesale Rate . ■
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is preempted because “the ZEC payments directly alter the wholesale price paid by LSEs and received by the nuclear generators.” Opp. 19. They argue that by guaranteeing nuclear generators greater total compensation (i,e., the auction clearing price plus the value of its ZECs) than what they will receive at auction (clearing price only), the ZEC program disregards interstate wholesale rates that FERC has deemed just and reasonable. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that ZECs artificially depress the auction market-clearing price by allowing the nuclear generators to continue to participate as price-takers, thus increasing the supply of energy and thereby reducing the wholesale price.
Plaintiffs’ argument commits the logical fallacy of concluding that state'actions that affect the wholesale price in some way are the same as state actions that set the wholesale rate. In EPSA, the Supreme Court stated that “[t]o set a retail electrici*572ty rate is ... to establish the amount of money a consumer will hand over in exchange for power.” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 777. Although EPSA was addressing retail rates, this Court sees no principled basis— in the statutory text, EPSA’s discussion or otherwise — to conclude that the definition of “to set a rate” is different in the retail and wholesale contexts. Moreover, the EPSA definition is consistent with Hughes. Hughes concluded that the Maryland program did adjust and “set” an interstate wholesale rate because the program “required [the generator] to participate in the □capacity auction, but guarantees [the generator] a rate distinct from the clearing price for its interstate sales of capacity.” Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1297. Here, the ZEC sales and the wholesale sales of energy or capacity are entirely separate transactions, with the ZEC sales occurring independently of the wholesale auction and neither one conditioned on the other. Therefore, the ZEC program does not adjust or “set” the amount of money that a generator receives in exchange for the generator’s sale of energy or capacity into the auction.
Nor is the ZEC program preempted because of the ZECs’ effects on the wholesale auction. FERC has jurisdiction over “rules or practices that directly affect the [wholesale] rate,” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 774 (alterations in original) (citation and quotation marks omitted), but “indirect or tangential impacts on wholesale electricity rates” fall outside FERC jurisdiction, id. Even if ZECs have an effect on the wholesale auction — which Plaintiffs allege and the Court must accept as true — Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the ZECs directly affect wholesale rates such that they intrude upon federal jurisdiction.
In Allco, the Second Circuit squarely rejected the argument that the fact that the challenged contracts would “increase the supply of electricity available to Connecticut utilities,” thereby exerting “downward pressure ... that will have an effect on wholesale prices,” meant that the Connecticut contracts “infring[ed] upon FERC’s regulatory authority.” Allco, 861 F.3d at 101. The Second Circuit concluded that any such effect on wholesale prices was “incidental” and did not “amount to a regulation of the interstate wholesale electricity market that infringes on FERC’s jurisdiction.” Id. Plaintiffs here allege that ZECs affect wholesale prices by exerting pressure on the market forces that play out in the wholesale auction, but they, too, fail to state a plausible claim that ZECs directly affect wholesale rates. Like the Allco contracts, ZECs have only an incidental effect on wholesale rates and thus do not intrude upon FERC jurisdiction.
Fatal to Plaintiffs’ argument is their failure to offer any cogent explanation why ZECs are preempted but other state incentives to generate clean energy — such as tax exemptions, land grants, or direct financial subsidies — are not. Such incentives also allow clean energy generators to be more competitive than they would otherwise be, and they therefore also affect price signals in the wholesale auction. Plaintiffs even concede that such measures “would have some of the same effects” on the market. Tr. 26:2-3.
Hughes declined to rule on the permissibility of such state-incentive measures, see Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299 (“We ... need not and do not address the permissibility of various other measures States might employ to encourage development of new or clean generation, including tax incentives, land grants, [and] direct subsidies .... ”), and Plaintiffs do not argue here that such incentives are per se impermissible, Tr. 25:22-26:4 (acknowledging that “if New York decided to just write a check to a nuclear plant, that would have some of the same effects”). Hughes made *573clear that it did not mean to discourage States from incentivizing clean energy-generation so long as the measures taken are not tethered to a generator’s wholesale market participation. Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299. The Supreme Court implicitly acknowledged that state actions to encourage clean energy production may make price signals from the auction less relevant. Id. (citing Respondents’ discussion that States may make the price signals in the auction “less relevant by subsidizing new generation,” Brief for Respondents 40). Other than their theories of “tethering,” which this Court has already rejected, Plaintiffs offer no explanation for why the effects of ZECs on price signals in the auction are any different from, for example, the effects a tax incentive given to the nuclear plants would have on those same price signals. There may (or may not) be a difference in degree, but there is no difference in kind.
The death knell for Plaintiffs’ field-preemption argument is their failure to distinguish ZECs from RECs. In WSPP, FERC concluded that RECs fall outside FERC jurisdiction because they are -state-created certifications of an energy attribute that are unbundled from wholesale energy sales. WSPP, Inc., 139 FERC P 61061, 2012 WL 1395532, ¶¶18, 21, 24 (FERC Apr. 20, 2012). WSPP held that these unbundled transactions did not affect wholesale rates and were not “in connection with” wholesale sales of electricity. Id. ¶ 24; see also Allco, 861 F.3d at 93 (“RECs are inventions of state property law whereby the renewable energy attributes are ‘unbundled’ from the energy itself and sold separately.” (quoting Wheelabrator Lisbon Inc. v. Conn. Dep’t of Pub. Util. Control, 531 F.3d 183, 186 (2d Cir. 2008))). Curiously, Plaintiffs argue that WSPP supports their position.
Plaintiffs argue that WSPP does not foreclose their preemption claim because WSPP noted that a wholesale sale that “requires the use of an emissions allowance” is subject to FERC jurisdiction because such a transaction would directly affect and be “in connection with” the wholesale rate, WSPP ¶¶ 22-23. Plaintiffs argue that because the ZEC program requires that LSEs purchase ZECs in proportion to the electric energy load that they serve, Compl. ¶73, ZECs are not “unbundled” from wholesale sales as RECs are. Opp. 28-29.
Plaintiffs’ argument fails given the allegations in their own Complaint: the REC program also requires that LSEs purchase RECs in proportion to their total electricity load or to make a compliance payment. Compl. ¶ 49; CES Order at 14, 16. That LSEs may make a REC compliance payment, but no analogous ZEC compliance payment exists, is immaterial; the REC program, like the ZEC program, requires that LSEs make a proportional payment. See CES' Order at 109-10. Like RECs, ZECs are credits for the environmental attributes of energy production. Like the sales of RECs, sales of ZECs are unbundled from wholesale sales for energy or capacity. If RECs are not preempted (and WSPP makes clear that they are not), then the Court fails to see how ZECs are.
Plaintiffs further argue that RECs are distinguishable from ZECs because: REC prices are not calculated using forecast wholesale prices, Opp. 30-31; RECs are available to all generators, not just a favored few, Opp. 31; and ZECs are not unbundled from or “independent- of other ‘attributes’ ” of the eligible generators because the generators receive ZECs based on their inability to remain profitable from wholesale market sales, Opp. 31. See also, Compl. ¶¶ 50-51. For these reasons, Plaintiffs claim that “the REC is different and is not subject to the same issues,” Tr. *57421:6-7; see also Tr. 31:4-6 (“You don’t have that tie for the RECs”). *
Although there are factual differences between ZECs and RECs, none is legally significant. As discussed above, the fact that the ZEC price is calculated using a forecast of wholesale prices does not ipean that the ZEC program is preempted. Nothing in WSPP considered the REC pricing mechanism to be constitutionally significant; indeed, WSPP did not even explicitly address how RECs were priced.18 That RECs are available to any energy producer that uses renewable sources, whereas ZECs are available only to energy producers that satisfy certain other requirements does not pose a preemption concern.19 Plaintiffs cite no cases supporting their theory that subsidizing only a few generators is problematic from a preemption perspective. Plaintiffs’ creative rephrasing of “unbundled” as “independent of other ‘attributes’ ” also is unavailing. WSPP held that the “unbundled REC transaction” was not preempted because it was “independent of a wholesale electric energy transaction.” WSPP ¶24 (emphasis added). WSPP nowhere said that RECs were not preempted because they were independent of other attributes.
Like a REC, a. ZEC is a certification of an energy attribute that is separate from a wholesale charge or rate. Like a REC, the purchase or. sale of a ZEC is the purchase or sale of this attribute, rather than the purchase or sale of wholesale energy. Like a REC, the purchase or sale of a ZEC is independent of the purchase or sale of wholesale energy. Like a REC, payment for a ZEC is not conditioned on the generator’s participation in the wholesale auction; rather, RECs and ZECs are given in exchange for the renewable energy or zero-emissions production of energy by generators. Compl. ¶ 64 (“payment of ZEC subsidies occurs if, and only if, the nuclear generator ‘produces’ electricity”); CES Order, App’x E at 1. Because of these similarities between ZECs and RECs, the effect of ZE.Cs on the wholesale auction is legally indistinguishable from the effect of RECs on the wholesale auction.20 FERC has clearly held that RECs are not preempted. The Court cannot find any principled basis to hold that the ZEC program is preempted even though its sibling REC program is not.
3. Plaintiffs’ Attempt to Analogize to Other Preempted State Measures Is Unpersuasive
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program’s effect on wholesale prices is “far greater” than the effects of programs held preempt*575ed in Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293, 108 S.Ct. 1145, 99 L.Ed.2d 316 (1988), Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 108 S.Ct. 2428, 101 L.Ed.2d 322 (1988), Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953, 106 S.Ct. 2349, 90 L.Ed.2d 943 (1986), and Northern Natural Gas Company v. State Corporation Commission of Kansas, 372 U.S. 84, 83 S.Ct. 646, 9 L.Ed.2d 601 (1963). The Court disagrees. Those cases • all involved obvious state intrusions into the federal government’s area of responsibility that are absent from the ZEC program. In Oneok, the Supreme Court made clear that the Schneidewind program was preempted because the state law was “directed at ... the control of rates and facilities of natural gas companies ... precisely the things over which FERC has comprehensive authority.” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1600 (quoting Schneidewind, 485 U.S. at 308, 108 S.Ct. 1145). The Court found that the Schneide-wind program “was designed to keep a natural gas company from raising its equity levels above a certain point in order to keep the company’s revenue requirement low, thereby ensuring lower wholesale rates.” Id. (citing Schneidewind, 485 U.S. at 307-08, 108 S.Ct. 1145). As discussed supra, and unlike in Schneidewind, the ZEC program is not directed at and does not directly affect wholesale rates.
Mississippi Power and Nantahala also do not help Plaintiffs’ case. In Mississippi Power, which is a conflict (not field) preemption case, the State barred the utility from recovering costs that the utility was required to pay under a FERC order mandating a certain allocation of power. Mississippi Power, 487 U.S. at 373-74, 108 S.Ct. 2428. The Supreme Court concluded that “Mississippi’s inquiry into the reasonableness of FERC-approved purchases” was preempted by FERC. Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1601-02 (discussing Mississippi Power). Similarly, in Nantahala, which also is a conflict preemption case and a case on which Mississippi Power relied, a State commission prevented the utility from recovering the costs incurred in paying the wholesale rate for a FERC-man-dated allocation of power. Mississippi Power, 487 U.S. at 370-71, 108 S.Ct. 2428 (discussing Nantahala). As in Nantahala, the Supreme Court held that the State commission’s action-was preempted. Id. at 370-73, 108 S.Ct. 2428 (discussing Nant-ahala). Here, the ZEC program does not challenge or seek to re-determine the reasonableness of the wholesale rate. Rather, ZECs are payments for the environmental attributes of zero-emission energy. Unlike the challenged state laws in Mississippi Power and Nantahala, and despite Plaintiffs’ protestations otherwise, the ZEC program is simply not tethered to the wholesale rate.
Lastly, Northern Natural Gas is simply inapposite. In that case, Kansas required the ratable purchase of gas from a particular gas field. N. Nat. Gas, 372 U.S. at 85-86, 83 S.Ct. 646. The Supreme Court held that Kansas’ orders were preempted because they were “unambiguously directed at purchasers who take gas in Kansas for resale .after transportation ip interstate commerce” and thereby invaded federal jurisdiction “over the sale and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce for resale.” Id. at 90-92, 83 S.Ct. 646 (Kan-sas orders “directly affect[ed] the ability of the Federal Power Commission to regulate comprehensively and effectively the transportation and sale of natural gas, and to achieve the uniformity of regulation, which was an objective of the Natural Gas Act.”). Unlike in Northern Natural Gas, the ZEC program does not order utilities to make any purchases of energy or capacity, let alone, from any particular electricity source.
*576In sum, the Court concludes that the ZEC program is not field preempted. By establishing a program that does not condition or tether ZEC payments to wholesale auction participation, New York has successfully threaded the needle left by Hughes that allows States to adopt innovative programs to encourage the production of clean energy. See Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299. For the foregoing reasons, the Complaint does not state a plausible claim of field preemption.
B. Conflict Preemption
Conflict preemption “exists where compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1595 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “State regulation of production may be pre-empted as conflicting with FERC’s authority over interstate transportation and rates if it is impossible to comply with both state and federal law; if state regulation prevents attainment of FERC’s goals; or if a state regulation’s impact on matters within federal control is not an incident of efforts to achieve a proper state purpose.” Nw. Cent. Pipeline Corp. v. State Corp. Comm’n of Kansas, 489 U.S. 493, 515-16, 109 S.Ct. 1262, 103 L.Ed.2d 509 (1989). Where, as here, conflict preemption is alleged based on the obstacle presented by state law to the federal purpose and objective, “[w]hat constitutes a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.” In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., 725 F.3d 65, 101 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also PPL EnergyPlus, LLC v. Nazarian, 753 F.3d 467, 478 (4th Cir. 2014) (same).
In “a system of ‘interlocking’ [state and federal] jurisdiction” like the FPA, Nazarian, 753 F.3d at 478; see also Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1300 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), “conflict preemption analysis must be applied sensitively ... so as to prevent the diminution of the role Congress reserved to the States while at the same time preserving the federal role,” Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 515, 109 S.Ct. 1262. When state law has an impact on matters within FERC’s control, “the State’s purpose must be to regulate production or other subjects of state jurisdiction, and the means chosen must at least plausibly be related to matters of legitimate state concern.” Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 518, 109 S.Ct. 1262. A state law “creates a conflict rather than demands an accommodation” when the State is attempting to regulate a matter of federal concern in the guise of regulating a matter of state concern. Id. But when the State is legitimately regulating a matter of state concern, “FERC’s exercise of its authority must accommodate” that state regulation “[ujnless clear damage to federal goals would result.” Id. at 522, 109 S.Ct. 1262.
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is conflict preempted because it causes “clear damage” to and “interferes with FERC’s regulatory objective” of maintaining competitive energy markets. Opp. 32-33. Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program “disrupts] market signals” and “interferes with FERC’s decision to structure the wholesale markets ... on market-based principles” to encourage the maintenance of efficient generators. Compl. ¶¶ 88-89. Plaintiffs further argue that conflict preemption presents a factual issue inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss. Opp. 34.
Defendants and Intervenors respond that the ZEC program is consistent with FERC’s policy statements and that NYT-*577SO,- which administers FERC’s markets in New York, has endorsed the ZEC program. 'Defs. Mem. 8-9; Intervenors Mem. 19-20. Intervenors further note that if .the ZEC program were interfering with federal objectives, “FERC has abundant steps it could take but has chosen to take none of them,” Tr. 15:21-22, To the contrary, as Intervenors note, FERC has concluded that state programs that incentivize clean energy generation are consistent with FERC’s policy objectives. Intervenors Mem. 19 (collecting FERC decisions).
Accepting the Complaint’s factual allegations as true, as the Court must at this stage, the Complaint does not state a plausible claim of conflict preemption. The ZEC program is plainly related to a matter of legitimate state concern: the production of clean energy and the. reduction of carbon emissions from the production of other energy. Thus, in the interlocking jurisdictional scheme provided by the FPA, there is no. conflict preemption “[u]n-less clear damage to federal goals would result.” Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 522, 109 S.Ct. 1262.
Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program “interferes with FERC’s decision to structure the wholesale markets ... on market-based principles” to encourage efficient generators. Compl. ¶ 89. Accepting as true that one of FERC’s goals .is to promote market efficiency through energy auctions, there is no conflict. The ZEC program does not run afoul of the goal of having an efficient energy market. Instead, by incen-tivizing clean energy production, it seeks to minimize the environmental damage that is done by generating electricity through the -use of gas and fossil fuels. CES Order at 19. Far from objecting to state programs that encourage energy production with certain desirable environmental attributes, FERC has approved state programs with “renewable portfolio mandates and greenhouse reduction goals.”. See, e.g., Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 123 FERC P 61067, 2008 WL 1780603, ¶ 34 (FERC Apr. 21, 2008). The ZEC program does not thwart the goal of an efficient energy market; rather, it encourages through financial incentives the production of clean energy.
Plaintiffs’ only remaining allegations relative to their conflict preemption claim are that ZECs “will disrupt market signals” within the auction, Compl. ¶ 88, and that “the ZECs will have market-distorting ripple effects throughout the national market and beyond New York’s borders,” Compl. ¶ 90. Accepting these factual allegations as true, Plaintiffs have not stated a plausible claim of conflict preemption.
Plaintiffs’ core complaint is that the ZEC program will permit certain nuclear generators to continue to participate in the energy market when they otherwise would have gone out of business.21 Compl. ¶ 58. But, as discussed supra, Allco concluded that the fact that the Connecticut program would “increase the supply of electricity,” thereby affecting wholesale prices, did not mean that the Connecticut program was preempted. Allco, 861 F.3d at 101 (“This incidental effect on wholesale prices does not, ... amount to a regulation of the interstate wholesale electricity market that infringes on FERC’s jurisdiction.”).22 *578H&e, too, any effects exerted by ZECs on the market auctions are indirect and incidental; those effects do not cause-the sort of “clear - damage to federal .goals,” Nw. Cent. 489 U.S. at 522, 109 S.Ct. 1262, that would give rise to a claim of conflict preemption, See Nazarian, 753 F.3d at 479-80 (“Obviously, not every state regulation that incidentally affects federal markets is preempted. Such an- outcome ‘would- .thoroughly undermine precisely the division of the regulatory field that Congress went to so much trouble to establish ..., and would render Congress’ specific grant of power to the States to regulate production virtually meaningless.’ ” (quoting Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 515, 109 S.Ct. 1262)). As discussed .supra, other forms of state incentives give the incentive-recipient this same sort of leg up in .the market.. If those incentives, including. RECs, are not conflict preempted — and Plaintiffs do not argue that they are — then the Court fails to see how ZECs are.
Plaintiffs argue that the issue of conflict preemption is not appropriately decided on a motion to dismiss, pointing out that other district courts decided the conflict preemption question- after considering factual and expert' evidence in the case. See PPL EnergyPlus, LLC v. Nazarian (hereafter, “Nazarian II”), 974 F.Supp.2d 790 (D. Md. 2013); PPL EnergyPlus, LLC v. Hanna, 977 F.Supp.2d 372 (D.N.J. 2013). Nazarian II and Hanna, however, presented plausible claims of conflict preemption. In those cases, the programs guaranteed a fixed price that displaced the wholesale auction price; that displacement resulted in clear damage to FERC’s goal of setting wholesale prices at auction. See Mem. and Order re: Mot. to Dismiss at 11, EOF 71, Nazarian II, No. MJG-12-1286 (D. Md. Aug. 3, 2012) (Plaintiffs asserted a plausible claim of conflict preemption based on their allegation that the generator benefit-ting from the Maryland program was “guaranteed receipt of the PSC fixed price” through a contract for difference and was therefore “not appropriately market-based.”); 23 see also Mem. and Order at 9, ECF 69, PPL Energy Plus, LLC v. Solomon (“Hanna""), No. 11-745 (D.N.J. Oct. 19, 2011) (Conflict preemption claim survived the motion to dismiss because the New Jersey program, which “impermissi-bly guarantee[d] a wholesale capacity price,” thereby “impede[d] FERC’s policy of establishing-a market-based approach to setting wholesale energy rates in the mid-Atlantic market.” (citing allegations' that New Jersey’s utilities are required to procure power at a fixed price approved by the State)). Put differently, the Naza/rian II and Hanna' programs stood-as an obstacle to FERC’s policy of using market principles to set wholesale prices because those programs guaranteed a predetermined, state-approved price, rather than the market auction price, for the wholesale sale' of energy or capacity.
*579No such • obstacle exists for the ZEC program. Unlike Nazarian II and Hanna, the ZEC program does not guarantee a certain wholesale price that displaces the market-determined price. Recognizing FERC’s goal to set wholesale prices through a market-based approach, the Court fails to see how the ZEC program causes clear damage to that goal. As discussed above, the nuclear generators receiving ZECs will receive for their energy whatever the market-clearing price is. Separately, they will be compensated for their ZECs, which are awarded based on the positive attributes of the energy they generate. Any price-distorting effects exerted by the ZECs on the market signals at the wholesale auctions are, at best, indirect and do not present the sort of “clear damage” required 'for a plausible conflict preemption claim. To hold otherwise would call into question RECs and all state subsidies, such as tax incentives and land grants; such subsidies, too, exert price-distorting effects on market signals and allow some generators to clear the auction when they otherwise would be priced out.
Plaintiffs cite International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987), to argue that state programs with the potential to undermine a federal regulatory structure are conflict preempted because States “cannot ‘do indirectly what they could not do directly.’ ” Opp. 32 (quoting Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 495, 107 S.Ct. 805). Ouellette is inapposite. In Ouellette, the Court considered whether a Vermont nuisance law was preempted by the Clean Water Act, which established a federal permit program regulating the discharge of pollutants and assigned different state regulatory roles based on whether the State was the source of the discharge. 479 U.S. at 489-91, 107 S.Ct. 805. Because application of the Vermont law could “effectively override the permit requirements and the policy choices made by the source State,” the Court concluded that the Vermont law effectively circumvented and upset the balance of interests contemplated by the Clean Water Act. Id. at 494-95, 107 S.Ct. 805. Accordingly, the Court held that the Vermont law was conflict preempted. Id. at 487, 493-97, 107 S.Ct. 805.
Nothing about the ZEC program “effectively override[s],” id. at 495, 107 S.Ct. 805, the FPA. ZECs do not circumvent the FERC auction — at the risk of being redundant, ZECs, like RECs, are payments for environmental attributes that are unbundled from' and involve separate transactions than those for the wholesale sales of energy or capacity. If the ZEC program were aimed at wholesale market participation or wholesale prices for sales of energy or capacity, then this would be a stronger case for conflict preemption. Unlike the Vermont law at issue in Ouellette, which did present a clear conflict between the state law and the federal regulatory scheme, the ZEC program does not “stand[ ] as an obstacle,” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1595 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), to the FERC auction or the FPA.
Plaintiffs’ proposed discovery highlights the implausibility of their conflict preemption claim. The only two topics of discovery proposed by Plaintiffs relevant to the conflict preemption claim are: (1) fact discovery supporting Plaintiffs’ allegation that “the nuclear energy is not being sold directly to any customers at retail; it’s going into the auction process”; and (2) fact and expert discovery to demonstrate that the ZEC program ‘Will, in fact, have"" a substantial impact on the wholesale rate.” Status Conference Tr. 29:25-3,0:9-10, Dkt. 90 (Dee. 16, 2016), Again, even if all of the nuclear generators’ electricity is sold into the auction and the ZECs have an impact on the wholesale rate by affecting market signals, Plaintiffs will not have stated a *580plausible claim of conflict preemption. No factual discovery into these topics will surmount the core problem with Plaintiffs’ claim: the ZECs are not tethered to wholesale sales in a way that causes clear damage to federal goals.
Therefore, the Court concludes that the Complaint does not state a plausible claim of conflict preemption.24
III. DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE
The Commerce Clause empowers Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce .., among the several States.” U.S. Const, art. I, § 8, cl. 3. “The negative or dormant implication of the Commerce Clause prohibits state ... regulation ... that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby impedes free private trade in the national marketplace.” Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287, 117 S.Ct. 811, 136 L.Ed.2d 761 (1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). But “there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Kassel v. Consol. Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U.S. 662, 669, 101 S.Ct. 1309, 67 L.Ed.2d 580 (1981) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, a state law or regulation violates the dormant Commerce Clause “only if it (1) ‘clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce,’ (2) ‘imposes a burden on interstate commerce incommensurate with the local benefits secured,’ or (3) ‘has the practical effect of “extraterritorial” control of commerce occurring entirely outside the boundaries of the state in question.’ ” Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., 584 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Freedom Holdings Inc. v. Spitzer, 357 F.3d 205, 216 (2d Cir. 2004)).
Only the first two means of violating the dormant Commerce Clause are at issue here. Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program violates the dormant Commerce Clause because: (1) the ZEC program facially discriminates against out-of-state energy producers, including nuclear and other carbon-free energy producers, by selecting only New York nuclear power plants to receive ZECs, Compl. ¶ 98; and (2) the ZEC program imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce by distorting market pricing and incentives, which will cause energy generators, including out-of-state energy providers, to leave the market or discourage their entry into the market, Compl. ¶99. Plaintiffs have no cause of action under either theory and have, in any event, failed to allege a dormant Commerce Clause claim.
A. Cause of Action
Intervenors argue that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing to bring a dormant Commerce Clause claim because they do not allege a nexus between their *581injury and any discriminatory aspect of the ZEC program. Intervenors Mem. 22; In-tervenors Reply 15. In other words, Inter-venors argue that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing because Plaintiffs’ injury does not fall within the dormant Commerce Clause’s zone of interests. Courts. have consistently applied the zone of interests test to dormant Commerce Clause claims to determine whether plaintiffs have prudential standing. See, e.g., Boston Stock Exch. v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U.S. 318, 320 n.3, 97 S.Ct. 599, 50 L.Ed.2d 514 (1977); Selevan, 584 F.3d at 91-92; Cibolo Waste, Inc. v. City of San Antonio, 718 F.3d 469, 474-76 (5th Cir. 2013); Fla. Transp. Services, Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cty., 703 F.3d 1230, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 116, 187 L.Ed.2d 35 (2013); Yakima Valley Mem’l Hosp. v. Wash. State Dep’t of Health, 654 F.3d 919, 932-33 (9th Cir. 2011); Freeman v. Corzine, 629 F.3d 146, 156-57 (3d Cir. 2010); Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n v. Daviess Cty., 434 F.3d 898, 901-02 (6th Cir. 2006), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 550 U.S. 931, 127 S.Ct. 2294, 167 L.Ed.2d 1087 (2007).
The Supreme Court recently held that the zone of interests test does not fall under the prudential standing rubric; instead, whether a plaintiffs injury falls within a law’s zone of interests goes to whether the plaintiff has a cause of action. Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 1387, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014). The Supreme Court in Lexmark addressed the zone of interests inquiry only as it applies to statutory claims; it did not address constitutional claims, such • as Plaintiffs’ dormant Commerce Clause claim. Id. To the Court’s knowledge, only the Third Circuit has addressed whether Lexmark applies to constitutional claims. In • Maher Terminals, the Third Circuit applied the zone of interests test to determine whether the plaintiff had stated a Tonnage Clause25 claim, while clarifying that post-Lexmark this was not a prudential standing issue.26 Maher Terminals, LLC v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 805 F.3d 98, 105, 110 (3d Cir. 2015). This Court sees no reason not to apply Lexmark to constitutional claims. Just as “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet,”27 so, too, does the zone of interests test apply whether labeled a prudential standing issue or a cause of action issue. The Supreme Court’s reasoning that the zone of interests test is more logically a cause of action question applies equally to statutory and constitutional claims, and Lexmark did not reject the zone of interests test — it merely reclassified it. Accordingly, and in light of the numerous cases that have applied the zone of interests test to dormant Commerce Clause claims, the Court applies the zone of interests test to determine whether Plaintiffs have alleged a cause of action.28
*582The zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce Clause is the economic interests of out-of-state entities. Allocco Recycling, Ltd. v. Doherty, 378 F.Supp.2d 348, 358 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); see also Yakima Valley Mem’l Hosp., 654 F.3d at 932 (“Any alleged injury ‘must somehow be tied to a barrier imposed on interstate commerce.’ ” (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Cty. of Kern, 581 F.3d 841, 848 (9th Cir. 2009))). In other words, Plaintiffs must “allege an injury stemming from the application of the [ZEC program] in a manner discriminatory to out-of-state interests,” L.A.M. Recovery, Inc. v. Dep’t of Consumer Affairs, 184 Fed.Appx. 86, 88-89 (2d Cir. 2006) (summary order) (citing Boston Stock Exch., 429 U.S. at 321, 97 S.Ct. 599), whether due to facial discrimination against or an undue burden on out-of-state economic interests.
Plaintiffs entirely fail to allege any injury arising from discrimination against or an undue burden on out-of-state economic interests. As to their claim that the ZEC program facially discriminates against out-of-state nuclear power providers by awarding ZECs only to New York nuclear power plants, Plaintiffs do not allege that they own or represent an out-of-state nuclear power plant.29 In addition, Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program is “directly- discriminatory” because it “is not even-handed with respect to other technologies that could produce carbon-free electricity,” Compl. ¶ 98, and that various Plaintiffs own or have members that own in- and out-of-state power suppliers (without specifying whether the power suppliers are nuclear), Compl. ¶¶ 10-15. That those Plaintiffs may be discriminated against because the ZEC program is available only to nuclear power plants — as opposed to other kinds of power plants that produce few or no greenhouse gas emissions — does not constitute a cause of action under the dormant Commerce Clause. That alleged injury does not fall within the zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce Clause — namely the protection of out-of-state economic interests. The dormant Commerce' Clause does not protect the economic interests of non-nuclear power plants, regardless of where they are located or whether they are carbon-free. See Nat’l Solid Waste Mgmt. Ass’n v. Pine Belt Reg’l Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 389 F.3d 491, 500 (5th Cir. 2004) (plaintiffs did not have prudential standing to bring dormant Commerce Clause claim on a facial discrimination theory because the plaintiffs’ injury was “not related to any out-of-state characteristic of their business”).
*583Plaintiffs also lack a cause of action to bring a dormant Commerce Clause claim on their undue burden theory. ■ According to that theory, Plaintiffs will be injured by the ZEC program because the otherwise unprofitable nuclear power plants receiving ZECs will drive down the auction prices received by all power plants, including Plaintiffs’ power plants, and will thus cause them to leave or discourage them from entering the market. Compl. ¶¶47, 74. But this alleged injury also falls outside the zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce. Clause. Under Plaintiffs’ theory, the same price-distorting effects and the same alleged injury would occur (probably to a more significant degree) if ZECs were extended to nuclear power plants nationwide.30 Thus, because Plaintiffs would be allegedly injured by the ZEC. program’s market distortion effect even if New York provided ZECs to in- and out-of-state nuclear power plants, Plaintiffs are not harmed because of an alleged undue burden on out-of-state economic interests.31
Although “the zone of interests test is not a rigorous one,” Nat’l Weather Serv. Employees Org., Branch 1-18 v. Brown, 18 F.3d 986, 989 (2d Cir. 1994), the interest sought to be protected must be at least arguably within the zone of interests to be protected by the dormant Commerce Clause, Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). Because Plaintiffs’ interests are, at best, “marginally related”- to the protection of out-of-state economic interests, Plaintiffs lack a cause of action.32 Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 760, 93 L.Ed.2d 757(1987).
B. Market Participant Exception and Subsidies
.Even if Plaintiffs had a cause of action, their dormant Commerce Clause claim would fail because New York was acting as a market participant, not as a regulator, when it created ZECs. The dormant Commerce Clause-“does not prohibit *584a state from participating in the free market if it acts like a private enterprise.” United Haulers Ass’n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 261 F.3d 246, 255 (2d Cir. 2001). “ ‘[A] state regulates when it exercises governmental powers that are unavailable to private parties,’ such as the imposition of civil or criminal penalties to compel behavior.” Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Pataki, 320 F.3d 200, 208 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting United Haulers Ass’n, Inc., 261 F.3d at 255). But, “[n]othing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.” Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 810, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976).
In Alexandria Scrap, in order to ameliorate the aesthetic and environmental problem associated with abandoned automobiles, Maryland created a bounty payable to any licensed processor that destroyed any vehicle formerly titled in Maryland. Id. at 797, 96 S.Ct. 2488. Maryland imposed a more burdensome title documentation requirement on out-of-state processors than in-state processors in order to receive the bounty. Id. at 801, 96 S.Ct. 2488. An out-of-state processor claimed that the Maryland law violated the dormant Commerce Clause because it gave Maryland processors an unfair advantage in the market for bounty-eligible hulks. Id. at 802, 96 S.Ct. 2488. The Supreme Court disagreed. It held that the Maryland law did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause because Maryland did not seek to prohibit the flow of hulks or regulate that flow but instead “entered into the market itself to bid up their price” for the legitimate purpose of protecting Maryland’s environment. Id. at 806, 809, 96 S.Ct. 2488. The Court acknowledged that the effect of the law was that Maryland hulks would be primarily destroyed by in-state processors and that in-state processors would primarily receive the bounties, but the Court held that “no trade barrier of the type forbidden by the Commerce Clause” restricted the movement of Maryland hulks out-of-state. Id. at 810, 96 S.Ct. 2488. Instead, the hulks remained in Maryland “in response to market forces, including that exerted by money from the State.” Id.
Building on Alexandria Scrap, in a case involving facts and allegations much closer to those at issue here, the District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissed the plaintiffs dormant Commerce Clause claim, reasoning that Connecticut was acting as a market participant when it created a market for RECs that subsidized clean energy generation. Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, Nos. 3:15-cv-608 (CSH), 3:16-cv-508 (CSH), 2016 WL 4414774, at *23-25 (D. Conn. Aug. 18, 2016), aff'd, 861 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2017). In Allco, the Plaintiff generated RECs in Georgia through one of its solar power facilities, but those RECs did not satisfy Connecticut’s requirements, which required that RECs be generated from power plants within the Northeast. Id. at *21. The district court concluded that, just as Maryland had incentivized market participants to destroy hulks by financially rewarding them to do so, Connecticut was merely making it “more lucrative for generators to produce and distribute clean energy in Connecticut” by creating a secondary REC market. Id. at *24. Connecticut is “not obligated to spread the benefit of that market to states that do not also bear the burden of the cost of the subsidy, which is ultimately paid by Connecticut ratepayers.” Id. The district court held that Connecticut was not acting as a regulator because it was “not preventing the flow of clean energy or regulating the con*585ditions on which it may occur.”33 Id.
This case follows in the footsteps of Alexandria Scrap and the district court’s decision in Allco. New York’s ZEC program does not create a trade barrier or prevent or regulate the flow of energy— renewable, nuclear, or otherwise. New York gives financially eligible nuclear generators that have historically contributed power into the New York market credit for the zero-emission attributes of each MWh of electricity they produce. Compl. ¶ 67. NYSERDA then buys the ZECs from the nuclear generators at an administratively determined price, and the cost is ultimately passed on to New York ratepayers. Compl. ¶¶ 69, 73. Just like Maryland in Alexandria Scrap and Connecticut in Allco, by distributing subsidies through the ZEC program to otherwise financially struggling nuclear power plants, New York is participating in the energy market and exercising its right to favor its own citizens.34 Moreover, just as Maryland and Connecticut were not required to subsidize out-of-state businesses when in-state residents were paying for the subsidies, neither is New York required to provide financial assistance in the form of ZECs to out-of-state power plants when the ZECs are ultimately paid for by New York ratepayers.
Plaintiffs argue that this ease is distinguishable because New York, and not the free market, sets the price of the ZECs and because ZECs are distributed on the basis of financial need, Opp. 40. Plaintiffs have not articulated why those distinctions are relevant to the dormant Commerce Clause analysis, and the Court does not find them to be relevant. New York is paying the nuclear power plants a set dollar amount for each MWh of electricity they produce in recognition of the zero-emission attributes of their electricity. This is no different than Maryland paying a set bounty to hulk processors. Whether the subsidy amount is at a government-set rate, as it is here and as it was in Alexandria Scrap, 426 U.S. at 797 n.5, 96 S.Ct. 2488, or set by market forces, as it was in Allco, 2016 WL 4414774, at *20, has no impact on the market participant analysis. Nor does the fact that ZECs are distributed based on financial need. The dormant Commerce Clause does not restrict which in-state businesses a State may subsidize when it is expending its own funds to do so, so long as the State does not also impose “taxes and regulatory measures impeding free private trade in the national *586marketplace,” Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U.S. 429, 436-37, 100 S.Ct. 2271, 65 L.Ed.2d 244 (1980).
Indeed, regardless of the market participant exception, although the Supreme Court has “never squarely confronted the constitutionality of subsidies,” Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 589, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997) (quotation marks and citation omitted), “[a] pure subsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no burden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business,” West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 199, 114 S.Ct. 2205, 129 L.Ed.2d 157 (1994); see also New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278, 108 S.Ct. 1803, 100 L.Ed.2d 302 (1988) (“Direct subsidization of domestic industry does not ordinarily run afoul of [the dormant Commerce Clause]... .”).35 The Supreme Court has, however, struck down a state subsidy; it did -so when a subsidy to in-state producers was coupled with a tax on in-state and out-of-state producers and thus functioned like a discriminatory tax on out-of-state producers. West Lynn Creamery, Inc., 512 U.S. at 214-15, 114 S.Ct. 2205. But the subsidy at issue here is not linked to a tax on out-of-state electricity generators — it is “a pure subsidy” for the environmental attributes of nuclear energy and"" is paid for by New York retail energy consumers. See C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 394, 114 S.Ct. 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 399 (1994) (noting' that instead of instituting an unconstitutional flow control ordinance to make a waste disposal facility commercially viable, the town could have subsidized the facility through general taxes or municipal bonds); see also United Haulers Ass’n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330, 368, 127 S.Ct. 1786, 167 L.Ed.2d 655 (2007) (same). Accordingly, the 'ZEC program is a permissible subsidy, and the market participant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause applies. For these additional reasons, the Complaint does not state a plausible dormant Commerce Clause claim.36

Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, — U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1288, 194 L.Ed.2d 414 (2016) is illustrative: ""For example, if four power plants bid to sell capacity at, respectively, $ 10/unit, $20/unit, $30/unit, and $40/unit, and the first three plants provide enough capacity to satisfy projected demand, [the auction administrator] will purchase capacity only from those three plants, each of which will receive $3 0/unit, the clearing price.” 136 S.Ct. at 1293.

. Amici New York Public Interest Research Group, Green Education and Legal Fund, Inc., Safe Energy Rights Group, Inc., and Promoting Health and Sustainable Energy, Inc. (collectively, “PIRG Amici”) argue that the generation of nuclear power is ""neither emissions free nor ‘zero-emissions,’ ” but instead emits radiation, waste heat, and greenhouse gases. Memorandum of Law of the Am-ici (“PIRG Amici Mem.”) 5-13, Dkt, 112-3. This may be true, but PIRG Amici do not go so far as to argue that the generation of nuclear power produces the same amount of noxious emissions as the generation of energy from fossil fuel or natural gas. At least with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, they assert that among the various ways to generate electricity, nuclear generation falls in the middle of the spectrum (wind producing the least and coal the most greenhouse gas emissions). PIRG Amici Mem. 8-9. The thrust of PIRG Amici's argument is that when creating the ZEC program, the PSC did not consider whether renewable energy sources could have *562replaced the nuclear generators or whether some nuclear power plants could be retired with no impact on electricity availability. PIRG Amici Mem. 8i 14 — 16; 18. the Court acknowledges that New York may have been able to adopt a more aggressive approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but nothing requires the States to make the perfect the enemy of the good.

.This year, only three nuclear generators in New York, Intervenors Robert Emmett Ginna plant’ (""Ginna”), James A. FitzPatrick plant (""FitzPatrick”), and Nine Mile Point plant, were deemed eligible for ZECs. CES Order at 128; see also• Compl. ¶ 58. Plaintiffs allege that without financial support from the State, the Ginna, FitzPatrick, and Nine Mile Point nuclear generators would have gone out of business.

. The PSC noted that it established an admin- . istrative process to set ZEC prices, rather than allowing them to be set by the market, because there would not be a competitive market process to set ZEC prices. CES Order, App’x E at 4 (""[Tjhere are too few owners of the affected generation facilities for there to be a valid competitive process to determine the prices as the owners would have too much market power for effective competition.”).

. The Second Circuit's caveat relative to private parties who invoke federal jurisdiction ""to enforce the federal law themselves” as compared to seeking ""to preclude a municipal entity from subjecting them to local laws enacted in violation of federal requirements” is not entirely clear. It would seem that the Second Circuit is raising a standing issue because a private party who seeks to enforce the federal law but does not seek to preclude *565the application of a local law to itself would appear to lack standing. But the Second Circuit does not mention standing in its equity jurisdiction analysis, nor is it clear how the issue of standing vel non should be viewed when attempting to determine whether a cause of action exists in the first instance.
 ↵ 
. Independent of whether the FPA’s requirement that wholesale electricity rates be.just and reasonable is a judicially administrable standard, the parties dispute whether Plain■tiffs’ preemption claims require the Court to apply that standard. Plaintiffs argue that they seek only to ensure that the FERC-set rate continues to govern New York wholesale energy transactions and are not asking the Court to set rates. Opp. 16-17. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Plaintiffs’ preemption claims are rate-related requests for in-junctive relief that implicate the just and reasonable rate-setting standard. Defs. Reply 11. *566The Court agrees with Plaintiffs but does not base its holding on this argument.
 ↵ 
. Iri a nearly identical case in which electricity generators challenged a ZEC program as preempted by the FPA, the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois came to the opposite conclusion, namely that determining a.""just and reasonable” rate is, a judicially unadministrable standard. Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *9. For the reasons explained supra, this Court disagrees , with the Northern District of Illinois’s conclusion that ""just and reasonable” is judicially unadministrable, Moreover, unlike this Court, see supra note 10, that court thought that it would need to apply that standard and effectively get involved in rate-setting in order to resolve the plaintiffs’ preemption claim, The Northern District of Illinois concluded that because there was ""too much” distortion of the wholesale market, the court, would be required to address how much states could subsidize local industry that touched the wholesale energy market before the effect of those subsidies resulted in a rate that was not just and reasonable. Id. at *9.
 ↵ 
. The Court notes that the Northern District of Illinois also held that the Illinois ZEC program was neither field nor conflict preempted, for many of the same reasons discussed infra. Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *10-14 (granting motions to dismiss).

 ↵ 
. Although Oneok involved the Natural Gas Act (""NGA”) rather than the FPA, the Supreme Court ""has routinely relied on NGA cases in determining the scope of the FPA, and vice versa.” Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1298 n.10.
 ↵ 
. For that reason, Plaintiffs’. argument that Hugh'es would not have been decided differently if the Maryland program incorporated forecast prices rather than actual ones, Opp. 19, misses the mark. Plaintiffs do not cite, and the Court has not found, any language in Hughes indicating that the Supreme Court considered the pricing calculation for the subsidies to be constitutionally relevant. The •problem with Maryland's program was that the contract-for-difference guaranteed a price and conditioned that guaranteed price on the generator’s energy clearing .the auction. Although the auction-clearing price was considered in calculating the amount that would be received under the contract-for-difference (because the generator received the difference between the contract price and the clearing price), the use of the auction-clearing price as a metric was not constitutionally relevant; rather, the impermissible tether was relative to the generator's wholesale market participation. Id. at 1295, 1299. The Court finds no basis to conclude that consideration of wholesale prices (whether forecast or actual) in pricing a subsidy is material to the preemption analysis.
 ↵ 
. As a. policy matter, using the forecast wholesale prices in the ZEC price calculation is a rational policy decision: it creates a one-way ratchet pursuant to which the ZEC price can be adjusted only downwards, see Compl. ¶ 71, Tr. 40:11-13, which inures to the benefit of Plaintiffs and the ratepayers. In addition, and as noted by Intervenors, ""this is an odd argument for [Plaintiffs] to make, because it effectively concedes the legality of the first two years of the program where the price is fixed....""Tr. 46:19-21.

. To claim status as an exempt wholesale generator, the generator may file with FERC a notice of self-certification or a petition for a declaratory order requesting such status, which FERC then reviews. 18 ■ C.F.R. §§ 366.7(a)-(b). A generator with exempt wholesale generator status may notify FERC that it no longer, seeks to maintain its status if ""there is’ any material change in facts that may affect” that generator's status. § 366.7(c)(3). In addition, the generator’s status may be revoked if it fails to conform to the criteria required for such status. § 366.7(d).

.WSPP Inc. proposed two structures for the purchase and sale transactions of RECs; (1) RECs that were transferred independently (or unbundled) from energy and (2) RECs that were bundled with energy in the sale transaction. WSPP's only discussion of REC prices considered whether, in the context of RECs bundled with energy, to allocate the contract price between the RECs and energy or to impose a single price, subject to a cap, for both. WSPP ¶¶ 7, 15. WSPP, however, nowhere discussed how RECs themselves were to be priced, and WSPP did not address the price of RECs in transactions where, as here, the sales of RECs were unbundled from the sales of wholesale energy.

. ZECs are available only to energy producers that have historically contributed to clean energy resources in New York, produce zero-emissions electricity, and satisfy other standards. Compl. ¶¶ 67-68; CES Order at 124.
 ↵ 
. Plaintiffs assert that ""[u]nlike New York’s REC program, which is not tethered to the wholesale markets (and which Plaintiffs do not challenge), the ZEC program directly affects wholesale rates.” Opp. 30. Plaintiffs’ distinction between ZECs and RECs hinges on their legal conclusion that ZECs, and not RECs, are ""tethered to the wholesale markets.” The Court rejects Plaintiffs’ purported “tether” for the reasons discussed supra.
 ↵ 
. The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ alleged economic harm is that other generators were awarded ZECs while they were not and that Plaintiffs must compete against the generators receiving ZECs. See Compl. ¶ 74. But that harm exists because Plaintiffs do not produce energy with the environmental attributes encouraged by the ZEC program. That is, Plaintiffs fail to qualify for the ZEC program because of their business decisions about how they generate electricity.
 ↵ 
. Although the Second Circuit did not explicitly discuss whether its discussion of the contracts' effects on wholesale prices was rel*578evant to the field or conflict preemption question, -the Second Circuit, cited Hughes throughout that discussion, which was a field preemption case, Nevertheless, Allco concluded, as a matter of law, that the kind of effect alleged by Allco was an ""incidental effect on wholesale prices.” Allco, 861 F.3d at 101. The Court finds no basis to find that an effect that is ""incidental"" when contemplating field preemption loses its ""incidental” nature when -contemplating conflict preemption.
 ↵ 
. Nazarian II concerned the Maryland program that was struck down in Hughes. The district court denied the motion to dismiss in Nazarian II but later concluded after a bench trial that the Maryland program was field preempted, a decision affirmed by the Fourth Circuit, PPL Energyplus, LLC v. Nazarian, 753 F.3d 467 (4th Cir. 2014), and the Supreme Court, Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, — U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1288, 194 L.Ed.2d 414 (2016).
 ↵ 
, It is difficult to fathom how the ZEC program could cause ""clear damage” to FERC goals inasmuch as FERC has taken no steps to oppose the ZEC program, despite having had several months to do so, and has approved REC programs, which have an identical impact on the market. See WSPP, 139 FERC P 61061, 2012 WL 1395532. The fact that FERC has convened a technical conference ""to understand the potential for sustainable wholesale market designs that both preserve the benefits of regional markets and respect state policies” that encourage particular resource attributes would seem to indicate that FERC concurs with the Court’s conclusion that there is not a conflict between federal goals regarding wholesale market auctions and state policies that incentivize the production of energy with positive environmental attributes. See Notice of Technical Conference at 2, Dkt. 121-1 (FERC Mar. 3, 2017).

. The District Court for the Northern District of California has also'addressed whether Lexmark applies to constitutional claims. In HomeAway Inc. v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, the district court held that Lexmark did not address the prudential doctrine of third-party standing as applied to constitutional claims and declined to extend Lexmark as invalidating that strand of prudential standing doctrine. No. 14-CV-04859-JCS, 2015 WL 367121, at *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 27, 2015). Because third-party interests are not at issue here, the decision in HomeAway is not relevant.

 ↵ 
. In their opposition brief, Plaintiffs did not address Intervenors’ argument that Plaintiffs’ *582dormant Commerce Clause claim should be dismissed because Plaintiffs lack prudential standing, although Plaintiffs did attempt to address the issue in response to the Court's question during oral argument, see Tr. 35:4-39:15. ‘‘[F]ailure to adequately brief an argument constitutes waiver of that argument at [the] motion to dismiss stage.” Guzman v. Macy’s Retail Holdings, Inc., No. 09 CIV. 4472 (PGG), 2010 WL 1222044, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Nevertheless, the Court will consider the merits of the prudential standing issue, albeit reframed as a cause of action issue.
 ↵ 
. At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs represented to the Court that Plaintiff Electric Power Supply Association includes at least one member that is an out-of-state nuclear power plant. Tr. 35:17-25, But, ""[o]n a motion to dismiss, the Court must only examine the allegations in the complaint to determine whether Plaintiff has met the [zone of interests test],” Allocco Recycling, Ltd., 378 F.Supp.2d at 357 (citing Nash v. Califano, 613 F.2d 10, 14 (2d Cir. 1980)). Because the Court holds that even if Plaintiffs had a cause of action, their dormant Commerce Clause claims would fail, it would be futile for Plaintiffs to amend their Complaint to include allegations that they own or represent out-of-state nuclear facilities.
 ↵ 
. The District Court ""for the Northern District of Illinois made a similar point with respect to a dormant Commerce Clause challenge in Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *7, but did so in the context of holding the complaining plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to challenge Illinois’ ZEC program. That district court wrote: ""If the procurement process were non-discriminatory, the out-of-state, non-nuclear plaintiffs would still be injured, Similarly, the general market-distorting effects on non-nuclear plants outside of Illinois would still be felt if the ZEC procurement process subsidized nuclear -plants without favoring in-state interests.” Id,
 ↵ 
. In evaluating whether the plaintiffs had a cause of action under the Copyright Act, the Supreme Court in Lexmark analyzed the zone of interests and proximate cause requirements separately. 134 S.Ct. at 1388-91. The proximate cause analysis is similar to the zone of interests analysis and concerns ""whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits,” Id. at 1390. In other words, “the proximate-cause requirement generally bars suits for alleged harm that is 'too remote’ from the defendant’s unlawful conduct.” Id. For the same reasons that Plaintiffs’ undue burden claim is not within the dormant Commerce Clause’s zone of interests, it also fails to satisfy the proximate cause requirement.
 ↵ 
.Moreover, the Supreme Court has suggested that a less -generous approach may be appropriate outside of the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA”) context. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 134 S.Ct. at 1389 (""[T]he breadth of the zone of interests varies according to the provisions of law at issue, so that what comes within the zone of interests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative action under the ‘generous review provisions’ of the APA may not do so for other purposes,” (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997))).
 ↵ 
. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s dormant Commerce Clause ruling on a different ground without commenting on the district court's analytical approach. The Second Circuit applied General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 117 S.Ct. 811, 136 L.Ed.2d 761 (1997), to conclude that the Connecticut REC program did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause because a REC that satisfies Connecticut’s REC program can be produced only in the Northeast and is thus a different product that does not compete against a REC produced in Georgia. Allco, 861 F.3d at 103-08. The district court’s analytical approach is more applicable here than the Second Circuit’s approach given that the dormant Commerce Clause claim is not that New York is discriminating against a competing product from out-of-state but that New York (1) is not giving ZECs to out-of-state energy producers, and (2) is creating an undue burden on interstate commerce because ZECs distort market pricing and incentives.
 ↵ 
. New York is favoring its own citizens in the ZEC program as it is currently applied because only three power plants currently receive ZECs, and they are all in New York. The parties dispute whether the ZEC program, by requiring nuclear power plants to have been historical providers of energy to New York, effectively limits eligibility to New York nuclear power plants. Compare Defs. Mem. 23, and Intervenors Mem, 23, and Defs. Reply 13-14, with Opp. 37.
 ↵ 
. Courts often apply the market participant exception to dormant Commerce Clause cases concerning subsidies, but because some cases have analyzed whether subsidies violate the dormant Commerce Clause independent of— and without mention of — the market participant exception, this Court also addresses whether ZECs are a permissible subsidy pursuant to those cases, independent of the market participant exception doctrine.
 ↵ 
. Because Plaintiffs lack a cause of action, the market participant exception applies, and the ZEC program is a permissible subsidy, the Court need not reach the parties' arguments regarding whether the ZEC program is facially discriminatory or poses an undue burden. Nevertheless, the Court is skeptical that the ZEC program poses a disparate, undue burden on out-of-state economic interests on the theory, as alleged by Plaintiffs, that ZECs artificially reduce market prices. That alleged harm is not disparate — it affects in-state and out-of-state power plants equally.

Opinion
HUFFMAN, J. 
Plaintiffs and appellants Borrego Water District et al. (Borrego), a group of public entities and retail purchasers of electricity, filed this action for damages and other relief against defendants and respondents AES Corporation et al. (AES), a number of companies and their subsidiaries which are generators, sellers, or traders of electricity at wholesale (defendants). In their master complaint filed in 2002 in these coordinated actions, plaintiffs allege violations of California’s antitrust laws (Bus. & Prof. Code, 1 § 16720; hereafter the Cartwright Act), as well as violations of California’s unfair competition law (§ 17200 et seq.; hereafter the UCL). 2 These allegations all arise out of market conditions and events during the California energy crisis of 2000 and onward, relating to claims for damages and injunctive relief for anticompetitive activity and/or unfair competition in the wholesale electricity market.
In response to the filing of this action, and after a delay of several years due to removal to federal court and remand to state court, all defendants brought and renewed a joint demurrer to the master complaint, on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. Defendants argued the subject matter of the master complaint was preempted by federal law that had occupied the field of wholesale electricity market control and regulation, because plaintiffs’ theories of recovery would inevitably require the superior court to determine reasonable rates for wholesale power sales. Defendants further argued that a regulatory doctrine, the filed rate doctrine, barred the filing of this action for damages. (See Public Utility v. Dynegy Power Marketing (9th Cir. 2004) 384 F.3d 756 (Snohomish); Public Utility, Grays Harbor, WA v. IDACORP (9th Cir. 2004) 379 F.3d 641, 647 (Grays Harbor).) The trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
Plaintiffs appeal, contending the ruling was erroneous because California case law, Younger v. Jensen (1980) 26 Cal.3d 397 [161 Cal.Rptr. 905, 605 P.2d 813] (Younger) and Spielholz v. Superior Court (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1366 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 197] (Spielholz), should support a finding that state law can provide an independent ground for regulation of the anticompetitive or unfair *1299 conduct of defendants, through an award of antitrust damages, such that there should be no finding of federal preemption. Plaintiffs found further support for their theory of general applicability of state antitrust laws in the context of electricity market disputes in the United States Supreme Court case of Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States (1973) 410 U.S. 366 [35 L.Ed.2d 359, 93 S.Ct. 1022] (Otter Tail Power).
Our analysis of the master complaint and pertinent case law convinces us that the trial court correctly applied the doctrines of field and conflict preemption in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. We find additional support for that conclusion in the filed rate doctrine, relied on by the trial court as an alternate ground for its ruling on demurrer. (California ex rel. Lockyer v. Dynegy, Inc. (9th Cir. 2004) 375 F.3d 831, 852-853 (Dynegy).) We affirm the judgment of dismissal.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
A
Master Complaint; Coordinated Proceedings
Since 2001, these coordinated proceedings have included a total of six actions originating both in San Diego and in other counties. Plaintiffs, the People of the State of California (suing through city attorneys) and 21 retail purchasers of electricity, filed their master complaint in 2002. These plaintiffs did not purchase power directly from defendants, which are wholesalers, but rather from several investor-owned utilities, including San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. Although several of the plaintiffs originally sought class certification, those matters were apparently stayed pending the demurrer proceedings and are not before us on this appeal. 3
A number of major named defendant groups have settled this case and are not participants in this appeal (Reliant Energy, Duke Energy, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading, and Mirant Americas Energy, etc.). 4 The remaining defendants, and their subsidiaries for whose activities they are sued, are four *1300 groups of generators, sellers, or traders of electricity at wholesale (Dynegy, Inc.; Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.; AES Corporation; and Sempra Energy, Inc.). 5
Plaintiffs assert a number of alleged violations of the Cartwright Act (first cause of action) and the unfair and/or unlawful prongs of the UCL statute (second and third causes of action), occurring around 2000, during a period of intense governmental and commercial activity to deregulate the electricity markets pursuant to 1996 state legislation, Public Utilities Code section 330 et seq. (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 835 [“Noting the energy industry restructuring already underway, the California Legislature decided that reshaping the market for California energy could help provide competitive, lower cost and reliable electricity service, while preserving the state’s commitment to developing diverse, environmentally sensitive electricity resources. [Citation.] Assembly Bill 1890 (‘AB 1890’) established the legal structure for the deregulation and restructuring plan”].)
In the introductory allegations of the master complaint, plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to recover damages and other equitable and injunctive relief, based on injuries incurred during this period and “arising from defendants’ manipulation, distortion, and corruption of California’s deregulated wholesale electricity market. Defendants’ unfair and unlawful business practices and illegal restraints of trade included combining to withhold supply from electricity markets and colluding to fix electricity prices. This conduct forced electricity users to pay electricity prices based not on competitive market forces, but prices which were grossly inflated due to defendants’ conduct. [][] This action seeks to remedy that conduct, which caused widespread electricity shortages and astronomical prices. Defendants’ manipulation of what was supposed to be a competitive market for wholesale electricity harmed all Californians and destabilized the California economy, which depends on a reliable supply of competitively priced energy. The total harm caused by defendants’ conduct is, at this point, unknown. . . .”
Plaintiffs’ master complaint cites to several examples of defendants’ alleged exploitation of the changes since 1996 in the energy market’s new regulatory and economic structure. These include practices of “conspiring to withhold the supply of energy into the PX and ISO [power exchange and Independent System Operator, nonprofit public benefit corporations established by the Legislature] markets and to manipulate the price at which *1301 wholesale energy was sold.” Plaintiffs allege this constituted “gaming the market” to create false shortages and prevent the sale of electricity at competitive rates. 6
The master complaint describes how the ISO was charged with balancing the supply of energy offered for sale into the market with demand at certain points in time, and was required to purchase energy on the spot market to meet any shortfalls. This spot market was susceptible to manipulation regarding the price of wholesale energy, which was set by the “market clearing price,” or the highest price offered for sale of energy necessary to meet the load. This scheme was supposed to promote competition to attract new sources of power and lower the price of electricity, but according to plaintiffs, it was subject to abuse.
Additionally, defendants’ communications and information sharing were alleged to be made for the purpose of and having the effect of manipulating supply and fixing prices. Defendants “manipulated supply such that the ISO was forced to issue shortage warnings during the Summer of 2000 even though the State had sufficient generating capacity. Defendants accomplished this by withholding supply from the PX and ISO markets, thus creating artificial shortages of electricity which, in turn, raised the market clearing prices on the wholesale energy markets. Much of this withholding was executed by simply shutting down or restricting the output of operational electricity generators. . . . [][] This sort of activity provided the pretext— electricity shortages—for defendants’ collusive and outrageous sales prices offered into the wholesale energy markets operated by the PX and ISO. From their respective trading floors, defendants coordinated the prices for electricity they offered for sale, otherwise known as ‘bid rigging.’ ”
Plaintiffs therefore alleged that defendants’ conduct departed from a competitive model, and they could “wield ‘market power,’ i.e., the ability to control the market price.” This conduct “materially raised electricity prices in the PX and ISO markets, which in turn, resulted in higher retail prices to consumers.” The relief sought included actual and treble damages, restitution, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.
B
Demurrer/Opposition
In June 2005, after remand from federal court, defendants renewed their joint demurrer, asserting a lack of jurisdiction in the superior court, based on *1302 federal preemption, as well as failure to state the causes of action. Defendants asserted plaintiffs’ claims, based on conduct occurring in the wholesale energy market, cannot be adjudicated in state court because that is a field which is regulated by the federal government through the Federal Power Act (FPA; 16 U.S.C. § 791a et seq.) and placed within the exclusive authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Defendants relied on federal case law holding that state law claims arising from wholesale transactions in the interstate electricity market are preempted under the FPA and that the filed rate doctrine applies to rates regulated under the FPA. (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756; Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 647.)
Defendant argued the cases cited by plaintiffs as precluding a finding of preemption, such as Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, and Spielholz, supra, 86 Cal.App.4th 1366, were distinguishable and more limited than plaintiffs believed. Opposition and reply papers were filed, supported by extensive judicially noticeable material from FERC records. 7
At oral argument in the trial court, defendants responded to plaintiffs’ theories with the observation that there were ongoing refund requests before FERC by one of the defendants’ subsidiaries, San Diego Gas & Electric, and defendants contended FERC was the proper forum. Plaintiffs continued to argue that in light of the various changes in the FERC regulatory process, from filed rates to a market-based type of regulation, Congress could not have intended to preempt the field when it enacted the FPA. Plaintiffs relied on Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, to contend concurrent state antitrust regulation in the wholesale market was appropriate, also citing to a related case in which a federal district court judge had observed that it was possible to establish a violation of the Cartwright Act without reference to the FPA’s “ ‘just and reasonable’ ” rates standard. (Hendricks v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. (S.D.Cal 2001) 160 F.Supp.2d 1155, 1163 (Hendricks).) In plaintiffs’ view, it was possible to establish damages for anticompetitive conduct by defendants that were not measured by rate regulation standards. Plaintiffs contended that antitrust damages should be measured by what price the market would have set if anticompetitive forces were not operating, as distinguished from the *1303 FERC standard of a just and reasonable rate, which was tied to how much money defendants were entitled to be making. The matter was taken under submission.
C
Ruling
After oral argument, the trial court issued its order, setting forth its reasoning as follows. First, the court granted the respective requests for judicial notice of rulings and orders issued by FERC. The demurrer was sustained on the basis that all claims were preempted and Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, was distinguishable. The court primarily relied on the authority of a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, to conclude that plaintiffs’ claims and prayer for relief would impermissibly require a “fair price” determination, already found to be barred by preemption principles in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641. The court concluded the field preemption and conflict preemption principles barred each of plaintiffs’ claims.
Further, the trial court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366, would bar a finding of preemption, “because that case concerned federal antitrust laws and not state antitrust laws as Plaintiffs allege in their Master Complaint.” The court further noted that in light of its finding that preemption bars plaintiffs’ claims, it was not required to reach the issue of the applicability of the filed rate doctrine; nevertheless, those principles would bar these claims (relying on, e.g., Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756; Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831). These rulings were dispositive and the master complaint was dismissed.
Plaintiffs, through liaison counsel, timely filed their notice of appeal.
DISCUSSION
The main thrust of the complaint is that defendants’ conduct, their alleged “manipulation, distortion and corruption” of the wholesale electricity market in California, “forced electricity users to pay electricity prices based not on competitive market forces, but prices which were grossly inflated due to defendants’ conduct,” thereby giving rise to an entitlement to antitrust damages and unfair competition remedies in favor of plaintiffs. To avoid the effect of federal preemption in this heavily regulated area, plaintiffs seek to distinguish between the regulatory authority granted to FERC to order compliance with its policies, such as by ordering refunds to electricity *1304 consumers, and the types of damages and other relief recoverable under the Cartwright Act and/or the UCL.
We first set forth rules regarding federal preemption in this factual and legal context. We then address the filed rate doctrine.
I
QUESTIONS OF LAW PRESENTED
To address these issues as resolved on demurrer, we apply basic standards of review. “We review the trial court’s sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend de novo, exercising our independent judgment as to whether a cause of action has been stated as a matter of law. [Citations.] We ‘give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] A judgment based on a dismissal must be affirmed if any of the grounds for demurrer raised by the defendant is well-taken and disposes of the complaint. [Citation.]” (Gallivan v. AT&T Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1381 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 898].)
“When the issues regarding federal preemption involve undisputed facts, it is a question of law whether a federal statute or regulation preempts a state law claim and, on appeal, we independently review a trial court’s determination on that issue of preemption. [Citations.]” (Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1476 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 653] (Smith).)
A preliminary question of law we must address is whether plaintiffs are entitled to claim the benefit of “the general rule disfavoring implied preemption.” (Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. Public Utilities Com. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1303, 1311-1312 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 435] (Southern California Edison).) This is sometimes termed a “presumption against preemption. ‘We apply a presumption against federal preemption unless the state attempts to regulate an area in which there is a history of significant federal regulation.’ [Citation.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 648, fn. 7.) Plaintiffs rely on Smith, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, to argue that the Cartwright Act may provide alternative schemes of regulation of wholesale electricity markets, to the extent that such claims are not inconsistent with federal preemption in this area. They hinge this claim upon their perception that antitrust damages arising from defendants’ anticompetitive conduct are different in nature from any penalties or refunds that FERC might order resulting from the same type of conduct. They argue the party claiming federal preemption (defendants) have the burden to show specific state law claims are preempted. (Smith, supra, at p. 1475.)
*1305 In response, defendants cite to Southern California Edison, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th 1303, to say that the “presumption against preemption” is “characteristically applied where the field is one that the states have traditionally occupied and regulated. [Citation.] The presumption ‘is not triggered when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] Inasmuch as the field of interconnection [wholesale electricity distribution] agreements has a history of significant federal presence, the presumption against preemption is not applicable here.” (Id. at pp. 1311-1312.) We agree with those observations and those of the court in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 648, footnote 7, that “[t]his presumption is almost certainly not applicable here because the federal government has long regulated wholesale electricity rates.”
We therefore seek to examine, free from any such presumption against preemption, the respective merits of the arguments by both plaintiffs and defendants regarding the application of preemption principles here.
n
PREEMPTION PRINCIPLES
As set forth in Smith, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1476, our task is to examine “the precise language of the federal law or regulation to determine whether a particular state law claim is preempted. [Citations.] ‘As to each state law claim, the central inquiry is whether file legal duty that is the predicate of the [claim] constitutes a requirement or prohibition of the sort that federal law expressly preempts. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)
To carry out this analysis of the scope of preemption in the energy/electricity context, we first outline the leading case authority dealing with similar claims arising out of the California energy crisis in the wholesale electricity market, as issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We then compare the nature of the antitrust/UCL damages requested, to the remedial powers allocated by the FPA (16 U.S.C. § 791a) to FERC (formerly the FPC (Federal Power Commission) [see hist. & stat. notes, 16 U.S.C.A. (2000) foll. § 792, p. 78]). We note that although preemption principles are closely intertwined with the “filed rate doctrine,” which is central to FERC’s operations, we may nevertheless discuss them separately. (California ex rel. Lockyer v. F.E.R.C. (9th Cir. 2004) 383 F.3d 1006, 1011 (Lockyer).) The reason is that the historic filed rate doctrine is undergoing fast-paced evolution in the context of energy deregulation, such as the aftermath of the 1996 California legislation with which we are dealing. (Pub. Util. Code, § 330 et seq.; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 852-853.) We will address this evolution to the extent necessary in part III, post.
*1306 Finally, with this background set forth, we will analyze plaintiffs’ arguments that certain alternative federal and state authority shows that antitrust relief in the state courts is not inconsistent with the grant of federal authority to regulate the wholesale electricity market. (E.g., Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397; Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366.)
A
Recent Ninth Circuit Authority
In Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 644, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals built upon earlier authority (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831), to address “contract-related claims against energy wholesalers by a public utility which contends it was forced to pay exorbitant prices for electricity.” (Grays Harbor, supra, at p. 644.) The court upheld a district court dismissal of such contract claims on preemption grounds. It first set forth basic preemption principles: “As an initial matter, it is clear that the Federal Power Act (the ‘FPA’) grants FERC ‘ “exclusive authority to regulate the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce.” ’ [Citations.] Through the FPA, ‘ “Congress meant to draw a bright line easily ascertained, between state and federal jurisdiction. . . . This was done in the Power Act by making [FERC] jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which Congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the States.” ’ [Citation.] This power includes the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates. [Citations.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 646-647.)
In Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 839, the court explained the operation of the ISO tariffs filed with FERC, and said that “the ISO tariff binds the companies to important obligations and duties that are relevant and necessary to the state law claim.” (Ibid.) For example, “the ISO must file schedules showing its rates and charges, and the practices and regulations affecting such charges. [Citation.] The filing enables FERC to determine whether the ISO rules and regulations pertaining to those charges are reasonable, as required by the FPA. [Citation.] Once filed with a federal agency, such tariffs are the ‘equivalent of a federal regulation.’ [Citations.] . . . Besides specifying the generators’ responsibilities, the tariff also details penalties and remedies for non-compliance.” (Ibid.)
Even though the unsuccessful plaintiff in Grays Harbor was claiming contract damages (nominally state law causes of action), the court of appeals read its complaint as seeming, impermissibly, “to require the district court, at some point, to determine the fair price of the electricity that was delivered under the contract. This determination is clearly within FERC’s jurisdiction *1307 for determining the reasonableness of wholesale rates. [Citations.] At the very least, the requested relief intrudes on an ‘identifiable portion’ of a field that the federal government has occupied and addresses a matter that is ‘in any way regulated by the federal government.’ [Citation.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d at p. 648.)
The court of appeals also rejected the plaintiff’s claim that “market-based rates are not within FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction over wholesale rates.” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 649.) The federal court acknowledged that FERC had changed its policies from requiring filed rates to allowing market-based rates. However, traditional preemption principles continue to apply because, “by asking the court to set a fair price, Grays Harbor is invoking a state rule (specifically, contract law) that would interfere with the method by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goals (specifically, FERC regulation of wholesale electricity rates). To permit Grays Harbor to receive in its court action what is essentially a refund would create a conflict with FERC’s authority over wholesale rates. And such a result would make state law stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress under the FPA.” (Id. at p. 650, fn. omitted.) The court ruled the contract claims would interfere with FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction to set wholesale rates and were barred by field preemption, conflict preemption, and the filed rate doctrine. (Id. at pp. 648, 650, 651.)
In the next case, Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, the court extended the reasoning in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, from the contract field to the antitrust field. The federal court found that preemption rules applied to preclude a California state law antitrust court action that was essentially challenging market-based rates. The court explained its reasoning: “The fundamental question in this case is whether, under the market-based system of setting wholesale electricity rates, FERC is doing enough regulation to justify federal preemption of state laws. The answer to this question is controlled by two recent decisions of this court: Dynegy, [supra,] 375 F.3d 831, and Grays Harbor, [supra,] 379 F.3d 641. Under the system at issue here, FERC has waived many of the requirements that applied under the cost-based system. For example, the actual prices are no longer filed with FERC 60 days before they can be charged and the utilities do not provide FERC with detailed schedules of their costs. Instead, the price of wholesale electricity is determined in the markets operated by the PX and the ISO. [f] FERC continued to oversee wholesale electricity rates, however, by reviewing and approving a variety of documents filed by the defendants, the PX, and the ISO.” (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, 760, italics added.)
*1308 The federal court of appeals then gave several examples of how FERC was continuing to exercise its regulatory power to a sufficient degree to justify continued federal preemption. These included considering applications for approval of market-based tariffs upon a showing that the seller lacked or had mitigated its market power; requiring power sellers to file quarterly reports, which contained certain required information including the minimum and maximum rate charged and the total amount of power delivered during the quarter; and reviewing “detailed tariffs filed by the PX and the ISO, which described in detail how the markets operated by each entity would function.” (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, 761.)
Next, the court in Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, described how FERC had taken action to order wholesalers to disgorge profits that resulted from the anticompetitive practices involved in that particular case. From all of these factors, the federal court decided that preemption-related doctrines would continue to apply when market-based rates are involved, as laid out in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641. (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d at pp. 760-761.) Even though Grays Harbor was a contract case, the same reasoning applied to the claims by Snohomish, alleging violations of state antitrust and unfair competition law. The court concluded that both types of claims sought to have the district court “determine the rates that ‘would have been achieved in a competitive market.’ This is the same determination as the ‘fair price’ determination that we held was barred by preemption principles in Grays Harbor. We therefore hold that Snohomish’s claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine, by field preemption, and by conflict preemption.” (Snohomish, supra, at p. 761.) The plaintiff’s proper course of action was to apply to FERC to redress its claims that the prices in the wholesale electricity markets were not just and reasonable or that the defendants sold electricity in violation of the filed tariffs. Snohomish’s state antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. (Id. at p. 762.)
B
Nature of Remedies: FERC Regulatory Scheme/Antitrust Damages
Notwithstanding the above authority, plaintiffs contend that they may continue to pursue their claims for relief, damages pursued under the Cartwright Act and the UCL (alleging unlawful or unfair conduct), as alternative theories of recovery. However, in their reply brief, plaintiffs appear to admit that injunctive relief is not available, although their position is unclear. In any case, in Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, the court noted *1309 such injunctive relief has been held to be barred in this context by preemption principles, as well as the filed rate doctrine. (Id. at pp. 761-762; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d at pp. 849-853.) Ninth Circuit cases have held that injunctive relief under the UCL in this context of energy regulation is preempted, because it would “ ‘encroach[] upon the substantive provisions of the tariff, an area reserved exclusively to FERC, both to enforce and to seek remedy.’ ” (Snohomish, supra, at p. 762; see Dynegy, supra, at pp. 836, 852.)
We therefore focus upon plaintiffs’ remaining claims for antitrust damages for the defendants’ anticompetitive conduct. “[T]he central purpose of the antitrust laws, state and federal, is to preserve competition. It is competition—not the collusive fixing of prices at levels either low or high—that these statutes recognize as vital to the public interest.” (Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc. (9th Cir. 2000) 232 F.3d 979, 988 (Knevelbaard).)
Plaintiffs’ arguments require a comparison of antitrust relief to the remedies available from FERC under the FPA. One of the elements of standing to seek antitrust damages for anticompetitive conduct is a sufficient showing of injury with respect to: “ ‘(1) the nature of the plaintiff’s alleged injury; that is, whether it was the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall; (2) the directness of the injury; (3) the speculative measure of the harm; (4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and (5) the complexity in apportioning damages.’ ” (Knevelbaard, supra, 232 F.3d 979, 987.) A court must “ ‘evaluate the plaintiff’s harm, the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants, and the relationship between them.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.; see Kolling v. Dow Jones & Co. (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 709, 723 [187 Cal.Rptr. 797] [antitrust standing is required under the Cartwright Act].)
It is well accepted that damages awards in antitrust cases may not be based upon “sheer guesswork or speculation.” (Suburban Mobile Homes, Inc. v. AMFAC Communities, Inc. (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 532, 545 [161 Cal.Rptr. 811].) Rather, a plaintiff seeking such damages must establish to a reasonable probability that there was some causal connection between defendant’s wrongful act and the damages alleged, such as lost profits. (Ibid.) “Once that has been accomplished, the jury will be permitted to act upon probable and inferential proof and to ‘make a just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data, and render its verdict accordingly.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs say they can prove an entitlement to antitrust damages in state court, on the basis that the injuries they sustained as consumers from the *1310 anticompetitive acts of defendants are mainly unrelated to FERC’s normal duties of regulating rates and tariffs for the delivery of electricity on a wholesale basis. Plaintiffs believe they can show all the elements of “antitrust injury,” i.e., “ ‘(1) unlawful conduct, (2) causing an injury to the plaintiff, (3) that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful, and (4) that is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.’ ” (Knevelbaard, supra, 232 F.3d 979, 987.) Plaintiffs believe that the injury they allege is distinct from the high energy prices allegedly caused by defendants’ actions in creating collusive supply, demand, and price manipulation. They say their claims “are based on duties and obligations that arise entirely independently of any ‘tariff’ relevant to this case.” However, they admit that if FERC were to award any refunds, these would have to be offset against any court award of antitrust or UCL damages, and vice versa.
Defendants rely on the FPA statutory scheme as preempting the field, according to the basic principles explained in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1011, as follows: “The Federal Power Act governs the transmission and wholesale sales of electrical energy in interstate commerce. [Citation.] Pursuant to its authority under the FPA, FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over interstate wholesale power rates. [Citations.] The FPA requires that all rates for the transmission and sale of wholesale electricity be filed with FERC and published for public review. [Citation.] FERC is obligated to ensure that wholesale power rates are ‘just and reasonable,’ [citation], and applied in a non-discriminatory manner, [citations]. Indeed, FERC’s authority to determine whether wholesale rates are ‘just and reasonable’ is exclusive. [Citation.]” (Lockyer, supra, at p. 1011.) As explained in Dynegy, the wholesale producers’ filings will enable FERC “to determine whether the ISO rules and regulations pertaining to those charges are reasonable, as required by the FPA. [Citation.] Once filed with a federal agency, such tariffs are the ‘equivalent of a federal regulation.’ [Citations.]” (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d at p. 839.)
Defendants accordingly argue that the FPA preempts this field and requires that any such relief be requested from FERC, such as refunds to purchasers. They point to 16 United States Code section 824d(a) et seq., providing that FERC is charged with regulating and disclosing “just and reasonable rates” as follows: “All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.” (16 U.S.C. § 824d(a).) Likewise, in 16 United States Code section 824d(c), FERC is authorized to *1311 require public utilities to file and disclose “schedules showing all rates and charges for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such rates and charges, together with all contracts which in any manner affect or relate to such rates, charges, classifications, and services.”
FERC also has the power under 16 United States Code section 824e(a) to prohibit “[u]njust or preferential rates, etc.” and to order remedies as follows: “Whenever the Commission, after a hearing held upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affected such rate, charge, or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order.” In 16 United States Code section 824e(b), the commission is entitled to prescribe the effective dates of refunds that it orders. We believe the broad scope of these statutes must invoke the rule that antitrust damages will not be proper where there is a risk of duplicative recovery. The nature of plaintiffs’ alleged injury (equivalent to an entitlement to refunds) is apparently inseparable from the type of injury the antitrust laws were intended to forestall. (Knevelbaard, supra, 232 F.3d 979, 987.)
Plaintiffs, however, offer several reasons why these applications of preemption theory were wrongly decided or distinguishable from their claims, as we next discuss.
C
Alternative Approaches Relied on by Plaintiffs to Preclude a Preemption Finding
Plaintiffs rely on California law (Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397; Spielholz, supra, 86 Cal.App.4th 1366) to argue no federal preemption principles apply here. They also cite to Otter Tail Power, as representing the concept that activities coming under the jurisdiction of a regulatory agency “nevertheless may be subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws.” (Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366, 372.) Plaintiffs seemingly argue for a “back to basics” approach to preemption, based on this older case law focusing on congressional intent. Further, they point to language in the Lockyer opinion (Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006) as showing that the federal courts here recognized that FERC is not doing a good enough job, such that alternative remedies should *1312 now be allowed through this state antitrust action. We discuss these theories in turn.
In Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, the court explained that an agency such as the FPC (now FERC) must take antitrust considerations into account when it determines “ ‘public interest’ ” and “ ‘public convenience and necessity,’ ” but the agency “has ‘no power to insulate utilities under its regulation from the operation of the antitrust acts, or to determine when an antitrust violation has taken place. Otter Tail Power[, supra,) 410 U.S. 366, 93 S.Ct. 1022, 35 L.Ed.2d 359 . . . .’ [Citations.]” (Younger, supra, at pp. 407-408.) The Supreme Court decided that a parallel piece of legislation, the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. § 717 et seq.), did not preclude the state Attorney General from investigating possible violations of California antitrust law. It reasoned that the act did not expressly prohibit investigation or other activity regarding state antitrust laws, and that such practices could be consistent with the federal counterparts. (Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d at p. 408.) The Supreme Court therefore found no federal preemption of the state Attorney General’s investigation of alleged conduct such as “ ‘price fixing, monopolization, divisions of markets, and restraint of trade,’ ” and said “[hypothetical conflict between federal law and enforcement of California antitrust provisions within the scope of the investigation, even if assumed, is not ground for preemption since it may never arise in fact. [Citations.]” (Ibid.) Instead, state investigations into possible violations of California statutes that were in harmony with federal antitrust laws were deemed to be permissible and not preempted. (Id. at p. 409.)
Plaintiffs argue the authority of Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, 409, is not restricted to authorizing state antitrust investigation procedures, but should also extend to authorizing state antitrust enforcement actions, such as this complaint. We disagree, because more than a “[hypothetical conflict between federal law and enforcement of California antitrust provisions” (id. at p. 408) is present here, in light of the extensive nature of the FERC regulatory scheme over the wholesale electricity market. In the FPA, we are presented with “ ‘ “a bright line easily ascertained, between state and federal jurisdiction. . . . This was done in the Power Act by making [FERC] jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which Congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the States.” ’ [Citations.] This power includes the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates. [Citations.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 646-647.) Plaintiffs cannot explain why the trial court would not have to second-guess FERC rate determinations in fixing antitrust damages to punish defendants for the alleged anticompetitive conduct, because such conduct would directly affect the reasonableness of the rates charged.
*1313 In the UCL context, in Spielholz, supra, 86 Cal.App.4th 1366, those plaintiffs were allowed to proceed with false advertising allegations that a telecommunications carrier had falsely advertised a “seamless calling area” existed, where in reality, there were gaps where wireless telephone users were unable to connect calls. The Court of Appeal found no federal preemption of such claims, because the main allegations dealt with false advertising, such that any effect on rates was merely incidental. Here, however, as stated by the trial court, “This can be contrasted to the instant case, involving the FPA, where Plaintiffs’ allegations concern conduct directly related to rates charged and ultimately paid.” We agree with the trial court’s analyses of the California case law claims, because plaintiffs have been unable to show why the alleged anticompetitive conduct by defendants inflicted any different kind of injury on them, that is separate from the rates charged and ultimately paid. This is not a case in which incidental damages are claimed to arise from conduct that is not covered by the federal legislation, such as false advertising.
In its ruling, the trial court also rejected the argument that Otter Tail Power would bar a finding of preemption, since that case concerned federal antitrust laws and not state antitrust laws. There, the Supreme Court relied on legislative history to find nothing in the FPA that would “insulate electric power companies from the operation of the antitrust laws.” (Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366, 374-375.) Rather, to the extent that voluntary business relationships are utilized to control the interstate distribution of power (as opposed to governmental regulation), “courts must be hesitant to conclude that Congress intended to override the fundamental national policies embodied in the antitrust laws.” (Ibid.) The court in Otter Tail Power held there is no basis to conclude that the limited power granted to the FPC/FERC to regulate certain aspects of electrical supply (e.g., ordering interconnections of power lines) “was intended to be a substitute for, or to immunize Otter Tail from, antitrust regulation for refusing to deal with municipal corporations.” (Ibid.) This authority is distinguishable because these plaintiffs are attempting to claim injury by invoking the same subject matter covered by the government regulatory authority, but recharacterizing it as antitrust injury, all the while seeking to recover damages for overcharged payments and allegedly excessive rates. This is a distinction without a difference.
Plaintiffs next argue that the authority of MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. (1994) 512 U.S. 218 [129 L.Ed.2d 182, 114 S.Ct. 2223] and Maislin Industries, U. S. v. Primary Steel (1990) 497 U.S. 116 [111 L.Ed.2d 94, 110 S.Ct. 2759] should indicate that the kind of market-based tariffs that are in use here are not properly regulated solely by the FPA and FERC. In Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1013, the court of appeals summarized and distinguished those same holdings in a closely analogous factual context (regulatory challenges by the state to the actions of *1314 the federal agency). The court explained the nature of these different market-based regulatory schemes as follows: “In MCI, the Supreme Court held that the FCC could not eliminate rate-filing requirements for any class of carrier, even when necessary to promote competitive markets. In Maislin, the Court held that the ICC could not allow common carriers to charge unfiled, privately negotiated rates lower than the filed rates, even when the carriers were in highly competitive markets. [Citation.] As the Court stated in Maislin, the existence of a competitive market ‘cannot provide the ICC authority to alter well-established statutory filed rate requirements.’ [Citation.]” (Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d at p. 1013.) The court of appeals then distinguished the FERC regulatory scheme from those schemes, in the course of rejecting an argument that the FERC procedures were fatally defective: “The agencies in MCI and Maislin relied on market forces alone in approving market-based tariffs. In contrast, FERC’s system consists of a finding that the applicant lacks market power (or has taken sufficient steps to mitigate market power), coupled with strict reporting requirements to ensure that the rate is ‘just and reasonable’ and that markets are not subject to manipulation. Here, FERC required the wholesale seller to file a market analysis every four months, and quarterly reports summarizing its transactions during the preceding three months. These transaction summaries include both long and short-term contracts, purportedly with reports of some sales for intervals as small as ten minutes. FERC has affirmed in its presentation before us that it is not contending that approval of a market-based tariff based on market forces alone would comply with the FPA or the filed rate doctrine. Rather, the crucial difference between MCI/Maislin and the present circumstances is the dual requirement of an ex ante finding of the absence of market power and sufficient post-approval reporting requirements. Given this, FERC argues that its market-based tariff does not run afoul of MCI or Maislin, and we agree.” (Ibid., italics added.)
Plaintiffs have provided no reason to depart from the above analysis, and disregard the fact that the FPA includes certain safeguards to oversee the reasonableness of rates for the wholesale electricity market. It does not make any difference that in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1013, the court of appeals reached those conclusions but nevertheless went on to criticize the regulatory efforts of FERC as “abdicating its regulatory responsibility.” (Id. at pp. 1014—1015.) At that time, the court of appeals accepted the argument that “even if market-based tariffs are lawful in concept, FERC failed to administer the tariffs in accordance with their terms and abused its discretion in limiting available remedies for regulatory violations.” (Id. at p. 1014.) Specifically, in Lockyer, the court found fault with FERC’s past policies as follows. First, it had implemented market-based tariffs so as to virtually deregulate the wholesale electricity industry and remove it from statutorily required oversight, but without providing appropriate safeguards, such as “enforceable *1315 post-approval reporting that would enable FERC to determine whether the rates were ‘just and reasonable’ and whether market forces were truly determining the price.” (Ibid.) Second, these crucial transactional reporting requirements were not followed during the subject time period: “Indeed, non-compliance with FERC’s reporting requirements was rampant throughout California’s energy crisis. FERC itself has acknowledged that during the height of the energy crisis the quarterly reports of several major wholesalers failed to include the transaction-specific data through which the agency at least theoretically could have monitored the California energy market .... [f] . . . fit] Thus, the very mechanism that distinguished FERC’s tariff from those prohibited by the Supreme Court in MCI and Maislin was, for all practical purposes, non-existent while energy prices skyrocketed and rolling brown-outs threatened California’s businesses and citizens.” (Ibid.)
Notwithstanding those past institutional failures on the part of FERC, the court of appeals in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, acknowledged that FERC possessed “broad remedial authority to address anti-competitive behavior” (id. at p. 1015), such as ordering reftmds in instances where utilities violated FPA provisions (exceeding approved rates or charging unapproved rates; FPA, § 205, 16 U.S.C. § 824d). 8 FERC can also order profits to be disgorged when a regulated utility fails to comply with requirements for posting rates and nondiscrimination requirements. Such remedial power (e.g., the power to order retroactive refunds) “is inherent in FERC’s authority to approve a market-based tariff in the first instance.” (Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d at pp. 1015-1016.) This result was required in order to avoid having only an illusory remedy available from FERC under a market-based tariff system. The court of appeals therefore returned the matter to FERC “to reconsider its remedial options in the first instance.” (Id. at p. 1018.)
Plaintiffs interpret all these authorities as showing that state antitrust regulation should be allowed in this instance, to fill the gaps left when FERC scaled back its activities and abdicated its regulatory responsibilities. We cannot agree, because even considering its difficult history, FERC has been provided with sufficient regulatory authority such that federal preemption principles must be applied to these antitrust/UCL challenges arising from wholesale electricity market activities. Plaintiffs acknowledge that FERC refunds are a potential remedy and offset for their claims. Moreover, they have been unable to show how any damages from defendants’ conduct, recoverable under an antitrust theory, would be separate in nature from the allegedly overpaid rates that they paid for power, which would also give rise to any refund requests. The authority of Hendricks, supra, 160 F.Supp.2d, 1155, 1163 (decided in 2001), regarding permissible concurrent theories of *1316 relief, lacks persuasiveness in light of more recent case law such as Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756 and Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641 (decided in 2004). 9 Similarly, although plaintiffs rely on Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397 to contend concurrent state antitrust regulation in the wholesale market is appropriate, that case has not been extended beyond its facts pertaining to permissible investigations regarding matters within antitrust state jurisdiction, and this is not the right case to do so. (Id. at pp. 406-409.)
Plaintiffs’ attempts to rely on fundamental case law from the 1970’s and 1980’s are unsuccessful because they cannot bring themselves within those general exceptions to well-established preemption principles. Rather, the logic of the recent Ninth Circuit authority in this area is persuasive and should be followed here. (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756.) The trial court properly sustained the demurrers on preemption grounds.
Ill
EFFECT OF FILED RATE DOCTRINE
The trial court’s ruling stated that in light of its finding that federal preemption bars plaintiffs’ claims, it was not required to reach the issue of the applicability of the filed rate doctrine. However, it concluded those principles would nevertheless bar these claims (relying on, e.g., Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756; Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 851-853). All these issues have been fully briefed on appeal. Although the preemption ground alone would provide a sufficient basis to uphold the ruling on demurrer, in an abundance of caution, we will also address the closely related filed rate doctrine issues. Commentators have referred to this line of case law as applying and/or conflating the filed rate doctrine together with field and conflict preemption. (Cal. Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 2005 supp.) § 7.06, p. 41.)
“ ‘At its most basic, the filed rate doctrine provides that state law, and some federal law (e.g. antitrust law), may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question.’ [Citations.] ‘[T]he filed rate doctrine has prohibited not just a state court (or a federal court applying state law) from setting a rate different from that chosen by FERC, but also from assuming a hypothetical rate different from that actually set by FERC.’ ” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 650-651.)
*1317 Also in Grays Harbor, the court addressed contemporary concerns that application of “the filed rate doctrine to market-based rates that have not been filed with FERC would be an unwise and unprecedented expansion of the doctrine.” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 651.) The court found no such barrier to the use of this doctrine, for the following reasons: “[T]he market-based rate regime established by FERC continues FERC’s oversight of the rates charged. FERC only permits power sales at market-based rates after scrutinizing whether ‘the seller and its affiliates do not have, or have adequately mitigated, market power in generation and transmission and cannot erect other barriers to entry.’ [Citation.] According to FERC, these conditions assure that the market-based rates charged comply with the FPA’s requirement that rates be just and reasonable. [Citations.] This oversight is ongoing . ... [][]... Further, FERC contends that such procedures effectively constitute review of rates prior to their implementation. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) FERC also has a remedies provision regarding refunds in 16 United States Code section 824e(a) and (b).
Based on those factors, the court of appeals stated that “while market-based rates may not have historically been the type of rate envisioned by the filed rate doctrine, we conclude that they do not fall outside of the purview of the doctrine.” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 651.) Although this analysis of the evolution of this regulatory method is very general in nature, it is nevertheless persuasive and we have been given no reason to depart from it here. Instead, the allegations of the master complaint amount to requests for penalties for alleged anticompetitive conduct by defendants, and these potentially would interfere with FERC supervision of market-based rates and any enforcement activities allowed under FERC procedures. We are reluctant to engage in policy analysis to the extent that plaintiffs request in this fast-changing and highly regulated area.
Moreover, in light of these conclusions, we need not address in detail plaintiffs’ limitations argument, that FERC was without jurisdiction as to conduct occurring prior to October 2, 2000, due to its own rulings about its assertion of jurisdiction as depending on the timing of events giving rise to claims filed. We find the filed rate doctrine to be instructive in this context and conclude that it reinforces our conclusions regarding preemption. (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d at pp. 852-853; Entergy La., Inc. v. Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n (2003) 539 U.S. 39, 47 [156 L.Ed.2d 34, 123 S.Ct. 2050] [filed rate doctrine may apply to state regulators through federal preemption under the supremacy clause].) The trial court correctly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on this ground as well.
*1318 DISPOSITION
The judgment of dismissal is affirmed. Plaintiffs are to pay the ordinary costs on appeal.

Sections 17200 through 17209 are commonly referred to as the unfair competition law or UCL. (Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 558, fn. 2 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].)

Certain of the plaintiffs, public officials whom we denote the Bustamante group, do not join in the antitrust claims but make additional UCL claims based on Penal Code violations. (Pen. Code, §§ 395, 396.) The same basic theories pertain to all the causes of action and we need not discuss these additional distinctions separately.
↵ 4
Apparently, those settlements with those other defendants also included other related claims, and are not informative with regard to the issues on this appeal.
↵ 5
In addition to suing these four major employers in the business of wholesale electric trading and marketing, plaintiffs named three individual defendants, who were management employees of the Dynegy group. No separate allegations are made about the individual defendants and we refer to all defendants collectively.
↵ 6
The ISO continues to manage the wholesale electricity market, but the PX is no longer in operation. Plaintiffs’ allegations relate to the period during which the PX was still participating in the market.
↵ 7
Plaintiffs appropriately request judicial notice on appeal of various FERC proceedings and decisions in the record, outlining the scope of its jurisdiction as granted by the FPA (16 U.S.C. § 791a et seq.). These orders and decisions deal with rate schedules and proposed market-based rates and tariffs, and are submitted by plaintiffs to provide examples of FERC’s duties to review whether rates and rate-related practices are just and reasonable, and to provide remedies for violations. (16 U.S.C. §§ 824d, 824e.) We need not discuss several of plaintiffs’ arguments made below, which are not pursued on appeal, such as the purported distinction between the roles of sellers and other participants in the market, such that “at a minimum the case should proceed against traders and generators.”
↵ 8
The FPA, § 205, cited in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1015-1016, is now codified at 16 United States Code section 824d. (U.S.C.A. Tables, vol. I, p. 251.)
↵ 9
See also T & E Pastorino v. Duke Energy Trading (9th Cir. 2005) 123 Fed.Appx. 813, holding UCL allegations regarding transactions in the wholesale energy market fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of FEA, where tariffs approved by FERC would provide the context for determination of any violations of the UCL.

Elster Electricity LLC (“Elster”) appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, granting summary judgment of invalidity for lack of enablement of U.S. Patent No. 5,457, 621 (“the ’621 patent”) in favor of defendant Schlumbergersema Inc. (“Schlumberger”). ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR (D.Del. Sept. 17, 2003). Schlumberger conditionally cross-appeals the district court’s decision granting summary judgment of literal infringement of the ’621 patent. Because the district court did not err in finding that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were not enabled, we affirm the grant of summary

In the above transformer, current flowing through the first winding causes energy to build in the transformer, which is then transferred to the second winding to produce the output voltage of the power supply. Id. at col. 6, 11. 55-65. At the same time current is transferred to the secondary winding, current is also transferred from the transformer to the third winding in order to power the connected control circuitry. Id. at col. 6,11. 65-66.
In February 2001, Elster filed suit against Schlumberger, alleging that Schlumberger’s Vectron product infringed the ’621 patent. Schlumberger cross-claimed for a declaration of invalidity and judgment of invalidity. We do not reach the merits of Schlumberger’s conditional cross-appeal.
I. BACKGROUND
Elster, formerly know as ABB Automation Inc., owns the ’621 patent. The ’621 patent is directed to the power supply of an electrical energy meter for metering electrical energy supplied by an electrical service provider. ’621 patent, col. 1, 11. 63-65. The ’621 patent teaches a power supply including a transformer having first (primary), second (secondary), and third (tertiary or bootstrap) windings. Id. at col. 2, 11. 38-39. The following is a simplified diagram illustrating the power supply:
non-infringement of the ’621 patent. Elster moved for summary judgment of literal infringement and validity with respect to the asserted claims of the ’621 patent. Schlumberger responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’621 patent. In March 2003, the district court granted Elster’s motion for summary judgment that Schlumberger literally infringed claims 1, 2, and 13 of the ’621 patent. ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR (D.Del. Mar. 27, 2003) (order). The district court further granted Schlumberger’s motion for summary judgment that the asserted claims of *916the ’621 patent were invalid for lack of enablement, while denying Elster’s cross motion. Id. On September 17, 2003, the district court entered final judgment.
Elster timely appealed. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).
II. ANALYSIS
A. Standard of Review
“We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.” Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp., 299 F.3d 1313, 1323 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). Summary judgment is only appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); SRI Int’l v. Matsushita Elec. Corp., 775 F.2d 1107, 1116 (Fed.Cir. 1985) (en banc). Claim construction is a question of law we review de novo. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1451 (Fed.Cir.1998). “Enablement is a question of law with factual underpinnings; this court reviews the ultimate legal conclusion without deference.” CFMT, Inc. v. Yieldup Int’l Corp., 349 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2003).
B. Main Appeal
Elster appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment that the ’621 patent is invalid for lack of enablement. The parties primarily dispute the correctness of the district court’s construction of “in response to” in claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent. The district court construed the phrase “a controller ... generating said control signal in response to the output of said power supply” to require that “the controller generates the control signal based on a direct reaction from the second winding.” ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR, slip op. at 3 (D.Del. Mar. 27, 2003) (claim construction order). The district court then found the ’621 patent invalid for lack of enablement, pointing out that although the claim requires that the controller directly respond to the second winding, the specification only enables a controller that responds to the third winding. ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR, slip op. at 10 (D.Del. Mar. 27, 2003) (memorandum opinion).
Elster argues that the district court’s claim construction is not in accordance with the plain and ordinary meaning of “in response to.” Specifically, Elster contends that the claim should be construed to cover a controller that generates a control signal in reaction to the output of the power supply, i.e., an indirect reaction to the output of the second winding, as reflected in the output of the third winding. Elster contends that an indirect response by the third winding to the second winding of the transformer is enabled by the specification. Schlumberger points out that even if the claim is construed to include an indirect and a direct response to the second winding, the written description must enable both. Schlumberger contends that under this construction, the summary judgment for invalidity was appropriate because the claim covers the third winding’s direct response to the second winding, and the written description fails to enable such a direct response.
Claim 1 of the ’621 patent provides:
1. A power supply for use in apparatus for electronically measuring or distributing electrical energy, said electrical energy defining an input voltage, said power supply comprising: *917a transformer comprising first and second windings, wherein said input voltage is provided to said first winding so that current flows through said first winding, wherein said second winding defines the output of said power supply; a switching member connected to said first winding, for permitting and preventing the flow of current through said first winding, wherein said switching member is operable in response to a control signal;
a controller connected to said switching member and to a third winding of said transformer, for generating said control signal in response to the output of said power supply; and
a voltage blocking clamp, connected to said transformer and said switching member, wherein said input voltage is applied to said voltage blocking clamp, for limiting and blocking the voltage applied to said transformer, said voltage blocking clamp comprising first and second transistors and biasing means connected to said first and second transistors, wherein said biasing means biases said first and second transistors so that the voltage provided by said voltage clocking clamp does not exceed a desired level.
’621 patent, col. 10, ll. 31-58 (emphases added). The claim recites that the “controller connected ... to a third winding” of the transformer responds “to the output of said power supply.” Id. at col. 10, ll. 45-48. The claim also recites that “the output of said power supply” is defined by the second winding. Id. at col. 10, ll. 35-39. Therefore, in order to have the controller respond to the output of the power supply, the signal in the third winding must be responsive to the signal in the second winding. The district court appeared to recognize this principle by construing the claim limitation “in response to” to require the third winding directly respond to the second winding. However, this claim construction is unduly restrictive because the claim encompasses any response — either direct or indirect — by the third winding to the second winding. Nonetheless, claims 1 and 13 are not enabled because the written description fails to teach any response between the third and second windings.
Section 112, paragraph 1 of Title 35 U.S.C. states:
The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same....
35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 1 (2000). Patent claims that are not enabled by the specification are invalid. See, e.g., AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac and Ugine, 344 F.3d 1234, 1245 (Fed.Cir.2003).
The power supply is described in the ’621 patent specification as follows:
At the end of each cycle, transistor 302 turns off and allows the energy stored in the core of transformer 300 to flow to the output of the power supply, which “output” can be generally defined by secondary [winding] 312. Simultaneously, energy flows out of the bootstrap or tertiary winding 314 to power the control circuitry 304.
’621 patent, col. 6, ll. 61-66. This passage states that both the second and third windings of the transformer are responsive to the energy stored in the transformer by the first winding. However, this passage does not teach that the third winding is responsive to the second winding. Moreover, the specification teaches away from the third winding responding to the second winding, by stating that insulation between the second and third windings is desirable *918to prevent interference between the two windings:
Any leakage inductance between the bootstrap [third] winding ... and the output [second] winding ... causes inaccurate tracking between the voltage on capacitor 332 and the output voltage of the supply. This leakage inductance can cause poor load regulation of the supply. ... Since the two windings are in direct contact, the bootstrap winding requires Teflon insulation to meet the isolation voltage specification.
Id. at col. 8, ll. 25-35. The passage teaches that interactions between the second and third windings are undesirable. Elster points to nothing in the specification that enables a response by the third winding to the second winding — either directly or indirectly. While the written description makes clear that both the second and third windings respond to signals in the first winding and to that extent are interrelated, the claim calls for the third winding to be responsive to, not merely representative of, signals in the second winding. Because the written description fails to teach a response between the second and third windings, the district court correctly concluded that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were not enabled.
C. Cross-Appeal
Because we find that the district court correctly found that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were not enabled, we do not reach the merits of the district court’s grant of summary judgment that Schlumberger literally infringed the ’621 patent. See, e.g., Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Faulding Inc., 230 F.3d 1320, 1329-30 (Fed.Cir.2000) (“Because we have upheld the district court’s determination that the asserted claims of the ... patent are invalid, it is unnecessary to address [the appellee’s] cross-appeal from the district court’s finding of infringement.”).
III. CONCLUSION
Because the district court correctly granted summary judgment that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were invalid for lack of enablement, we affirm.
