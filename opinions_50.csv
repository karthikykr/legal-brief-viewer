                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA


    PATRICIA L. BAKER

          v.                                                  Civil No. 23-2013 (CKK)

                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION
                                      (July 26, 2024)

         Plaintiff Patricia Baker, proceeding pro se, filed a Complaint against Defendant Google

LLC (“Google”), seeking $2,500,000 after Defendant disabled her Google account due to the

presence of Child Sexual Abuse Material (“CSAM”). Plaintiff asserts that Defendant is liable for

breach of contract, fraud, violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United

States Constitution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Now pending before the

Court is Defendant’s [8] Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

12(b)(6). Upon consideration of the pleadings, the attachments thereto,1 the relevant legal

authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court shall GRANT Defendant’s [8] Motion to

Dismiss and shall DISMISS this case without prejudice.




1
    The Court’s consideration has focused on the following documents:
      • Plaintiff’s Complaint (“Compl.”), ECF No. 1-2;
      • Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (“Def.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 8;
      • Plaintiff’s Motion in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), ECF
         No. 10; and
      • Defendant’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant Google LLC’s Motion to
         Dismiss (“Def.’s Reply”), ECF No. 11.

                                                 1
                                         I. BACKGROUND

        For the purposes of the Motion before the Court, the Court accepts as true the allegations

in Plaintiff’s Complaint. The Court does “not accept as true, however, the plaintiff's legal

conclusions or inferences that are unsupported by the facts alleged.” Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on

Foreign Inv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Plaintiff proceeds in this matter pro se.

Complaints filed by pro se litigants are held to less stringent standards than those applied to

formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972); Brown v.

District of Columbia, 514 F.3d 1279, 1283 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Additionally, the Court must

consider not only the facts alleged in Plaintiff's Complaint, but also the facts alleged in Plaintiff’s

briefs filed in response to the Motions to Dismiss. See Brown v. Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc.,

789 F.3d 146, 152 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“[A] district court errs in failing to consider a pro

se litigant's complaint ‘in light of’ all filings, including filings responsive to a motion to

dismiss.”) (quoting Richardson v. United States, 193 F.3d 545, 548 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); Fillmore v.

AT&T Mobility Servs. LLC, 140 F. Supp. 3d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2015) (JEB) (“The Court, as it must in

a case brought by a pro se plaintiff, considers the facts as alleged in both the Complaint and

Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.”). The Court recites only the

background necessary for the Court’s resolution of the pending Motion to Dismiss.

        Plaintiff was denied access to her Google account, patricia.baker500@gmail.com, in or

around March 2023. Compl. at 2, 8. Plaintiff received a notification explaining why Defendant

disabled her account. See id. at 8. This notification stated: “It looks like this account has content

that involves a child being sexually abused or exploited. This is a severe violation of Google’s

policies and might be illegal.” Id. Plaintiff denied having any CSAM and appealed Defendant’s

decision to disable her account through Defendant’s internal appeal process. See id. at 6, 9–11.




                                                   2
Her appeal was forwarded to Google’s video-hosting service, YouTube, which reviewed her

appeal and confirmed that her account violated Defendant’s Community Guidelines. Def.’s Mot.

at 3; Compl. at 10–1. Defendant therefore denied her appeal and the termination of Plaintiff’s

Google account––including her associated Gmail and YouTube accounts––was upheld. See

Def.’s Mot. at 3. Plaintiff has since been permanently denied access to her Google account. See

Compl. at 11; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 2.

       Plaintiff then retained counsel through a service LegalShield, who wrote a letter on her

behalf to Defendant asking them to provide her with the details of her alleged violation as well as

provide her with access to the contents of her account to migrate the information elsewhere.

Compl. at 6–7; see Pl.’s Opp’n at 2. Plaintiff has indicated that she cannot afford full

representation, id., and she therefore proceeds pro se in this matter.

       Plaintiff filed a Complaint in District of Columbia Superior Court on June 16, 2023.

Compl. at 2. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is liable for breach of contract; fraud; violations of

the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments; and intentional infliction of emotional distress; id.;

she requests $2,500,000 in damages. Id. at 12. Defendant removed the Complaint to this Court

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332. See Notice of Removal ¶¶ 9, 14, ECF No. 1.

Defendant then filed a [8] Motion to Dismiss on July 20, 2023, in which it argues that Plaintiff’s

pleadings fail to satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and 12(b)(6) and, additionally, that

Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. See

generally Def.’s Mot. This Motion is now ripe for the Court’s review.

                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD

       A party may move under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss a complaint on the grounds that it

“fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “[A]




                                                  3
complaint [does not] suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual

enhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,

550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). Rather, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations that, if

accepted as true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.

“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to

draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 

556U.S. at 678.

        In ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court accepts as true the

well-pleaded allegations in the operative complaint, but “not ... the plaintiff’s legal conclusions

or inferences that are unsupported by the facts alleged.” Ralls, 758 F.3d at 315. The Court may

consider not only “the facts alleged in the complaint” but also “documents attached to the

complaint as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint and matters about which the

Court may take judicial notice.” Gustave-Schmidt v. Chao, 226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196 (D.D.C.

2002) (RBW) (citing EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624–25 (D.C.

Cir. 1997)).

        Pro se pleadings are held to “less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by

lawyers,” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam), but still they must satisfy the

minimal requirement of alleging sufficient “factual matter” to permit a court “to infer more than

the mere possibility of misconduct,” Brown v. Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc., 789 F.3d 146, 150
(D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Atherton v. District of Columbia Off. of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681–

82 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted)). When considering a motion to dismiss,

a court should read the pro se filings collectively. See Brown, 789 F.3d at 152 (“[A] district court

errs in failing to consider a pro se litigant’s complaint ‘in light of’ all filings, including filings




                                                    4
responsive to a motion to dismiss.”) (quoting Richardson v. United States, 193 F.3d 545, 548
(D.C. Cir. 1999)).

                                        III. DISCUSSION

       Defendant presents several arguments in support of its Motion to Dismiss. See generally

Def.’s Mot. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by Section 230 of the

Communications Decency Act; Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to satisfy Rule 8’s pleading

requirements; and Plaintiff failed to plead sufficient factual matter to render any of her claims

plausible. Id. at 1–2; see generally Def.’s Reply. The Court holds that Plaintiff’s Complaint fails

to meet the requirements set out by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and fails to state claims

upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) and, therefore, that Plaintiff’s Complaint

shall be dismissed without prejudice. In light of this conclusion, the Court need not address

whether Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act bars Plaintiff’s Complaint

   A. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8

       Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to satisfy basic pleading requirements in

support of her claims for breach of contract, fraud, constitutional violations, and intentional

infliction of emotional distress. Def.’s Mot. at 2, 8–9. The Court agrees.

       While pro se pleadings are held to “less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted

by lawyers,” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam), pro se litigants must

nevertheless comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Jarrell v. Tisch, 

656 F. Supp.237, 239 (D.D.C. 1987) (JGP); see also Fontaine v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 

42 F. Supp. 3d102, 107 (D.D.C. 2014) (KBJ) (“procedural rules must be followed [], and district courts have

discretion to dismiss a pro se plaintiff's complaint sua sponte for non-compliance”). Rule 8(a) of

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires complaints to contain “a short and plain statement


                                                  5
of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); see Iqbal, 556

U.S. at 678–79; Ciralsky v. CIA 355 F.3d 661, 668–71 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The purpose of the

minimum standard of Rule 8 is to give fair notice to the defendants of the claim being asserted,

sufficient to prepare a responsive answer, to prepare an adequate defense, and to determine

whether the doctrine of res judicata applies. Brown v. Califano, 75 F.R.D. 497, 498 (D.D.C.

1977) (JJS).

       Although Rule 8 does not expect “detailed factual allegations,” it does require enough

factual information “to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” Twombly, 

550 U.S. at544, and to “permit[] the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,” Jones v.

Horne, 634 F.3d 588, 596 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotations omitted). Courts in

this jurisdiction have routinely found that “[a] confused and rambling narrative of charges and

conclusions . . . does not comply with the requirements of Rule 8.” Cheeks v. Fort Myer Constr.

Corp., 71 F. Supp. 3d 163, 169 (D.D.C. 2014) (RCL) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also

Allen v. Mosseri, No. 1:22-cv-01366, 2022 WL 7182145, at *1 (D.D.C. 2022) (DLF) (dismissing

case because complaint “consists of a random collection of statements without clarity or

particularity”); Srulock-Zindler v. Zindler, No. 1:18-cv-01342, 2018 WL 11670246, at *1

(D.D.C. 2018) (RC) (dismissing case because complaint “fails to make out a discernable claim”);

Ferrell v. Fudge, No. 21-01412, 2023 WL 2043148, at *7 (D.D.C. 2023) (CKK) (dismissing case

because complaint “relies mostly on, at best, boilerplate allegations . . . with insinuations of a

conspiracy”). The Court notes that “[w]hile such a pro se litigant must of course be given fair

and equal treatment, [s]he cannot generally be permitted to shift the burden of litigating h[er]

case to the courts[.]” Dozier v. Ford Motor Co., 702 F.2d 1189, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 1983); see also

Roman v. National Reconnaissance Off., 952 F. Supp. 2d 159, 163 (D.D.C. 2013) (EGS) (“[A]




                                                  6
pro se complaint must still meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) to survive a Rule

12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.”).

       Plaintiff asserts some facts but relies primarily on conclusory allegations with

insinuations of a conspiracy orchestrated against her by Defendant. See, e.g., Compl. at 1–2;

Pl.’s Opp’n at 3–4. Plaintiff alleges that “Google, LLC falsely accused her of having content in

[her account] that supposedly involves a child being sexually abused or exploited,” id. at 1, but

does not expound upon this claim. She speculates that others, including Google, may be to

blame for the CSAM; for example, she claims that “Defendant Google, LLC may have

developed the illicit CSAM,” id. at 1–2, that “[i]f the CSAM material really exists, Plaintiff

states Defendant or a hacker developed it,” id. at 4, and later that “Plaintiff believes Defendant

(could have) induced or contributed to the development of this ugly material,” id. at 3. Plaintiff

asserts that “she is innocent of any wrongdoing” and that Google has “deprived Plaintiff other

[sic] gmail account for no proven reason.” Id. at 5. Plaintiff also includes information about

various hardships she has experienced, including the loss of family members, but fails to connect

them to her allegations against Defendant other than that “Plaintiff has to now deal with all of

this mess” in addition to her existing hardships. Id. at 6. Finally, Plaintiff contends that she “has

provided this Court with tangible facts of what Defendant Google LLC did to her – they took her

gmail account away from her without proper notice, and without any proof of what is alleged.”

Id. She demands $2.5 million in compensation. Compl. at 12.

       The Court finds that Plaintiff’s bare assertions fail to “give fair notice of the claim[s]

being asserted so as to permit [Defendant] the opportunity to . . . prepare an adequate defense.”

Brown, 75 F.R.D. 497 at 498. Although the Court sympathizes with Plaintiff’s situation, her

filings provide only a “confused and rambling narrative,” Cheeks, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 163, with




                                                  7
allegations of a conspiracy, Ferrell, 2023 WL 2043148, at *7, and a demand for millions of

dollars in damages for claims that the Court cannot say rise above a “speculative level” or “mere

possibility.” Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to fail to meet the requirements

of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.

   B. Rule 12(b)(6) Failure to State a Claim

       While Plaintiff’s failure to meet Rule 8’s pleading standard is sufficient for the Court to

dismiss her claims, the Court will also briefly address Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff fails to

state a plausible claim for relief. See Def.’s Mot. at 13–14; Def.’s Reply at 5–8. The Court shall

now address each of Plaintiff’s claims in turn.

           a. Breach of Contract

       Plaintiff argues that Defendant breached a contract allegedly created through Google’s

”Service Agreement” by disabling her Google account. See Compl. at 1; Pl.’s Opp’n at 4. But

Plaintiff does not allege any facts indicating that Defendant was contractually prohibited from

removing her Google account. See generally Compl.; Pl,’s Opp’n. Plaintiff only makes the

conclusory statement that “Defendant breached their contract with Plaintiff by not allowing her

to have access to her site.” See id. at 4. However, as Defendant points out, “[t]he applicable

terms of service are the Google Terms of Service… and the YouTube Terms of Service,” and

“[n]othing in these Terms of Service guarantees Plaintiff access to her Gmail account.” Def.’s

Reply at 5; see also id. Ex. 1 (Google’s Terms of Service); Ex. 2 (YouTube Terms of Service).

Furthermore, the Terms of Service specifically provide that Google can remove a user’s content

and suspend or terminate access to their Google services for a variety of reasons, including if the




                                                  8
user’s conduct is illegal or harmful. See Ex. 1 at 13; Ex. 2 at 12. Accordingly, the Court finds

that Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

           b. Fraud

       Plaintiff also claims that Defendant is liable for fraud. See Compl. at 1. In order to

establish a prima facie case of fraud under California law,2 Plaintiff must allege that there has

been: (a) misrepresentation; (b) knowledge of falsity; (c) intent to defraud; (d) justifiable

reliance; and (e) resulting damage. Lazar v. Superior Court, 909 P.2d 981, 984 (Cal. 1996). To

survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff need not make out a prima facie case of discrimination.

See Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F.3d 1111, 1114 (D.C. Cir. 2000). However, a plaintiff

must still allege “facts that, if true, would establish the elements of each claim,” Greer v. Bd. of

Trs. of Univ. of the D.C., 113 F. Supp. 3d 297, 310 (D.D.C. 2015) (TSC), and, therefore, “the

Court may explore the plaintiff’s prima facie case at the dismissal stage to determine whether the

plaintiff can ever meet [her] initial burden to establish a prima facie case,” Tressler v. Nat'l R.R.

Passenger Corp., 819 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2011) (RLW) (citation omitted).

       Plaintiff argues that “Defendant Google is guilty of fraud because they have deprived

Plaintiff other [sic] gmail account for no proven reason,” and that “[t]heir assertions are false,

thereby fraudulent. A literally true statement that creates a false impression can be actionable in

fraud.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 5. Beyond these conclusory statements, Plaintiff offers nothing to support

the elements of fraud––i.e., nothing to suggest that Google intended to defraud her, that she


2
  The relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant is governed by Google’s Terms of Service,
and these terms lay out that “California law [] govern[] all disputes arising out of or relating to
these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services.” See Def’s Reply Ex. 1 at
13. Accordingly, the Court shall apply California state law. See Milanovich v. Costa Crociere,
S.P.A., 954 F.2d 763, 767 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“Under American law, contractual choice-of-law
provisions are usually honored.”).

                                                  9
relied on any potential misrepresentations made by Defendant, or that any such reliance resulted

in damage. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for fraud upon

which relief can be granted.

           c. Constitutional Violations

       Plaintiff’s next claim is that Defendant violated her Constitutional rights under the First,

Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. See Compl. at 1. Specifically, she alleges that Google has

“in effect denied Plaintiff the ability to plead the ‘fifth’ if she were guilty of any wrong doing

here – which she is not,” and that Google has “denied her the right to life, liberty, and happiness”

under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pl.’s Opp’n at 5. She additionally claims that

Defendant violated her Due Process rights. Id.
       It is well-established that these constitutional rights “are protected only against

infringements by governments.” Lugar v. Edmonson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936 (1982) (quoting

Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 156 (1978)); see also Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507, 513
(1976) (“[T]he constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by

government, federal or state.”); Flagg Bros., 438 U.S. at 157 (“[O]nly a State or a private person

whose action may be fairly treated as that of the State itself may deprive him of an interest

encompassed within the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection[.]”) (citations and internal quotation

marks omitted); see Anderson v. USAir, Inc., 818 F.2d 49, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“[Appellant’s]

Fifth Amendment claim fails because [the] private corporation [] is not a state actor.”). Here,

Defendant Google is a private business, not a state actor,3 Freedom Watch, Inc. v. Google, Inc.,




3
 Plaintiff states that “the Corporation Service company is their registred [sic] agent for DC.”
Compl. at 3. To the extent that Plaintiff intended to allege that Google was a state actor, this
argument is insufficiently pled and fails.

                                                  10
368 F. Supp. 3d 30, 40 (D.D.C. 2019) (TNM) (finding Google is private business), aff’d, 818 F.

App’x 497 (D.C. Cir. 2020), and therefore cannot be held liable for the constitutional violations

that Plaintiff asserts. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth

Amendments likewise fail.

           d. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

       Finally, Plaintiff claims that Defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional

distress. See Compl. at 2; Pl.’s Opp’n at 5–6. Under California law, “[a] cause of action for

intentional infliction of emotional distress exists when there is (1) extreme and outrageous

conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing or reckless disregard of the probability of

causing emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and

(3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous

conduct.” Hughes v. Pair, 209 P.3d 963, 976 (Cal. 2009) (cleaned up).

       The Court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to meet the standard for

“severe or extreme emotional distress.” There is a “high bar” for severe and extreme emotional

distress, requiring the distress to have “such substantial quality or enduring quality that no

reasonable [person] . . . should be expected to endure it.” Id. Plaintiff has indicated that “[b]eing

accused of being involved in activity involving a child being hurt or abused is very disturbing

and upsetting;” she also alleges that she has suffered “stress,” “experience[d] pain,” and that this

has been “frustrating.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 6. Plaintiff’s experience of being very disturbed, upset,

and frustrated is similar to the suffering experienced by the plaintiff in Hughes v. Pair, which the

Supreme Court of California deemed to be insufficient to reach the level of severe emotional

distress. See Hughes, 209 P.3d at 976–77 (plaintiff complained of “discomfort, worry, anxiety,

upset stomach, concern, and agitation”); see also Def.’s Reply at 11 (“It was neither extreme nor


                                                  11
outrageous for Google to terminate Plaintiff’s account and privately inform her of its action and

reasons for doing so.”). Additionally, the hardships that Plaintiff discusses are mostly unrelated

to her incident with Defendant, although she indicates that she “has to now deal with all of this

mess concerning being falsely accused of having… (CSAM)” in addition to her existing

hardships. See Pl.’s Opp’n 6 (mentioning the death of relatives and her daughter’s health

conditions). Plaintiff has also not alleged any facts indicating that Defendant intended to cause

her any distress. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled facts required to state a

plausible claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

                                          *       *       *

       In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the pleading requirements under

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and, additionally, has failed to state claims upon which relief

can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). Accordingly, the Court need not address whether Section

230 of the Communications Decency Act bars Plaintiff’s Complaint.

                                              IV. CONCLUSION

       For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s [8] Motion to Dismiss and

dismisses this matter without prejudice. An appropriate order accompanies this Memorandum

Opinion.

                 GONZALEZ v. GOOGLE LLC
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
                  the ninth circuit
    No. 21–1333. Argued February 21, 2023—Decided May 18, 2023
In 2015, Nohemi Gonzalez, a U. S. citizen, was killed in a set of coordinated
  terrorist attacks carried out across Paris, France, under the direction of
  the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Gonzalez's parents and
  brothers sued Google LLC under 18 U. S. C. § 2333(a) and (d)(2), alleging
  that Google was both directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist
  attack that killed Gonzalez. With regard to their secondary-liability
  claims under § 2333(d)(2), plaintiffs alleged that Google aided and abet-
  ted and conspired with ISIS through ISIS' use of YouTube, which
  Google owns and operates. The District Court dismissed plaintiffs'
  complaint for failure to state a claim, though it offered plaintiffs leave
  to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs opted to appeal, and the Ninth
  Circuit affrmed in a consolidated opinion that the Court also addressed
  in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U. S. 471. With regard to this case,

Page Proof Pending Publication
  the Ninth Circuit held that most of plaintiffs' claims were barred by
  § 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The sole exceptions
  were claims based on allegations that YouTube maintained a revenue-
  sharing system through which Google approved ISIS videos and shared
  revenue with ISIS; however, the court held that those allegations failed
  to state a viable claim in any event. Plaintiffs sought review in this
  Court of the Ninth Circuit's application of § 230 but not of that court's
  holdings regarding the revenue-sharing claims.
Held: The Court declines to address the application of § 230 to a complaint
  that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief. The
  secondary-liability claims here are materially identical to those in the
  Twitter plaintiffs' complaint, and thus it appears to follow from the hold-
  ing of that case that the complaint here fails to state a claim for aiding
  and abetting under § 2333(d)(2). The remainder of plaintiffs' claims
  here may be barred by the Ninth Circuit's unchallenged holdings below.
  Accordingly, the Court remands the case for the Ninth Circuit to con-
  sider plaintiffs' complaint in light of this Court's decision in Twitter.

     “ISIS” is shorthand for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. In some
form or another, it has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization
since 2004; ISIS has also been known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant, al Qaeda in Iraq, and the al-Zarqawi Network.

U. S. C. §§ 2333(a) and (d)(2), alleging that Google was both
directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist attack that
killed Gonzalez.2 For their secondary-liability claims, plain-
tiffs alleged that Google aided and abetted and conspired
with ISIS. All of their claims broadly center on the use of
YouTube, which Google owns and operates, by ISIS and
ISIS supporters.
   The District Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for fail-
ure to state a claim, though it offered plaintiffs leave to
amend their complaint. Instead, plaintiffs stood on their
complaint and appealed, and the Ninth Circuit affrmed in a
consolidated opinion that we also addressed in Twitter, Inc.
v. Taamneh, 598 U. S. 471 (2023). 2 F. 4th 871 (2021). With
respect to this case, the Ninth Circuit held that most of the
plaintiffs' claims were barred by § 230 of the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 137, 47 U. S. C. § 230(c)(1).
The sole exceptions were plaintiffs' direct- and secondary-
Page Proof Pending Publication
liability claims based on allegations that Google approved
ISIS videos for advertisements and then shared proceeds
with ISIS through YouTube's revenue-sharing system. The
Ninth Circuit held that these potential claims were not
barred by § 230, but that plaintiffs' allegations failed to state
a viable claim in any event.

    Title 18 U. S. C. § 2333(a) provides: “Any national of the United States
injured in his or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of
international terrorism, or his or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may sue
therefor in any appropriate district court of the United States and shall
recover threefold the damages he or she sustains and the cost of the suit,
including attorney's fees.” Section 2333(d)(2) provides: “In an action
under subsection (a) for an injury arising from an act of international ter-
rorism committed, planned, or authorized by an organization that had been
designated as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U. S. C. 1189), as of the date on which
such act of international terrorism was committed, planned, or authorized,
liability may be asserted as to any person who aids and abets, by know-
ingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person
who committed such an act of international terrorism.”
622                GONZALEZ v. GOOGLE LLC

                            Per Curiam

   We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's appli-
cation of § 230. See 598 U. S. ––– (2022). Plaintiffs did not
seek review of the Ninth Circuit's holdings regarding their
revenue-sharing claims. In light of those unchallenged hold-
ings and our disposition of Twitter, on which we also granted
certiorari and in which we today reverse the Ninth Circuit's
judgment, it has become clear that plaintiffs' complaint—
independent of § 230—states little if any claim for relief.
As plaintiffs concede, the allegations underlying their
secondary-liability claims are materially identical to those at
issue in Twitter. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. Since we hold
that the complaint in that case fails to state a claim for aiding
and abetting under § 2333(d)(2), it appears to follow that the
complaint here likewise fails to state such a claim. And, in
discussing plaintiffs' revenue-sharing claims, the Ninth Cir-
cuit held that plaintiffs plausibly alleged neither that “Google
reached an agreement with ISIS,” as required for conspiracy
liability, nor that Google's acts were “intended to intimidate
Page Proof Pending Publication
or coerce a civilian population, or to infuence or affect a
government,” as required for a direct-liability claim under
§ 2333(a). 2 F. 4th, at 901, 907. Perhaps for that reason,
at oral argument, plaintiffs only suggested that they should
receive leave to amend their complaint if we were to reverse
and remand in Twitter. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58, 163.
   We need not resolve either the viability of plaintiffs' claims
as a whole or whether plaintiffs should receive further leave
to amend. Rather, we think it suffcient to acknowledge
that much (if not all) of plaintiffs' complaint seems to fail
under either our decision in Twitter or the Ninth Circuit's
unchallenged holdings below. We therefore decline to ad-
dress the application of § 230 to a complaint that appears to
state little, if any, plausible claim for relief. Instead, we va-
cate the judgment below and remand the case for the Ninth
Circuit to consider plaintiffs' complaint in light of our deci-
sion in Twitter.
                                                  It is so ordered.

2                                           IN RE: GOOGLE LLC




    Google LLC (“Google”) petitions for a writ of manda-
mus directing the United States District Court for the
Western District of Texas to vacate its order denying
Google’s motion to transfer and to transfer the case to the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. Jawbone Innovations, LLC (“Jawbone”) op-
poses. For the following reasons, we grant the petition and
direct transfer.
                              I
     Jawbone filed this patent infringement suit against
Google in the Western District of Texas (“Western Dis-
trict”) in September 2021, four months after being assigned
ownership of the nine asserted patents and seven months
after being incorporated in Texas. Appx60, Appx63,
Appx909. Jawbone also rents space in Waco, Texas to store
documents relating to the patents, and from which it con-
ducts some distribution and sales activities, Appx486-87,
but no Jawbone personnel work in that or any other loca-
tion in the Western District, Appx918.
     Google moved under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to transfer the
action to the Northern District of California (“Northern
District”). It argued that: the relevant technical aspects of
the accused earbuds, smartphones, speakers, displays, and
software products at the center of Jawbone’s infringement
allegations were researched, designed, and developed at
Google’s headquarters within the Northern District,
Appx15; the technology underlying the asserted patents as-
signed to Jawbone was likewise developed and prosecuted
in Northern California (by a company that developed and
sold “Jawbone” products and once bore a “Jawbone” name),
Appx15, Appx433, Appx958; witnesses and sources of proof
(including prototypes of the accused products, Google’s key
personnel with knowledge about the technical and finan-
cial issues, and four of the six named inventors) were pri-
marily located in the Northern District, Appx2, Appx5; and

IN RE: GOOGLE LLC                                           3



no witnesses or sources of proof were located in the West-
ern District, Appx2.
    The district court denied the motion. The court
acknowledged that the Northern District had a compara-
tive advantage in being able to compel unwilling witnesses
and in being more convenient for more willing witnesses.
Appx933. On the other hand, the court also determined
that the court congestion factor and judicial economy con-
siderations weighed against transfer. Appx934. The re-
maining factors, the court determined, favored neither
forum. Id. On balance, the court concluded that Google
had failed to demonstrate that the Northern District was
clearly more convenient and, accordingly, denied transfer.
Id.                              II
     Our limited task on mandamus is to determine
whether the district court clearly abused its discretion. See
In re Juniper Networks, Inc., 14 F.4th 1313, 1318 (Fed. Cir.
2021). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), a district court
may transfer any civil action to any other district court
where the action might have been brought for the conven-
ience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.
We follow regional circuit standards governing motions un-
der § 1404(a). See In re TS Tech USA Corp., 
551 F.3d 1315,1319 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit has made clear that while “the decision
of whether to transfer a case is committed to the district
court’s discretion,” In re Planned Parenthood Fed. of Am.,
Inc., 52 F.4th 625, 629 (5th Cir. 2022), when a movant
“demonstrates that the transferee venue is clearly more
convenient” the district court “should” grant transfer, In re
Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 315 (5th Cir. 2008)
(en banc); see also Planned Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 629(“The ultimate inquiry is whether the destination venue is
‘clearly more convenient than the venue chosen by the
plaintiff.’”) (quoting Volkswagen, 545 F.3d at 315).

4                                            IN RE: GOOGLE LLC




    The Fifth Circuit has identified “private and public in-
terest factors,” which are “not necessarily exhaustive or ex-
clusive,” to be evaluated in connection with determining
whether a case should be transferred.                  Planned
Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 630 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The private interest factors are: (1) the relative
ease of access to sources of proof; (2) the availability of com-
pulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses; (3)
the cost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all
other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, ex-
peditious, and inexpensive. Id. The public interest factors
are: (1) the administrative difficulties flowing from court
congestion; (2) the local interest in having localized inter-
ests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with
the law that will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance of
unnecessary problems of conflict of laws or in the applica-
tion of foreign law. Id.     The district court found that two of these factors weigh
against transfer (one only slightly), two weigh in favor of
transfer (one only slightly), and the remaining four factors
are neutral. Appx933-34. Notwithstanding our deferential
standard of review, and the fact that assessing the weight
given to any of the factors – as well as their overall balance
– is within the “sound discretion of the trial court based not
on per se rules but rather on an individualized, case-by-
case consideration of convenience and fairness,” In re
Vistaprint Ltd., 628 F.3d 1342, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted), we conclude that the dis-
trict court clearly abused its discretion. As we discuss
below, once the clear errors are corrected, (a) the two fac-
tors the district court found weigh against transfer are, at
best for Jawbone, neutral; (b) the factor the district court
found weighs only slightly in favor of transfer actually
weighs heavily in favor of transfer; (c) two factors the dis-
trict court found to be neutral actually favor transfer; and
(d) the remaining three factors either favor transfer or are
neutral, as the district court found.

                              A
     The district court held that the factor considering “all
other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, ex-
peditious, and inexpensive” weighs against transfer. This
was clearly erroneous. The only reason the court gave for
this determination was Jawbone’s co-pending case against
Apple in the Western District of Texas. Appx929-30. How-
ever, Apple, like Google, moved to transfer to the Northern
District of California. 1 Moreover, at the time Google’s mo-
tion was pending, another case involving the same patents,
Jawbone v. Amazon, had been ordered transferred from the
Eastern District of Texas to the Northern District of Cali-
fornia. Appx891-908. Consequently, whatever efficiencies
would be had by combining cases asserting the same pa-
tents against different defendants with different accused
products are as likely to be enjoyed by transferring this
case as not. Hence, even before the recent dismissal of the
Apple case, see supra n.1, this factor is, at best for Jawbone,
neutral. As importantly, judicial economy considerations
could not undermine the clear case for transfer in light of
the imbalance on the other factors. See In re Samsung El-
ecs. Co., 2 F.4th 1371, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (noting that
“incremental gains” in judicial economy were not sufficient



    1    The district court discounted Apple’s pending mo-
tion to transfer on the ground that it had ordered the par-
ties in that case to go through full fact discovery and then
re-brief the transfer motion. Appx929-30. However, in the
Apple case, the district court subsequently vacated its or-
der in light of our decision in In re Apple, 52 F.4th 1360(Fed. Cir. 2022); stayed proceedings pending its resolution
of Apple’s transfer motion, Jawbone Innovations, LLC v.
Apple Inc., No. 6:21-cv-00984-ADA (W.D. Tex. Nov. 8,
2022); and subsequently granted those parties’ joint motion
to dismiss with prejudice, Jawbone, No. 6:21-cv-00984-
ADA (W.D. Tex. Dec. 23, 2022).

“to justify overriding the inconvenience to the parties and
witnesses”); Planned Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 632 n.5 (de-
clining to give significant weight to possibility of co-pend-
ing cases when those cases “involve[d] different parties[]
[and] different claims,” “although some factual issues may
be similar”).
    The district court held that the “administrative diffi-
culties flowing from court congestion” factor weighed
slightly against transfer. While we defer to the district
court’s assessment of the average time to trial data, see
Planned Parenthood, 52 F.4th at 631; In re Genentech, Inc.,
566 F.3d 1338, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“We do not disturb
the district court’s suggestion that it could dispose of the
case more quickly than if the case was transferred to the
Northern District of California.”), in this case it was a clear
abuse of discretion to accord this factor any weight, see Ju-
niper, 14 F.4th at 1322 (discounting time-to-trial difference
because there was no “need of a quick resolution” where
patentee lacked “position in the market . . . being threat-
ened”). It appears undisputed that Jawbone (unlike its
predecessor owners of the patents) is not engaged in prod-
uct competition in the marketplace and is not threatened
in the market in a way that, in other patent cases, might
add urgency to case resolution and give some significance
to the time-to-trial difference. Nor does the record reveal
any other basis on which to accord significance to whatever
greater speed the district court speculates it could reach
trial as compared to Northern California. See Genentech,
566 F.3d at 1347 (describing this factor as “most specula-
tive”). This factor, then, is neutral.
                              B
    The district court held that the “cost of attendance for
willing witnesses” factor weighed only slightly in favor of
transfer. This was clearly erroneous as this factor weighs
heavily in favor of transfer.

IN RE: GOOGLE LLC                                          7



    It is evident that the Northern District of California
would be more convenient for potential witnesses. In addi-
tion to several third-party witnesses located in the North-
ern District, Google submitted a sworn declaration from its
Discovery and Litigation Support team Project Manager,
Michelle True, which identified Google employees in the
Northern District who were part of the product and engi-
neering teams with technical knowledge of the accused
functionality, employees who authored articles that were
discussed in the complaint, and employees knowledgeable
about Google’s marketing of the accused products and fi-
nances. Appx21-28.
     The court weighed this factor only slightly in favor of
transfer after finding Ms. True’s declaration was unrelia-
ble, Appx920, but the steep discounting of this factor is un-
reasonable on the record. Ms. True’s investigation revealed
at least eleven Google employees in the Northern District
that the district court credited as potential witnesses,
Appx916, and found no Google employee in the Western
District of Texas who worked on what Google understood
to be the accused features, Appx21-23, Appx25, Appx27.
The district court faulted Ms. True for not addressing three
of Google’s Texas employees that Jawbone identified as
having potentially relevant knowledge based on Jawbone’s
review of their online profiles, but Google provided sworn,
unequivocal deposition testimony from each employee ex-
plaining that none of them work on the accused features.
Even if these three individuals had relevant and material
information, the court found that eleven other potential
witnesses reside in the Northern District. 2 On this record,



    2   The district court also discounted the declaration
on the ground that Ms. True was not an engineer who had
personally worked on the design, development, or testing
of the accused products. Appx914 n.2. But neither the
court nor Jawbone cited any authority that would impose

8                                           IN RE: GOOGLE LLC




the district court should have weighed this factor firmly
(not slightly) in favor of transfer.
                              C
    The district court held that the “local interest” factor
was neutral, but its conclusion was an abuse of discretion
as it gave significant weight to Jawbone’s office and corpo-
rate residence in Waco. Appx933. The court recognized
that Jawbone “established itself in Waco less than one year
before it filed this lawsuit,” id., and “none of its personnel
are here in this District,” Appx918. Jawbone incorporated
in Texas in February 2021 and established an office in
Waco in August 2021, just one month before it filed suit
against Google. Appx486. Jawbone conducts no activities
from Texas that relate to the accused technology.
Appx877-78. Under such circumstances, Jawbone has no
meaningful presence in the Western District of Texas that
should be given significant, let alone, comparable weight to
the facts tying the litigation to the California forum, where
both the patented and accused technology were developed.
See Juniper, 14 F.4th at 1320-21 (“[L]ittle or no weight
should be accorded to a party’s ‘recent and ephemeral’



such a requirement, and there is no reason to doubt the
adequacy of Ms. True’s investigation regarding the eleven
potential witnesses in the Northern District. That is so
even if the district court could legitimately fault Ms. True’s
statement that she was “not aware of any current Google
employees working on the Accused Features and the Ac-
cused Products,” in light of Google’s seeming concession
that some of its Texas employees work on aspects of the
accused products (though not, says Google, the accused fea-
tures). Appx27, Appx914 n.2. The statement reveals, at
most, a partial gap in Ms. True’s knowledge, but no basis
for substantially discounting the imbalanced nature of
where the potential Google witnesses are located.

presence in the transferor forum, such as by establishing
an office in order to claim a presence in the district for pur-
poses of litigation.”); In re Verizon Bus. Network Servs. Inc.,
635 F.3d 559, 562 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (giving no weight to lo-
cation of office in transferor forum where plaintiff had no
personnel but merely retained documents from prior litiga-
tion there).
     By contrast, the events giving rise to this patent in-
fringement suit clearly have a particularized connection
with Northern California. The patented technology was in-
vented in, and the patents prosecuted from, that forum.
Additionally, the district court found that Google developed
the accused products in the Northern District, notwith-
standing Google’s separate office in Austin. Appx932; see
also Def. Distributed v. Bruck, 30 F.4th 414, 435 (5th Cir.
2022) (“[T]he local interest in having localized interests de-
cided at home, ‘most notably regards not merely the par-
ties’ significant connections to each forum writ large, but
rather the significant connections between a particular
venue and the events that gave rise to a suit.’”) (quoting In
re Apple Inc., 979 F.3d 1332, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2020)). It was
clear error not to find that the local interest factor favors
transfer.
     The district court found the “relative ease of access to
sources of proof” factor was neutral. This was clearly erro-
neous as this factor favors transfer. Physical prototypes of
the accused products have been identified only as in the
Northern District of California, Appx21, Appx23, Appx25,
and four of the six inventors reside in the Northern Dis-
trict, as do the prosecuting attorneys, relevant former
Google employees, and third-party companies that provide
certain accused functionality for the accused products,
Appx22, Appx24. The Northern District would clearly pro-
vide easier access to sources of proof, including documents,
and be more convenient for potential non-party witnesses.

                               D
      We will address the remaining factors briefly. The dis-
 trict court correctly recognized that the “availability of
 compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses”
 favors transfer, as the Northern District could compel mul-
 tiple potential witnesses to appear at trial while no likely
 non-party witnesses have been identified whom the West-
 ern District has authority to compel. We agree with the
 district court, and both parties, that the “familiarity of the
 forum with the law that will govern the case” and the “prob-
 lems associated with conflicts of law” are neutral.
                              III
      In sum, on the record before us, four factors favor
 transfer and four factors are neutral. No factor weighs
 against transfer. The center of gravity of this action, focus-
 ing on the Volkswagen factors and the overriding conven-
 ience inquiry, is clearly in the Northern District of
 California, not in the Western District of Texas. The dis-
 trict court clearly erred in finding otherwise and its deci-
 sion to deny Google’s motion to transfer was a clear abuse
 of discretion.
      Accordingly,
      IT IS ORDERED THAT:
     The petition is granted. The district court’s order deny-
 ing Google’s motion to transfer is vacated, and the district
 court is directed to grant the transfer motion.

""5. The district court improperly discounted sworn declarations identifying key witnesses in California and failed to account for the significant imbalance in witness location."",

                                    MEMORANDUM OPINION
        Plaintiff, who appears to be incarcerated in Poland, initiated this matter on January 31,

2020. She filed a pro se complaint and first application for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

(“IFP”). The court found that plaintiff’s first IFP application was patently insufficient and failed

to provide any information whatsoever regarding her financial circumstances. See 28 U.S.C. §

1915(a)(1). In furtherance, on March 5, 2020, the court issued an order allowing plaintiff thirty

days to submit an acceptable amended IFP application or to pay the $400 filing fee applicable to

civil actions.

        On June 8, 2020, plaintiff filed a motion for extension of time, and in the following month,

she submitted three additional notices. Both the motion and the notices are mostly intelligible. On

July 6, 2020, plaintiff complied, albeit late, and filed an amended IFP application in response to

the court’s order. The court will grant the amended IFP application and now turn to plaintiff’s

complaint.

        The prolix complaint is written in both English and, ostensibly, Polish. Where the

complaint is in English is it nonetheless entirely incomprehensible. Plaintiff sues Google and other

unspecified defendants for violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The rambling complaint seems to (1)
take general issue with her incarceration in Poland, including her psychological and medical

treatment; (2) allege theft of intellectual property; (3) raise issues regarding unknown financial

information that she provided to “Polish courts” and other unknown “Polish institutions[;]” and

(4) allege that defendant attempted to murder her. Any other details are undecipherable. The relief

sought is unknown.

       Further, the complaint does not include facts that would give rise to a plausible inference

that the plaintiff has suffered the deprivation of a protected right, see Melton v. District of

Columbia, 85 F. Supp. 3d 183, 193 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Events may not have unfolded as Plaintiff

wished, but [her] dissatisfaction . . . [does] not form a basis for a due process violation”), or how

Google may be sued pursuant to Section 1983, where there is no indication that it is a state actor

acting under color of state law, see City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 829 (1985).

       Pro se litigants must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Jarrell v. Tisch,

656 F. Supp. 237, 239 (D.D.C. 1987). Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires

complaints to contain “(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction

[and] (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”

Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a); see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79 (2009); Ciralsky v. CIA, 

355 F.3d661, 668–71 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The Rule 8 standard ensures that defendants receive fair notice of

the claim being asserted so that they can prepare a responsive answer and an adequate defense and

determine whether the doctrine of res judicata applies. Brown v. Califano, 75 F.R.D. 497, 498
(D.D.C. 1977). “A confused and rambling narrative of charges and conclusions . . . does not

comply with the requirements of Rule 8.” Cheeks v. Fort Myer Constr. Corp., 

71 F. Supp. 3d 163,169 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
       The ambiguous allegations composing the complaint fail to provide adequate notice of any

claim. The intended causes of action and specific alleged wrongdoing committed by defendant

are undefined. The pleading also fails to set forth allegations with respect to this court’s

jurisdiction, or a valid basis for an award of damages. In fact, it is unclear what actual damages,

if any, plaintiff claims. Therefore, this case will be dismissed. A separate order accompanies this

memorandum opinion.

     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge REYNA.
  Opinion dissenting-in-part filed by Circuit Judge PROST.
 REYNA, Circuit Judge.
     EcoFactor sued Google in the Western District of Texas
 alleging patent infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,738,327.
 After discovery and resolution of various motions, the case
 was heard by a jury. The jury found that Google infringed
 the asserted claim 5 of the ’327 patent and awarded dam-
 ages to EcoFactor. Google appeals three of the district
 court’s orders: the denial of Google’s motion for summary
 judgment that claim 5 of the ’327 patent was invalid under
 35 U.S.C. § 101; the denial of Google’s motion for judgment
 as a matter of law of non-infringement of the ’327 patent;
 and the denial of Google’s motion for a new trial on dam-
 ages. For the following reasons, we affirm.
                         BACKGROUND
                 A. U.S. Patent No. 8,738,327
U.S. Patent No. 8,738,327 (“’327 patent”) relates gen-
 erally to the operation of smart thermostats in computer-
 networked heating and cooling systems (“HVAC systems”).
 The primary recited purpose of the patent is to reduce
 strain on the electricity grid during a period of expected
 high demand through adjustments to the user’s thermostat
 settings that reduce the electricity consumed by the user’s
 HVAC system. ’327 patent at 1:21–27, 9:46–54. Claim 1 of
 the ’327 patent recites a system “for controlling the opera-
 tional status of an HVAC system” where “at least one ther-
 mostat [is] associated with a structure that receives
 temperature measurements from inside the structure.” Id. at 9:26–31. Claim 1 includes an “estimation” limitation
 where “one or more servers receive inside temperatures
 from the thermostat and compare[] the inside tempera-
 tures of the structure and the outside temperatures over
 time to derive an estimation for the rate of change in inside
 temperature of the structure in response to outside

 temperature.” Id. at 9:38–45 (emphasis added). Claim 5
 adds that “the estimation [limitation in claim 1] is a pre-
 diction about the future rate of change in temperature in-
 side the structure.” Id. at 9:65–67.
                     B. Procedural History
      EcoFactor, owner of the ’327 patent, sued Google for
 patent infringement over Google’s smart thermostat prod-
 ucts, particularly several Nest thermostats. 1 After discov-
 ery, Google moved for summary judgment that certain
 claims of the ’327 patent (including claim 5) were invalid
 because they were directed to patent ineligible subject mat-
 ter, an abstract idea, under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The district
 court denied the motion. J.A. 5046.
     The district court also denied Google’s Daubert motion
 to exclude the opinion of EcoFactor’s damages expert, Mr.
 Kennedy, rejecting Google’s argument that Mr. Kennedy’s
 opinion was unreliable and therefore prejudicial.
 J.A. 2254.
     Following a six-day jury trial, the jury found that
 Google infringed claim 5 of the ’327 patent and awarded
 EcoFactor damages. J.A. 45–49. Google renewed its mo-
 tion for judgment as a matter of law (“JMOL”) of non-in-
 fringement of the ’327 patent, arguing that the accused
 products do not measure, but rather, estimate the temper-
 ature inside the structure and therefore cannot infringe.
 Google also moved for a new trial on damages, arguing that
 the opinion of EcoFactor’s damages expert, Mr. Kennedy,
 was speculative and unreliable such that it should have
 been excluded from trial. The district court denied both
 motions from the bench. J.A. 6662; J.A. 6688.

    Google appeals.          We     have   jurisdiction   under
 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).
                           DISCUSSION
     Google raises three issues on appeal. 2 First, Google
 contends the district court erred in denying Google’s mo-
 tion for summary judgment that claim 5 of the ’327 patent
 was directed to patent ineligible subject matter under
 § 101. Second, Google asserts the district court erred in
 denying Google’s JMOL motion for non-infringement of the
 ’327 patent. Third, Google contends the district court erred
 in denying Google’s motion for a new trial on damages be-
 cause Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion was based on unre-
 liable methodology. We address each issue in turn.
                      I. Patent Eligibility
     Google appeals the district court’s denial of summary
 judgment that claim 5 of the ’327 patent was patent ineli-
 gible under § 101.
     Section 101 of the Patent Act provides that: “Whoever
 invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and
 useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor,
 subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”
 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Supreme Court has articulated a two-
 step test, commonly referred to as the “Alice” test, for ex-
 amining whether a patent claims patent-ineligible subject
 matter. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Intern., 573 U.S.



2    This appeal was originally consolidated and in-
 cluded an original appeal by EcoFactor and cross-appeal by
 Google. The consolidated appeal contained other patents
 and issues. Prior to oral argument, the parties stipulated
 to the dismissal of the original appeal by EcoFactor, Appeal
 No. 22–1974, leaving only Google’s cross-appeal involving
 the ’327 patent. See Appeal No. 22–1974, ECF No. 59 at 7.

 208, 217–18 (2014). At Alice step one, we review whether
 a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept, such as an
 abstract idea. Id. At Alice step two, we review whether the
 claim recites elements sufficient to transform the abstract
 idea into a patent-eligible application. Id. at 217–18, 221.
     Prior to trial, Google filed a motion for summary judg-
 ment, arguing that claim 5 of the ’327 patent (among oth-
 ers) was invalid as directed to patent ineligible subject
 matter under § 101. The district court reviewed the mo-
 tion, relying on the Alice inquiry. The district court denied
 the motion and submitted step two of the Alice inquiry to
 the jury. J.A. 5046.
     At trial, the verdict form asked whether Google met its
 burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
 elements of claim 5 of the ’327 patent, when taken individ-
 ually and as an ordered combination, involved activities or
 technology that were well-understood, routine, or conven-
 tional to a skilled artisan at the time of the invention.
 J.A. 47. After hearing testimony and receiving evidence
 from both parties, the jury answered “no” for claim 5 of the
 ’327 patent. J.A. 47. Google filed a post-trial JMOL motion
 repeating its § 101 arguments, which the district court de-
 nied.
     Google now appeals the district court’s denial of sum-
 mary judgment regarding patent ineligibility of claim 5 of
 the ’327 patent, but we have held that a district court’s de-
 nial of summary judgment is not appealable after a trial on
 the merits. Syngenta Crop Prot., LLC v. Willowood, LLC,
 944 F.3d 1344, 1364 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citing Ortiz v. Jor-
 dan, 562 U.S. 180, 183–84 (2011)); see also 10 Wright and
 Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2715 (4th ed.) (ex-
 plaining a denial from summary judgment is an order
 “from which no immediate appeal is available”). We have
 explained that an order denying summary judgment is “not
 a judgment” and “does not foreclose trial on the issues on
 which summary judgment was sought;” rather, it is

 6                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 “merely a judge’s determination that genuine issues of ma-
 terial fact exist.” Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co., 
797 F.2d1564, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (reasoning that a denial of sum-
 mary judgment “does not settle or even tentatively decide
 anything about the merits of the claim” (citation omitted)).
 Denial of summary judgment decides only one thing—that
 the case should go to trial. Id.     At trial, the jury heard testimony from various wit-
 nesses on whether the elements of claim 5 were well-un-
 derstood, routine, or conventional. See, e.g., J.A. 5345–
 5346 (209:20–210:6); J.A. 6373–6374 (1237:15–1238:19);
 J.A. 6415–6416 (1279:1–1280:20); J.A. 6449–6451
 (1313:17–1315:11). Google, however, appeals the order
 denying summary judgment but not the jury verdict of in-
 eligibility. As the Supreme Court has explained, “the full
 record developed in court supersedes the record existing at
 the time of the summary-judgment motion.” Ortiz, 
562U.S. at 184. Because trial on the merits of the § 101 issue
 was held, the court’s denial of summary judgment is not
 appealable.
                      II. Infringement
     For infringement, the only limitation at issue is
 claim 1’s recitation of a system for controlling the HVAC
 system that includes a thermostat “that receives tempera-
 ture measurements from inside the structure.” ’327 patent
 at 9:26–31. Google alleges that because the accused ther-
 mostat products are designed to be completely enclosed in
 metal, plastic, and/or glass housings, they cannot directly
 measure the surrounding ambient temperature “inside the
 structure” like other thermostats. 3 Appellant Br. 41–44.



     3   The parties agree that the term “ambient tempera-
 ture” refers to the temperature surrounding a particular
 thermostat, i.e., the temperature of the room or structure
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18      Page: 7    Filed: 06/03/2024




 ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC                              7



 Google argues that its thermostats can only derive an esti-
 mate of the ambient temperature by measuring only the
 temperature within the thermostat housing itself, which is
 not “inside the structure.” See id. As a result, Google ar-
 gues that the jury’s verdict of infringement is unsupported
 by substantial evidence.
     We review the disposition of motions for JMOL under
 the law of the regional circuit, here the Fifth Circuit. See
 Energy Transp. Grp. Inc. v. William Demant Holding A/S,
 697 F.3d 1342, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The Fifth Circuit re-
 views de novo the grant or denial of a JMOL motion. Clear-
 Value, Inc. v. Pearl River Polymers, Inc., 
668 F.3d 1340,1343 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Under Fifth Circuit law, a jury’s ver-
 dict is upheld if supported by substantial evidence. Med.
 Care Am., Inc. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 
341 F.3d 415,420 (5th Cir. 2003).
      We conclude that the jury’s infringement verdict is sup-
 ported by substantial evidence. EcoFactor’s infringement
 expert testified that the accused thermostat products meet
 the claimed limitation because the thermostats measured
 temperature of the structure and not just the temperature
 within the thermostat housing.              J.A. 5462–63
 (326:20–327:6). EcoFactor’s expert supported his conclu-
 sion with several forms of evidence. EcoFactor’s expert re-
 lied on website guides maintained by Google for the benefit
 of software engineers who develop applications for use with
 Nest thermostats. One website page states that the Nest
 thermostats measure the “[a]mbient temperature,” defined
 as the “temperature measured near the thermostat”—not
 just within the thermostat. J.A. 10429 (emphasis added).
 Another website page explains that the temperature sen-
 sors of certain Nest products measure ambient room tem-
 perature. J.A. 10888. EcoFactor’s expert testified that this


 in which the thermostat is placed. Appellant Br. 13, 43;
 Appellee Br. 1, 9–10.

 8                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 evidence shows that the Nest thermostat “devices have
 temperature measurements near the thermostat” that
 measures the “inside temperature” of the structure and are
 not limited to measuring temperature inside the thermo-
 stat housing. J.A. 5453–55 (317:17–319:14). EcoFactor’s
 expert cited Google’s source code for the accused products
 and demonstrated where it described the function of the
 accused products to measure the surrounding temperature.
 J.A. 5456–60 (320:18–324:14).
     Google’s experts conceded the substance of EcoFactor’s
 evidence on cross-examination. Google’s non-infringement
 expert agreed that, according to Google’s website pages, the
 current ambient temperature in the room is measured by
 the Nest thermostat’s internal sensors. J.A. 6154–55
 (1018:9–1020:13). Another Google expert witness agreed
 that the accused thermostat products contain temperature
 sensors that measure the temperature inside customer
 homes. J.A. 5945–46 (809:4–809:17).
     The expert testimony from both parties, documentary
 evidence, and source code information demonstrating that
 the accused products measure temperature of the sur-
 rounding structure (and not just the housing) is substantial
 evidence. See In re Mouttet, 686 F.3d 1322, 1331 (Fed. Cir.
 2012) (explaining substantial evidence is “relevant evi-
 dence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
 support a conclusion”).
    In conclusion, the jury’s infringement verdict that the
 accused Nest thermostat products satisfy the claim lan-
 guage of “receives temperature measurements from inside
 the structure” is supported by substantial evidence.
                       III. Damages
     Google argues that the district court abused its discre-
 tion in denying its Rule 59 motion for a new trial on dam-
 ages. Appellant Br. 30. According to Google, a new trial
 on damages was warranted because the initial trial was
Case: 23-1101     Document: 18      Page: 9    Filed: 06/03/2024




 ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC                                9



 unfair or marred by prejudicial error. Id. at 25; J.A. 6689
 (91:4–8). The alleged error was the district court’s eviden-
 tiary ruling that the opinion of EcoFactor’s damages ex-
 pert, Mr. Kennedy, was admissible. Appellant Br. 25, 30.
 Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion should
 have been excluded from trial because it lacked any relia-
 ble methodology or underlying calculations. Id. at 30.
 Google also argues that Mr. Kennedy’s opinion should have
 been excluded for lack of comparability and apportionment.
 Id. at 34. We address each argument in turn.
     We review the denial of a motion for a new trial under
 regional circuit law. Wordtech Sys., Inc. v. Integrated Net-
 works Sols., Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The
 Fifth Circuit reviews a district court’s denial of a motion for
 a new trial for an abuse of discretion. Fornesa v. Fifth
 Third Mortg. Co., 897 F.3d 624, 627 (5th Cir. 2018). A new
 trial may be granted if the district court finds that “the ver-
 dict is against the weight of the evidence, the damages
 awarded are excessive, the trial was unfair, or prejudicial
 error was committed.” Seidman v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 
923F.2d 1134, 1140 (5th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted); Fed. R.
 Civ. P. 59. “Courts do not grant new trials unless it is rea-
 sonably clear that prejudicial error has crept into the rec-
 ord or that substantial justice has not been done, and the
 burden of showing harmful error rests on the party seeking
 the new trial.” Jordan v. Maxfield & Oberton Holdings,
 L.L.C., 977 F.3d 412, 417 (5th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).
      Here, Mr. Kennedy used the hypothetical negotiation
 approach for calculating reasonable royalty damages under
 35 U.S.C. § 284. This approach “necessarily involves an el-
 ement of approximation and uncertainty.” Lucent Techs.,
 Inc. v. Gateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2009)
 (citation omitted); see also generally 2 Janice M. Mueller,
 Mueller on Patent Enforcement § 20.04(a) at 869–70 (rev.
 ed. 2019). According to Mr. Kennedy, EcoFactor would
 have entered the hypothetical negotiation with the

 expectation of receiving a royalty in the amount of $X 4 per
 unit and would have requested that from Google.
 J.A. 1277. Based on this $X rate, Mr. Kennedy calculated
 his proposed damages amount of $Y 5.            J.A. 5740
 (604:14–17).
                                A.
     Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s damages model was
 speculative and conclusory. Appellant Br. 31. Specifically,
 Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s proposed $X royalty rate
 was “plucked . . . out of nowhere.” Id. at 34 (citation omit-
 ted). We disagree.
     “[W]hile all [damages] approximations involve some
 degree of uncertainty, the admissibility inquiry centers on
 whether the methodology employed is reliable.” Summit 6,
 LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 802 F.3d 1283, 1296 (Fed. Cir.
 2015). This includes whether a damages expert’s testi-
 mony is tied to the particular facts of the case. Virnetx, Inc.
 v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 767 F.3d 1308, 1333–34 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
 Whitserve, LLC v. Comput. Packages, Inc., 694 F.3d 10, 30 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Lucent Techs., 580 F.3d at 1330. Testi-
 mony is inadmissible when it is based only on speculation
 or guesswork, such that the jury is left to fill in the gaps
 when calculating a damages award. Whitserve, 694 F.3d at
 30–33 (holding that testimony was conclusory and specula-
 tive when expert did not explain how lump sum amounts
 could be converted to a reasonable royalty rate); Wordtech,
 609 F.3d at 1320 (holding that expert’s reliance on two




      4  The amount of the per-unit royalty rate is confiden-
 tial business information subject to a protective order, and
 as such, is not recited in this opinion.
      5  The amount of EcoFactor’s proposed damages
 award is confidential business information subject to a pro-
 tective order, and as such, is not recited in this opinion.
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18      Page: 11     Filed: 06/03/2024

 lump licenses was inappropriate when neither explained
 how the lump-sum amounts were calculated).
     Far from plucking the $X royalty rate from nowhere,
 Mr. Kennedy based this rate on the following admissible
 evidence: three license agreements and the testimony of
 EcoFactor’s CEO, Mr. Habib. Turning first to the agree-
 ments, Mr. Kennedy relied on three license agreements
 EcoFactor entered into with third-party smart thermostat
 manufacturers—the Schneider and Daikin licenses in
 2020, and the Johnson license in 2021. J.A. 10389–399;
 J.A. 10400–410; J.A. 10411–419. Each of these agreements
 included the same $X royalty rate at issue here. Each li-
 cense agreement provided in a whereas clause that the li-
 censee would pay EcoFactor a lump sum amount “set forth
 in this Agreement based on what EcoFactor believes is a
 reasonable royalty calculation of [$X] per-unit for . . . esti-
 mated past and [] projected future sales of products ac-
 cused of infringement in the Litigation.” J.A. 10389
 (emphasis added); J.A 10400; J.A. 10411. Thus, as Mr.
 Kennedy testified at trial, the $X royalty rate was “specifi-
 cally spelled out in the license agreement[s].” J.A. 5764
 (628:2–3).
      Mr. Kennedy then relied on the testimony of EcoFac-
 tor’s CEO, Mr. Habib, who signed the three license agree-
 ments on behalf of EcoFactor. J.A. 5794 (658:17–18);
 J.A. 5666 (530:23–25); J.A. 5669 (533:6–8). Mr. Habib tes-
 tified that he had seven years in the industry, an under-
 standing of the market, and “what is reasonable for the
 technologies that [EcoFactor] ha[s].”           J.A. 5670
 (534:22–25). He then testified that the lump sums con-
 tained in each of the three license agreements were based
 on the $X royalty rate. J.A. 5672, 536:17–18 (“[M]y under-
 standing was that all of it is based on [$X] per infringing
 unit.”). He testified that while he was shielded from the
 licensees’ confidential sales information, he understood
 that EcoFactor calculated each of the three licenses’ lump
 sums using the $X royalty rate and the past and future
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18     Page: 12    Filed: 06/03/2024




 12                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 projected sales for each licensee. J.A. 5798 (662:2–5); J.A.
 5670 (534:4–10). He also testified that despite being
 shielded from the licensees’ confidential sales numbers, he
 believed, based on his understanding of the market, that
 the lump sums reasonably reflected the licensees’ sales.
 J.A. 5672 (536:14–24). According to Mr. Habib, there were
 “large players” and high barriers to entry in the smart ther-
 mostat and smart HVAC control industry, and the licen-
 sees were “relatively new or more recent.” J.A. 5672
 (536:19–24). Thus, “it ma[de] sense that their sale num-
 bers would be low since they’d recently started.” J.A. 5672
 (536:23–24). He testified that the $X royalty rate in each
 of the three license agreements was accepted by the par-
 ties. J.A. 5671 (535:5–11) (“So, you know, if three compa-
 nies were willing to accept it, then yeah. That further
 made it clear to me that it was a reasonable royalty rate
 that was being accepted by counterparties.”).
     Finally, in support of Mr. Kennedy’s proposed $X roy-
 alty rate, EcoFactor introduced at trial an email chain be-
 tween EcoFactor and Johnson concerning the $X royalty
 rate. J.A. 10797–99; J.A. 6278 (1142:3–10). In the chain,
 which was dated a few months before the parties signed the
 license agreement, the parties discuss the $X royalty rate.
 J.A. 10797–99. Johnson notes that “[w]e are applying the
 [$X rate] to the time period” identified by EcoFactor.
 J.A. 10798.
     In light of the three license agreements, Mr. Habib’s
 testimony, and the EcoFactor-Johnson email chain, we de-
 termine that Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion concerning
 the $X royalty rate was sufficiently tied to the facts of the
 case and thus admissible. See Finjan, Inc. v. Secure Com-
 puting Corp., 626 F.3d 1197, 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2010); C & F
 Packing Co., v. IBP, Inc., 224 F.3d 1296, 1304–05 (Fed. Cir.
 2000). And based on this context, the “jury was entitled to
 hear the expert testimony” from Mr. Kennedy concerning
 the $X royalty rate and “decide for itself what to accept or
 reject.” Pavo Sols. LLC v. Kingston Tech. Co., 35 F.4th
Case: 23-1101    Document: 18     Page: 13    Filed: 06/03/2024




 ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC                             13



 1367, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (citation omitted). That is ex-
 actly what the jury did in this case. The jury heard Mr.
 Kennedy’s testimony and Google’s extensive cross-exami-
 nation concerning Mr. Kennedy’s understanding of the
 three license agreements, his reliance on Mr. Habib’s testi-
 mony, and testimony concerning the emails between Eco-
 Factor and Johnson about the $X royalty rate. J.A.
 5793–5812 (657:4–676:2); J.A. 5794 (658:17–18); J.A. 5667
 (531:8–25); J.A. 5668–5670 (532:3–534:3); J.A. 6278–6280
 (1142:6–1144:19). Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict
 of $20,019,300, which represents significantly less than
 Mr. Kennedy’s proposed damages amount of $Y that would
 have resulted from applying the $X royalty rate to Google’s
 past sales.
      Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s testimony is unreli-
 able because there is no evidence that the parties to the
 three license agreements actually applied the $X royalty
 rate. To the contrary. First, the three admissible license
 agreements each disclose that EcoFactor believed that the
 lump sums in each license was “based on” the $X royalty
 rate. Additionally, in its whereas clause, the Schneider li-
 cense agreement, unlike the Johnson and Daikin agree-
 ments, states that “nothing in this clause should be
 interpreted as agreement by Schneider that [$X] per unit
 is a reasonable royalty.” J.A. 10400. This clause, included
 by Schneider, speaks to its belief that $X may not have been
 reasonable but it does not speak to whether $X was actu-
 ally applied in arriving at the lump sum. Arguably, this
 provision, when read in context, could also mean that the
 $X royalty rate was applied by EcoFactor and Schneider.
 If Schneider did not believe that the $X royalty rate was
 actually being applied, it could have said such in the agree-
 ment. But Schneider did not. Finally, as noted above,
 Johnson noted in an email chain with EcoFactor that it was
 “applying” the $X royalty rate. How much weight should
 be given to the provisions in the license agreements, includ-
 ing whether they are “self-serving” as Google claims, and

 the EcoFactor-Johnson email is a question for the jury. See
 Pavo, 35 F.4th at 1379; Finjan, 626 F.3d at 1212; C & F
 Packing, 224 F.3d at 1304. 6
     To conclude, we determine that Mr. Kennedy’s opinion
 concerning the $X royalty rate was sufficiently reliable for
 admissibility purposes. For this reason, we hold that the
 district court did not abuse its discretion in denying
 Google’s motion for a new trial on damages.
                                B.
     Google argues that Mr. Kennedy’s damages testimony
 should have also been excluded from trial for a lack of com-
 parability and apportionment. Appellant Br. 34. Google
 does not dispute the technical comparability between the
 three licenses and Mr. Kennedy’s hypothetically negotiated
 agreement. Nor could it. Mr. Kennedy relied on the testi-
 mony of EcoFactor’s technical expert, Mr. De la Iglesia, for
 his opinion that the three license agreements were



      6  The dissent relies on a statement in the body of the
 of the Schneider and Daikin license agreements to support
 its position that the parties did not apply the $X royalty
 rate contained in these two license agreements’ whereas
 clauses. See Dissent 3–6. This statement provides that the
 agreed to lump sum “does not reflect or constitute a roy-
 alty.” J.A. 10391; J.A. 10402. That the lump sum amount
 is not a royalty does not mean the parties did not use the
 $X royalty rate discussed in the agreements to arrive at the
 lump sum amount. But even if we were to set aside these
 two license agreements, the Johnson license agreement
 alone would suffice. As Google’s own expert agreed at trial,
 “just one” license agreement can be sufficient to support a
 damages opinion. J.A. 6269 (1133:10–14). This assertion
 comports with our damages precedent, which does not de-
 mand “absolute precision” but may involve some degree of
 approximation and uncertainty. Virnetx, 767 F.3d at 1328.

 technically comparable to the hypothetically negotiated li-
 cense. J.A. 5578–5583 (442:22–447:2); J.A. 5763
 (627:7–23); J.A. 5768 (632:7–19). Google’s experts did not
 rebut Mr. De la Iglesia’s opinion on this issue at trial. J.A.

     Damages owed to the patentee must reflect the value
 of only the patented improvement—called apportionment.
 Omega Pats., LLC v. CalAmp Corp., 13 F.4th 1361, 1376
 (Fed. Cir. 2021). If a sufficiently comparable license is used
 for determining the appropriate reasonable royalty rate,
 further apportionment may not be required because the
 comparable license has built-in apportionment. Id. at
1377. “Built-in apportionment effectively assumes that the
 negotiators of a comparable license settled on a royalty rate
 and royalty base combination embodying the value of the
 asserted patent.” Id. (citation omitted). “For built-in ap-
 portionment to apply, the license must be sufficiently com-
 parable in that principles of apportionment were effectively
 baked into the purportedly comparable license.” Id. (cita-
 tion omitted). Part of this comparability analysis requires
 an expert to account “for differences in the technologies and
 economic circumstances of the contracting parties” to the
 past licenses and to the hypothetical negotiation at issue.

773 F.3d1201, 1227 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Finjan, 626 F.3d at 1211. For
 example, in Bio-Rad, we concluded that there was no abuse
 of discretion in allowing an expert to testify about three li-
 censes, even though one of the licenses was ultimately not
 proven to be technically comparable to the hypothetically
 negotiated license. 967 F.3d at 1374 (holding that the “‘de-
 gree of comparability’ was appropriately left for the jury to
 decide”).
      Here, Mr. Kennedy sufficiently showed, for purposes of
 admissibility, that the three license agreements were eco-
 nomically comparable to the hypothetically negotiated
 agreement. Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that, based on Mr.
 De la Iglesia’s unrebutted testimony, the Schneider and
 Daikin licenses list seven technically comparable asserted
 patents, including the ’327 patent at issue in the hypothet-
 ically negotiated agreement. See J.A. 10398; J.A. 10409.
 He also noted that the Johnson license did not list the ’327
 patent as an asserted patent but listed four others that cov-
 ered the same interrelated smart thermostat technologies.
 J.A. 10411; J.A. 1276. Finally, Mr. Kennedy acknowledged
 that the three licenses also covered patents in EcoFactor’s
 portfolio that were not asserted in the underlying litigation
 facing Johnson, Schneider, and Daikin. J.A. 10398;
 J.A. 10409; J.A. 10411; J.A. 1275–76.
     Mr. Kennedy accounted for such differences. Mr. Ken-
 nedy testified that in arriving at the $X royalty rate in a
 hypothetical negotiation, Google would argue that the
 three license agreements included EcoFactor’s portfolio,
 not just the ’327 patent, and thus the $X royalty rate
 should be decreased. J.A. 5767 (631:19–23). Mr. Kennedy
 then provided that the three license agreements reflect a
 settlement and thus the $X royalty rate reflects a risk that
 that EcoFactor’s patents would be found not infringed or
 invalid. J.A. 1276. According to Mr. Kennedy, this consid-
 eration would not be present at the hypothetical

 negotiation between EcoFactor and Google, since the as-
 sumption is that the ’327 patent was infringed and valid.
 J.A. 1276. As a result, this point would place upward pres-
 sure on the negotiated rate.
      The three licenses aside, Mr. Kennedy separately
 grounded his apportionment opinion on underlying inter-
 nal profit and survey data from Google. Mr. Kennedy tes-
 tified that, based on underlying customer surveys from
 Google and based on EcoFactor’s technical expert’s testi-
 mony, the infringed technology at issue in this case at-
 tributed to Z% 7 of the profits for the infringed products.
 J.A. 5755–5758 (619:16–622:13); J.A. 5775–5777
 (639:22–641:7). Based on this data, Mr. Kennedy calcu-
 lated the amount of profit per unit that could be attributed
 to the ’327 patent, which was more than double the $X roy-
 alty rate. J.A. 5755–5758 (619:16–622:13). According to
 Mr. Kennedy, this would also place upward pressure on the
 negotiated rate at the hypothetical negotiation. J.A. 5780
 (644:6–7) (“And that’s EcoFactor’s response, saying it
 should actually be a lot higher.”). Mr. Kennedy thus con-
 cluded that the $X royalty rate “would be a very reasonable
 and conservative first offer.” J.A. 5779 (643: 17–18). This
 testimony is additional evidence for the jury to consider
 and weigh when calculating a damages award. C & F Pack-
 ing, 224 F.3d at 1304; ResQNet.com, Inc., v. Lansa, Inc.,
 594 F.3d 860, 869 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“At all times, the dam-
 ages inquiry must concentrate on compensation for the eco-
 nomic harm caused by infringement of the claimed
 invention.”).
     Based on this evidence, we conclude that the district
 court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a
 new trial on damages. Mr. Kennedy’s damages opinion

 formation subject to a protective order, and as such, is not

 relied on sufficiently comparable licenses and his opinion
 sufficiently apportioned the value of the ’327 patent for the
 issue to be presented to the jury.
     Supporting our conclusion is ActiveVideo. There, the
 damages expert relied on an agreement that included the
 patents at issue and other software services without any
 alleged attempt to “disaggregate the value of the patent li-
 cense from the value of the services.” 694 F.3d at 1333 (ci-
 tation omitted). We held that there was no error in failing
 to exclude the expert’s testimony because the degree of
 comparability and “any failure on the part of [the] expert
 to control for certain variables are factual issues best ad-
 dressed by cross examination and not by exclusion.” Id.
 Here, Mr. Kennedy went further than the ActiveVideo ex-
 pert by sufficiently accounting for the economic differences
 between the patents in the three license agreements (as-
 serted and non-asserted) and the hypothetically negotiated
 agreement. And like in ActiveVideo, if there were any fail-
 ures to control for certain variables in comparability, these
 factual issues were for the jury to decide. Id.
     Contrary to Google’s position, our case law does not
 compel a contrary result. In Omega, we remanded for a
 new trial where the expert “merely identified . . . differ-
 ences” between the patents in the licenses and the patents
 in the hypothetical negotiation and did not distinguish
 such facts. 13 F.4th at 1380–81. In Apple, two of the three
 license agreements relied on by the expert did not list the
 subject patent all, and the third license listed the subject
 patent as a non-asserted patent in a long list of “hundreds
 of Non-Asserted patents.” Apple Inc. v. Wi-LAN Inc., 25
F.4th 960, 973 (Fed. Cir. 2022). We determined that there
 was no record evidence supporting the expert’s assumption
 that the subject patent was a “key patent” in these three
 licenses. Id.     Unlike in Omega and Apple, here we have two of the
 three licenses at issue explicitly listing the ’327 patent as

 an “asserted patent.” J.A. 10398; J.A. 10409. Additionally,
 Mr. Kennedy addressed and distinguished the remaining
 patents discussed in the license agreements. He testified
 that at the hypothetical negotiation, Google would empha-
 size the downward pressure that these patents would have
 on the $X royalty rate. Mr. Kennedy then testified that
 EcoFactor would note upward pressure on the $X royalty
 rate by assuming that the ’327 patent was valid and in-
 fringed. And, unlike in these cases, Mr. Kennedy sepa-
 rately rooted his apportionment analysis on underlying
 internal profit and survey data from Google. As previously
 noted, based on this data, Mr. Kennedy was able to deter-
 mine that the $X royalty rate was a conservative amount
 attributable to the ’327 patent.
     Google loses sight of the issue on appeal and the appli-
 cable standard of review. Our focus is on the admissibility
 of Mr. Kennedy’s damages testimony, and we assess the
 district court’s determination of this issue under the highly
 deferential abuse of discretion standard. “Credibility de-
 terminations, the weighing of the evidence, and the draw-
 ing of legitimate inferences from the facts” are jury
 functions, not those of a trial judge, and certainly not of an
 appellate judge. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods.,
 Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000) (citation omitted). If the
 standard for admissibility is raised too high, then the trial
 judge no longer acts as a gatekeeper but assumes the role
 of the jury.
      Based on the record before us, we conclude that the dis-
 trict court did not abuse its discretion when it denied
 Google’s motion for a new trial. Google has not shown that
 the district court’s decision to admit Mr. Kennedy’s dam-
 ages opinion resulted in prejudicial error or a substantial
 injustice requiring a new trial on damages.
                         CONCLUSION
     We have considered Google’s remaining arguments and
 find them unpersuasive. We reject Google’s attempt to

 PROST, Circuit Judge, dissenting-in-part.
     In recent years, our court has made some progress in
 clarifying important questions related to damages for pa-
 tent infringement. Such clarifications relate to deriving a
 reasonable royalty from a lump-sum license and requiring
 the patentee to confine its damages to the value of the pa-
 tented technology. Unfortunately, the majority opinion
 here at best muddles our precedent and at worst contra-
 dicts it. I therefore respectfully dissent from the decision

 to affirm the district court’s denial of Google’s motion for a
 new trial. 1
     Google argues that (1) Mr. Kennedy, EcoFactor’s dam-
 ages expert, calculated an $X royalty rate 2 from the Schnei-
 der, Daikin, and Johnson lump-sum licenses in an
 unreliable way; and (2) the $X rate in any event did not
 reflect the value of the ’327 patent (as distinct from that of
 other patents covered by those licenses). Google is right on
 both counts. The district court therefore, in my view,
 abused its discretion by not granting a new damages trial
 given Mr. Kennedy’s flawed testimony. 3
                                I
      Mr. Kennedy’s $X rate rests on EcoFactor’s self-serv-
 ing, unilateral “recitals” of its “beliefs” in the license agree-
 ments. These recitals are not only directly refuted by two
 of those same agreements; they also have no other support
 (e.g., sales data or other background testimony) to back
 them up. Our law does not allow damages to be so easily
 manufactured.
     When deriving reasonable royalties from lump-sum li-
 censes, we have emphasized that “lump sum payments . . .
 should not support running royalty rates without testi-
 mony explaining how they apply to the facts of the case.”


     1    I join the other aspects of the majority’s decision.
     2    Because the specific per-unit royalty rate that Mr.
 Kennedy uses has been designated confidential, I use $X to
 refer to his rate.
     3    When reviewing a district court’s exercise of discre-
 tion on a critical, often-complicated evidentiary decision
 such as a damages-expert Daubert, it usually helps to see
 the court’s explanation for its decision. Here, at both the
 Daubert stage and in the context of Google’s new-trial mo-
 tion, the district court gave no explanation. J.A. 2254,
 6687–89.

 Whitserve, LLC v. Comput. Packages, Inc., 694 F.3d 10, 30 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway,
 Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (requiring that
 “some basis for comparison must exist in the evidence pre-
 sented to the jury”). We have vacated damages awards
 where the derivation of a reasonable royalty from a lump
 sum was “incompatible with the . . . agreement as a whole,”
 MLC Intell. Prop., LLC v. Micron Tech., Inc., 10 F.4th 1358,
 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2021), where there was no testimony ex-
 plaining how lump-sum “payments could be converted to a
 royalty rate,” Whitserve, 694 F.3d at 30, and where “[n]ei-
 ther license describe[d] how the parties calculated each
 lump sum,” Wordtech Sys., Inc. v. Integrated Network Sols.,
 Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Mr. Kennedy’s
 $X rate repeats the same fatal errors we identified in MLC,
 Whitserve, and Wordtech. As in those cases, the licenses
 here are for a lump-sum amount with no record evidence
 supporting a calculation of a royalty rate.
      Consider what these licenses do (and do not) say.
 Starting with the Schneider license, one preliminary re-
 cital states: “WHEREAS EcoFactor represents that it has
 agreed to the payment set forth in this Agreement based
 on what [it] believes is a reasonable royalty calculation of
 [$X] per-unit for what it has estimated is past and pro-
 jected future sales of products accused of infringement in
 this Litigation.” J.A. 10400 (emphasis added). Yet the
 body of the license (i.e., its substantive and agreed upon
 terms and conditions)—which, unlike the recitals, reflects
 the view of both parties—says that its lump-sum payment
 “is not based upon sales and does not reflect or constitute a
 royalty.” J.A. 10402 (emphasis added).
     The Daikin and Johnson licenses both contain nearly
 identical preliminary recitals about the $X rate.
 J.A. 10389; J.A. 10411. As in the Schneider license, the
 body of the Daikin license—which, again, reflects the view
 of both parties—says that its lump-sum payment “is not
 based upon sales and does not reflect or constitute a

 royalty.” J.A. 10391 (emphasis added). And while the
 Johnson license lacks a similar refutation of the recital’s
 “belief” (a belief that, again, was EcoFactor’s alone), it still
 offers nothing more than the recital itself to support any
 royalty rate.
     These recitals became Mr. Kennedy’s $X rate.
 J.A. 5764 (628:10–17); J.A. 5769 (633:9–18); J.A. 5772–73
 (636:22–637:4). Mr. Kennedy also relied on the testimony
 of EcoFactor’s CEO, Mr. Habib, as support for this rate.
 J.A. 5794 (658:17–18). But Mr. Habib’s testimony does not
 establish anything beyond his unsupported “understand-
 ing” that these licenses used the $X royalty rate. See
 J.A. 5668–69 (532:23–533:2). When asked during direct
 examination about the basis for his “understanding,” Mr.
 Habib testified that he was not allowed to see any underly-
 ing financial information or sales data. J.A. 5670 (534:4–
 14). Mr. Habib also explained his basis for believing that
 the $X rate was a reasonable rate based on his understand-
 ing of the market, J.A. 5672 (536:14–24), but his market-
 based testimony provided no explanation for converting
 from the lump-sum payments in these licenses to any roy-
 alty rate, let alone the $X royalty rate. 4
     On this record, it’s impossible to establish that these
 lump-sum payments were calculated using any royalty
 rate, let alone the specific $X rate. The self-serving recitals
 reflect only EcoFactor’s transparent attempt to


     4   The only other basis Mr. Habib offers is that the $X
 royalty rate was EcoFactor’s baseline policy for licensing,
 regardless of the number of patents. J.A. 5671 (535:12–
 24). Understandably, neither the majority nor EcoFactor
 rely on the baseline policy as a valid basis for Mr. Habib’s
 understanding that the $X rate was used. See Omega
 Pats., LLC v. CalAmp Corp., 13 F.4th 1361, 1379–80 (Fed.
 Cir. 2021) (concluding that a comparable license analysis
 using a baseline royalty rate policy is unreliable).

 manufacture a royalty rate using its “belief.” EcoFactor
 even had to refute its “belief” by agreeing, in the Schneider
 and Daikin licenses, that the lump-sum payment is not a
 royalty. Mr. Kennedy’s assertion that the Schneider and
 Daikin licenses used the $X rate is “incompatible with the
 . . . agreement[s] as a whole.” MLC Intell. Prop., 10 F.4th
 at 1368. And the Johnson license does not “describe how
 the parties calculated [the] lump sum.” Wordtech Sys., 
609F.3d at 1320.
     Mr. Kennedy cited nothing else showing that the $X
 rate was actually used. He cited no documents, records,
 sales data, or testimony showing any calculation of the
 lump-sum payments or otherwise establishing that these
 licenses used the $X rate. Mr. Habib’s testimony, relying
 on no underlying data, likewise offers no support. EcoFac-
 tor offered no testimony explaining how the lump-sum
 “payments could be converted to a royalty rate.” Whitserve,
 694 F.3d at 30.
     At bottom, all we have are the recitals of one party’s
 “beliefs” contradicted by mutually agreed upon contractual
 language by both parties. That’s not enough under our law.
      None of the majority’s responses on this issue with-
 stand scrutiny. The majority first insists that the Schnei-
 der and Daikin licenses do not disclaim the $X royalty rate.
 It reasons, “[t]hat the lump sum amount is not a royalty
 does not mean [that] the parties did not use the $X royalty
 rate discussed in the agreements to arrive at the lump sum
 amount.” Maj. 14 n.6 (emphasis in original). If the major-
 ity’s point is that a lump sum is not itself a royalty, then
 fair enough—no one disputes that truism. The issue here,
 however, is whether the lump sum in these licenses reflects
 the application of the $X royalty rate (or, in the majority’s
 words, whether it was used “to arrive at the lump sum
 amount”). And the majority cannot credibly claim that was
 the case when the licenses themselves say that each lump-
 sum payment “is not based upon sales and does not reflect

 6                              ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 or constitute a royalty.” J.A. 10391, 10402 (emphasis
 added). I’m not sure how these licenses could more clearly
 establish that the lump sums were not calculated using
 royalties.
     The majority next asserts that “the Johnson license
 agreement alone would suffice.” Maj. 14 n.6. But the John-
 son license contains no language describing how its lump-
 sum payment was calculated, see Wordtech Sys., 
609 F.3dat 1320, and Mr. Kennedy offered no other basis from
 which he could conclude that the Johnson license used the
 $X rate.
     The majority also cites an email chain that purportedly
 concerns the use of the $X rate in the Johnson license. But
 Mr. Kennedy never discussed this email; EcoFactor intro-
 duced this email during the cross-examination of Google’s
 expert. J.A. 6278 (1142:3–10). The question here is not
 whether any document in the record supports the jury’s
 damages award. We are instead asking whether Mr. Ken-
 nedy’s testimony was so unreliable that it requires a new
 trial. I can’t see how an email Mr. Kennedy never ad-
 dressed supports the reliability of his analysis.
     In the end, Mr. Kennedy conjured the $X rate from
 nothing, and the majority’s treatment of his analysis can-
 not be squared with our law or the facts.
                               II
     Even if these licenses used the $X rate, Mr. Kennedy’s
 analysis has another significant problem: the $X rate does
 not reflect the ’327 patent’s value; rather, it includes the
 value of other patents. Our law is clear that this basic fail-
 ure requires a new trial.

 sonable royalty, we require a party to account for differ-
 ences in the technologies and economic circumstances of
 the contracting parties.” Apple Inc. v. Wi-LAN Inc., 25

 accounting, although not overly rigid and involving approx-
 imation, requires apportioning to just the value of patent(s)
 in the hypothetical negotiation. Omega Pats., LLC v.
 CalAmp Corp., 13 F.4th 1361, 1380–81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
 This apportionment must be tied to the facts of each case.
 Id. at 1379–80.
     The licenses here have a broad scope. Each license is
 to “all patents and patent applications (along with patents
 issuing thereon) . . . that are now, or ever come to be, as-
 signed to, owned by, or controlled by EcoFactor.”
 J.A. 10390; J.A. 10401; J.A. 10412. Because each license
 reflects a settlement, they also list the patents asserted in
 each underlying litigation. The Schneider and Daikin li-
 censes list seven asserted patents, including the ’327 pa-
 tent. J.A. 10398, 10409. The Johnson license lists four
 asserted patents; none are the ’327 patent. J.A. 10411.
     When calculating the ’327 patent’s value, Mr. Kennedy
 relied on EcoFactor’s technical expert, Mr. de la Iglesia,
 who compared the asserted patents in each license to the
 ’327 patent and concluded that the asserted patents and
 the ’327 patent were technologically comparable. J.A.
 5578–82 (442:14–446:10). But EcoFactor’s technical expert
 didn’t discuss the remaining patents in each license—the
 non-asserted patents in EcoFactor’s portfolio. 5 Rather, Mr.
 Kennedy explained that since, “in the real world,” “the rest
 of the patents are thrown in usually either for nothing or
 very little additional value,” the presence of these non-as-
 serted patents would place “downward pressure on the roy-
 alty rate” in a hypothetical negotiation over the ’327




     5    Although we don’t know the exact size of EcoFac-
 tor’s portfolio, at least one document suggests that EcoFac-
 tor’s portfolio is over three times larger than the seven
 asserted patents in the Schneider and Daikin licenses.

 patent. J.A. 5767–68 (631:22–632:2); see also J.A. 5771–72
 (635:19–636:3).
      Mr. Kennedy’s opinion is “untethered to the facts of
 this case.” Apple, 25 F.4th at 973. His generic testimony
 about “the real world,” general industry practice, and
 “downward pressure” does not account for the impact of
 EcoFactor’s specific non-asserted patents, and we don’t
 know whether any non-asserted patent in EcoFactor’s port-
 folio covers the same technological areas as the asserted
 patents. Mr. Kennedy did not ask the necessary question
 under our law—what effect the specific non-asserted pa-
 tents in EcoFactor’s portfolio would have on the hypothet-
 ical negotiation. 6 Even worse, other evidence in the record
 indicates that the specific non-asserted patents were not
 considered at all. Mr. Habib testified that the remaining
 patents in EcoFactor’s portfolio had no effect on the rate
 used in these licenses because the $X rate was EcoFactor’s
 baseline policy. J.A. 5671 (535:12–24).
     In the end, Mr. Kennedy’s circumstance-agnostic anal-
 ysis is insufficient under our law. Apple, 25 F.4th at 973
 (vacating a verdict where the same expert as in this case,
 Mr. Kennedy, testified that excluding the non-asserted pa-
 tents in a portfolio license would reduce the royalty rate by
 25 percent as a matter of industry practice); Omega Pats.,
 13 F.4th at 1379 (vacating a verdict where the proposed
 $5.00 royalty rate was the same for any number of patents);
 MLC Intell. Prop., 10 F.4th at 1375 (vacating a verdict




     6  It would not be difficult for EcoFactor to offer an
 answer. For example, Mr. de la Iglesia could have deter-
 mined that the non-asserted patents in the Schneider, Dai-
 kin, and Johnson licenses have no technological overlap
 with the ’327 patent and concluded that the non-asserted
 patents added only nominal value to the license.

 where no evidence or explanation supported using the roy-
 alty rate in a forty-one-patent license for a single patent).
      The majority, in excusing Mr. Kennedy’s failure to
 properly apportion, ignores our law’s requirements. It
 merely states that Mr. Kennedy “acknowledged that the
 three licenses also covered patents not in EcoFactor’s port-
 folio.” Maj. 16. But the majority ignores the key fail-
 ure—Mr. Kennedy failed to account for the impact of the
 specific remaining patents in EcoFactor’s portfolio, other
 than by referencing a generic “downward pressure.” Nei-
 ther Mr. Kennedy nor Mr. de la Iglesia tied this “downward
 pressure” to the specific non-asserted patents, and Mr.
 Habib affirmatively testified that EcoFactor’s practice was
 to use the same $X rate regardless of the number of pa-
 tents. In these circumstances, I “fail to see how this pa-
 tent/claim-independent       approach      accounts      for
 apportionment.” Omega Pats., 13 F.4th at 1379.
      The majority also relies on ActiveVideo Networks, Inc.
 v. Verizon Communications, Inc., 694 F.3d 1312 (Fed. Cir.
 2012), for its conclusion. But in ActiveVideo, we concluded
 that “disagreements . . . with the conclusions reached by
 ActiveVideo’s experts and the factual assumptions and con-
 siderations underlying those conclusions” were “factual is-
 sues best addressed by cross examination and not
 exclusion.” Id. at 1333. Our conclusion presupposed that
 “the methodology is sound” and that “the evidence relied
 upon [is] sufficiently related to the case at hand.” i4i Ltd.
 P’Ship v. Microsoft Corp., 598 F.3d 831, 852 (Fed. Cir.
 2010), aff’d, 564 U.S. 91 (2011). As I explained above,
 that’s far from the case here. And to the extent the major-
 ity relies on one party’s characterization in ActiveVideo of
 the expert’s opinion as failing to “disaggregate the value of
 the patent license from the value of the services,” Maj. 18,
 we did not adopt that characterization of the expert’s opin-
 ion, see ActiveVideo, 694 F.3d at 1333. Additionally, any
 suggestion that disaggregating the value of the patented
 technology from the overall value of a license is not

 10                             ECOFACTOR, INC. v. GOOGLE LLC




 required is flatly inconsistent with our law and 140 years
 of Supreme Court precedent. See VirnetX, Inc. v. Cisco
 Sys., Inc., 767 F.3d 1308, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“[A] pa-
 tentee ‘must in every case give evidence tending to sepa-
 rate or apportion the defendant’s profits and the patentee’s
 damages between the patented feature and the unpatented
 features.’” (quoting Garretson v. Clark, 111 U.S. 120, 121 (1884))).
     To establish a purportedly independent basis for Mr.
 Kennedy’s conclusion, the majority asserts that he demon-
 strated the reasonableness of his $X rate by analyzing
 Google’s profits. Maj. 17. Mr. Kennedy determined what
 profits on Google’s accused Nest thermostats came from
 features that he maintained were attributable to the ’327
 patent. He then split the profits between Google and Eco-
 Factor, using the $X rate as a reasonable basis. See J.A.
 5778 (642:13–17). His methodology isn’t reasonable. Ra-
 ther than offering a cross-check, Mr. Kennedy’s circular
 profit analysis begins and ends with the same “fundamen-
 tally flawed premise”—the $X rate. Uniloc USA, Inc. v.
 Microsoft Corp., 632 F.3d 1292, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2011).
     Ultimately, the majority’s real concern is that, “[i]f the
 standard for admissibility is raised too high, then the trial
 judge no longer acts as the gatekeeper but assumes the role
 of the jury.” Maj. 19. But we must pay close attention to
 the reliability of the methodology underlying expert testi-
 mony to ensure that the jury can fulfill its proper role as
 the factfinder. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 
522 U.S. 136,142 (1997) (emphasizing the district court’s “gatekeeper”
 role in “screening” expert testimony). As the Supreme
 Court has recognized, “the expert’s testimony often will
 rest upon an experience confessedly foreign in kind to the
 jury’s own.” Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 
526 U.S. 137,149 (1999) (cleaned up). Thus, an “effort to assure that the
 specialized testimony is reliable and relevant can help the
 jury evaluate that foreign experience.” Id. Our damages
 law ensures that an expert asks the right questions. Many

 admissible answers to these questions are possible, and it
 is those answers that are subject to the crucible of cross-
 examination. Mr. Kennedy failed to ask the right ques-
 tions at multiple junctures. The majority’s decision to over-
 look the prejudicial impact of his unreliable testimony
 abdicates its responsibility as a gatekeeper and contradicts
 our precedent.
                              III
      Mr. Kennedy’s analysis is unreliable. His $X rate has
 no basis in the record, and his $X rate does not reflect the
 ’327 patent’s value alone but instead includes the value of
 other patents. Mr. Kennedy’s testimony did not meet the
 baseline standards of admissibility, and therefore the dis-
 trict court abused its discretion by not granting a new trial
 on damages. The majority’s conclusion otherwise departs
 from our law. I respectfully dissent.","https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9510518/ecofactor-inc-v-google-llc/?type=o&type=o&q=google&order_by=score+desc","{

                          SUMMARY *


                        Data Collection

    The panel reversed the district court’s summary
judgment in favor of Google, LLC, in a class action alleging
that the company surreptitiously collected users’ data in
violation of various state and federal laws, and remanded for
further proceedings.
    Plaintiffs are a group of Google Chrome users who chose
not to sync their Chrome browsers with their Google
accounts while browsing the web. As they allege in their
complaint, Plaintiffs believed, based on the terms of
Google’s Chrome Privacy Notice, that their choice not to
sync Chrome with their Google accounts meant that certain
personal information would not be collected and used by
Google. The district court held that Google successfully
proved that Plaintiffs consented to its data collection.
    The panel explained that the district court should have
reviewed the terms of Google’s various disclosures and
decided whether a reasonable user reading them would think
that he or she was consenting to the data collection. By
focusing on “browser agnosticism” instead of conducting the
reasonable person inquiry, the district court failed to apply
the correct standard. Viewed in the light most favorable to
Plaintiffs, browser agnosticism is irrelevant because nothing
in Google’s disclosures is tied to what other browsers do.

 This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has
been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.
                  CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                   3


    Because applying the correct standard reveals disputes
of material fact regarding whether “reasonable” users of
Google’s product consented to Google’s data collection
practices, the panel remanded the issue of consent—
assuming a plaintiff class is certified—to the district court
for trial.

                         OPINION

M. SMITH, Circuit Judge:

    Plaintiff-Appellants Patrick Calhoun, Elaine Crespo,
Michael Henry, Cornice Wilson, Rodney Johnson, and
Claudia Kindler brought this class action lawsuit against
Defendant-Appellee Google, LLC, alleging that the
company surreptitiously collected users’ data in violation of
various state and federal laws. The district court granted
summary judgment in favor of Google, holding that Google
had successfully proven that Plaintiffs consented to its data
collection. For the reasons explained below, we reverse and
remand.
  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
    Plaintiffs are a group of Google Chrome users who
“chose not to ‘Sync’ their [Chrome] browsers with their
Google accounts while browsing the web from July 27, 2016
to the present.” As they allege in their complaint, Plaintiffs
believed that their choice not to sync Chrome with their
Google accounts meant that certain “personal information”
would not be collected and used by Google. Their belief was
based on the terms of Google’s “Chrome Privacy Notice,”
which “describes features that are specific to Chrome,” and
states in relevant part:

       You don’t need to provide any personal
       information to use Chrome, but Chrome has

       anonymized and aggregated with data from
       other users . . .

Notwithstanding the above statements, Plaintiffs allege that
“Google intentionally and unlawfully causes Chrome to
record and send users’ personal information to Google
regardless of whether a user elects to Sync or even has a
Google account.”      Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that
“Chrome sends the following personal information to
Google when a user exchanges communications with any
website that includes Google surveillance source code—

again, regardless of whether a user is logged-in to Google

         a. The user’s unique, persistent cookie 1
         identifiers;
         b. The user’s browsing history in the form of
         the contents of the users’ GET requests 2 and
         information relating to the substance,
         purport, or meaning of the website’s portion
         of the communication with the user;
         c. In many cases, the contents of the users’
         POST 3 communications;
         d. The user’s IP address 4 and User-Agent
         information about their device; and
         e. The user’s x-client-data identifier. 5

    A. Motion to Dismiss
    At the motion to dismiss stage, Google did not deny
collecting Plaintiffs’ data while using Chrome in an un-
synced mode. Instead, it asserted that Plaintiffs consented to
this data collection when they agreed to Google’s Privacy
Policy, 6 which policy is cross-referenced in the part of the
Chrome Privacy Notice discussing “Sign-in and Sync
Chrome modes.” Google argued that the Policy “disclosed
the alleged data collection” per the following terms:

        We collect information about the services
        that you use and how you use them, like when
        you . . . visit a website that uses our
        advertising services, or view and interact
        with our ads and content.
        This information includes: . . . device-
        specific information . . .
        When you use our services or view content
        provided by Google, we automatically collect
        and store certain information in server logs,
        [including] details of how you used our
        service, such as your search queries . . .
        device event information such as . . . the date
        and time of your request and referral URL
        [and] cookies that may uniquely identify your
        browser or your Google Account.




6
  The Privacy Policy is incorporated in Google’s Terms of Service
(TOS), which all Plaintiffs agreed to.
10                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


While the district court recognized that consent is a valid
legal defense to Plaintiffs’ claims, it rejected Google’s
arguments that it had met its burden to establish the defense.
    First, the court noted that Google’s General Terms of
Service (TOS), which incorporates the Privacy Policy, states
that where “these terms conflict with the service-specific
additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that
service.” It further noted that the Privacy Policy directed
readers to “additional terms for particular services,” and
included a hyperlink to the Chrome Privacy Notice. These
statements—combined with Google’s more specific
representation in the Chrome Privacy Notice that “the
personal information that Chrome stores won’t be sent to
Google unless you . . . turn[] on sync”—led the court to
conclude that a reasonable user would not think they were
consenting to the data collection at issue. The court noted
that a reasonable user viewing these disclosures might think
“that if he or she used Chrome without sync, his or her
personal information would not be sent to Google.”
    Second, the court rejected Google’s argument that the
Chrome Privacy Notice was accurate regarding how Google
would treat “the personal information that Chrome stores”
because “readers would understand that ‘the personal
information that Chrome stores’” does not include the data
collection at issue in this case. The court rejected this
argument because the data collection “falls within the
definition of personal information under California law,
which governs Google’s [TOS],” and the terms of Google’s
own privacy policy.
    In sum, the court concluded that “Google cannot show
that Plaintiffs expressly consented to Google’s collection of
data,” and that “[t]o the contrary, Google’s representations
                    CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                      11


might have led a reasonable user to believe that Google did
not collect his or her personal information when the user was
not synced.” It thus denied Google’s motion to dismiss on
its consent defense. 7
    B. Motion for Summary Judgment
   Google moved for summary judgment. In its summary
judgment briefing, Google introduced two additional notices
in support of its consent defense: the “Consent Bump
Agreement,” which it launched in June 2016, and the “New
Account Creation Agreement,” updated in June 2016.
    The “Consent Bump Agreement” “is a push down banner
that Google showed to account holders either when they
visited a ‘Google owned-and-operated property’ while
signed into their account or when users signed into their
account for the first time after June 2016.” It reads in
relevant part:

        [W]hen you use[] Google services like
        Search and YouTube, you generate data—
        things like what you’ve searched for and
        videos you’ve watched. You can find and
        control that data in My Account under the
        Web & App Activity setting. With this
        change, this setting may also include
        browsing data from Chrome and activity
        from sites and apps that partner with Google,
        including those that show ads from Google.


7
  This case was originally assigned to Judge Lucy H. Koh. After the
motion to dismiss order was issued, however, Judge Koh was elevated
to the Ninth Circuit, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was assigned
to adjudicate the case.
12                  CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


The “New Account Creation Agreement” incorporates the
Privacy Policy, and states:

        When you search for a restaurant on Google
        Maps or watch a video on YouTube, for
        example, we process information about that
        activity—including information like the
        video you watched, device IDs, IP addresses,
        cookie data, and location.
        We also process the kinds of information
        described above when you use apps or sites
        that use Google services like ads, Analytics,
        and the YouTube video player . . .
        We also combine data among our services
        and across your devices for these purposes.

The district court referred to these agreements, along with
the Privacy Policy, collectively, as “Google’s general
policies” to distinguish them from the Chrome-specific
Privacy Notice.
    Assuming that only Google’s “general policies” or the
Chrome Privacy Notice could govern Google’s conduct in
this case, the court identified the threshold issue at summary
judgment as “which agreement controls the at-issue data
collection.” “Plaintiffs contend[ed] that the Chrome Privacy
Notice applie[d] because they are Chrome users using the
Chrome browser.” “Google . . . argue[d] that because the
data collection at issue . . . is ‘browser-agnostic,’ Google’s
general policies apply.”
    After holding a lengthy evidentiary hearing on the issue,
the court found that the collection of data listed in Plaintiffs’
complaint (the “at-issue data” collection) was “browser-
                      CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                           13


agnostic,” except for the X-client-data-header. 8 In other
words, the court found that the data Plaintiffs complained
was improperly collected was “transmitted to Google
regardless of the browser used.”
    The court then explained the significance of the
“browser-agnostic” finding: “Because the Court finds that
the at-issue data collected is not specific to Chrome but
browser agnostic, the Court also finds that Google’s general
policies apply.” “More specifically, the General Privacy
Policy, New Account Creation Agreement, and Consent
Bump Agreement governs the collection of those categories
of information identified by plaintiffs.”
    The district court then explained that all Plaintiffs had
consented to the general Privacy Policy, and at least some
had agreed to the Consent Bump Agreement and the New
Account Creation Agreement. Based on the terms of these
agreements, the district court explained that “a reasonable
person viewing those disclosures would understand that
Google maintains the practices of (a) collecting its users’
data when users use Google services or third party sites that
use Google’s services and (b) that Google uses the data for
advertising purposes.”
    Finally, the district court rejected Plaintiffs’ arguments
to the contrary. Most notably, the district court held that the
Chrome Privacy Notice did “not negate []” Plaintiffs’
consent to the general policies outlined above. The district

     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW
    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We
review de novo the district court’s summary judgment order.
2-Bar Ranch Ltd. P’ship v. U.S. Forest Serv., 996 F.3d 984,
990 (9th Cir. 2021).
                            ANALYSIS
    At summary judgment, the following causes of action
remained: (1) violation of the California Invasion of Privacy
Act; (2) intrusion upon seclusion; (3) breach of contract;
(4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (5) statutory larceny; and (6) violation of
California’s Unfair Competition Law. The parties do not
dispute that consent is a valid defense to these claims, and
that the contours of the defense as established in the
Restatement (Second) of Torts. 10 and in state law are as
follows.
    First, consent “can be [express] or implied, but any
consent must be actual.” In re Google Inc., No. 13-MD-
02430-LHK, 2013 WL 5423918, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26,
2013) (citing United States v. Van Poyck, 77 F.3d 285, 292(9th Cir. 1996)); see also Pinnacle Museum Tower Ass’n v.
Pinnacle Mkt. Dev. (US), LLC, 282 P.3d 1217, 1224 (Cal.
2012) (stating that general principles of contract law include


9
 The district court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification as
moot.
 California courts are generally guided by the principles outlined in the
10

Restatement (Second) of Torts. See, e.g., Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed
Martin Corp., 63 P.3d 937, 951 (Cal. 2003).
                   CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                  15


express or implied consent). For consent to be actual, the
disclosures must “explicitly notify” users of the conduct at
issue. In re Google Inc., 2013 WL 5423918, at *13.
Moreover, “[c]onsent is only effective if the person alleging
harm consented ‘to the particular conduct, or to substantially
the same conduct’ and if the alleged tortfeasor did not exceed
the scope of that consent.” Tsao v. Desert Palace, Inc., 
698F.3d 1128, 1149 (9th Cir. 2012) (“To be effective, consent
must be . . . to the particular conduct, or substantially the
same conduct.”) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts
§ 892A(2)(b) (1979))).
    The parties agree that consent is “an affirmative defense
for which defendant bears the burden of proof.” Van Patten
v. Vertical Fitness Grp., LLC, 847 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir.
2017). In determining consent, courts consider “whether the
circumstances, considered as a whole, demonstrate that a
reasonable person understood that an action would be carried
out so that their acquiescence demonstrates knowing
authorization.” Smith v. Facebook, Inc., 745 F. App’x 8, 8
(9th Cir. 2018). See, e.g., Long v. Provide Com., Inc., 
200Cal. Rptr. 3d 117, 125 (Ct. App. 2016) (disagreeing that a
“hyperlink was sufficiently conspicuous to ‘put a reasonable
user on notice of the Terms of Use’”). If that user could have
plausibly understood the disclosures “as not disclosing that
[the defendant] would engage in particular conduct,” then
the disclosures are insufficient to establish consent. In re
Facebook, Inc., Consumer Priv. User Profile Litig., 402 F.
Supp. 3d 767, 789 (N.D. Cal. 2019).
    Before the district court, Plaintiffs had argued that they
did not consent to Google’s conduct because a reasonable
user viewing the disclosures would not have concluded that
they unambiguously disclosed the data collection at issue.
See, e.g., Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Summary Judgment,
16                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


Calhoun v. Google, 5:20-cv-05146, at 5-6 (Jan. 2, 2022).
Specifically, Plaintiffs asserted that the explicit statements
in the Chrome Privacy Notice would actually give a
reasonable user the opposite impression regarding Google’s
data collection practices. Further, Plaintiffs argued that—to
the extent Google relied on the Privacy Policy to argue
otherwise—that Policy also contained statements in favor of
Plaintiffs’ interpretation, such as: “the activity information
we collect may include . . . Chrome browsing history you’ve
synced with your Google Account,” and “[y]our Chrome
browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve
enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google
Account.”
    Google argues that the General Privacy Policy addresses
the “at-issue” data, such as IP addresses and cookies, while
the Chrome Privacy Notice reference to “personal
information” addresses only Sync-enabled data like
browsing history, bookmarks, tabs, passwords and autofill
information, and other browser settings. But the parties
dispute whether a reasonable person would understand, in
the context of all of Google’s representations in its privacy
policies, what “personal information” means.
    Plaintiffs also argue that Google’s Chrome Privacy
Notice also makes representations about data collection
beyond Sync-enabled data. For example, the Chrome
Privacy Notice states that “[y]ou don’t need to provide any
personal information to use Chrome” and that “[p]rivacy
practices are different depending on the mode you’re using.”
It goes on to state that in “Basic browser mode,” information
such as passwords and “cookies or data from websites that
you visit” are stored locally on a user’s system. The Notice
then provides that “[t]he personal information that Chrome
stores won’t be sent to Google unless you . . . turn[] on
                   CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                    17


sync.” Although Google argues that the reference to
“personal information” is sufficient to indicate which subset
of data the Notice controls, together, these statements could
suggest that the “personal information” the Chrome Privacy
Notice addresses includes cookies and IP addresses.
    Based on these arguments, the district court should have
reviewed the terms of the various disclosures and decided
whether a reasonable user reading them would think that he
or she was consenting to the data collection, which collection
Google has not disputed. See, e.g., In re Facebook, Inc.
Internet Tracking Litig., 956 F.3d 589, 602 (9th Cir. 2020)
(identifying “the relevant question” as “whether a user
would reasonably expect that Facebook would have access
to the user’s individual data,” and reviewing the terms of
“Facebook’s privacy disclosures” to answer that question).
    However, rather than trying to determine how a
reasonable user would understand Google’s various privacy
policies, the district court held a 7.5-hour evidentiary hearing
which included expert testimony about “whether the data-
collection at issue [is] . . . browser-agnostic.” The district
court thus made the case turn on a technical distinction
unfamiliar to most “reasonable user[s].” If “the data
collection at-issue [wa]s specific to Chrome,” the court
believed, then the Chrome-specific promises in the Chrome
Privacy Notice applied. But if it was “browser-agnostic”—
if Google collected the same data from non-Chrome
browsers—then all that mattered were the company’s
generalized statements in the terms of service and Privacy
Policy.
    Having determined that the data collection was “browser
agnostic,” the district court held that Plaintiffs consented to
this collection when they agreed to Google’s general privacy
18                    CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


policies, because under the “browser agnostic terms” of
those policies, the data collection was disclosed. The district
court therefore did not consider the terms of the Chrome
Policy Notice in its analysis. To the extent the district court
considered those terms at all, it only mentioned them to say
they did not “negate” Plaintiffs’ consent.
    By focusing on “browser agnosticism” instead of
conducting the reasonable person inquiry, the district court
failed to apply the correct standard, despite its recitation of
it. Viewing this in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs,
browser agnosticism is irrelevant because nothing in
Google’s disclosures is tied to what other browsers do. And
that is because the governing standard is what a “reasonable
user” of a service would understand they were consenting to,
not what a technical expert would.
    To resist this conclusion, Google cites our unpublished
decision in Smith to argue that the district court did not err.
The Smith panel held that “[a] reasonable person viewing
[Facebook’s] disclosures would understand that Facebook
maintains” certain data collection practices based on the
terms of its disclosures. 11 Smith, 745 F. App’x at 8-9.
Google argues that the reasoning in Smith applies here
because “[t]he transmissions at issue in Smith were
materially indistinguishable from those in this case.”



11
  The relevant disclosure in Smith stated: “We collect information when
you visit or use third-party websites and apps that use our Services . . .
This includes information about the websites and apps you visit, your
use of our Services on those websites and apps, as well as information
the developer or publisher of the app or website provides to you or us,”
and “we use all of the information we have about you to show you
relevant ads.” Smith, 745 F. App’x at 8.
                      CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                           19


    But the panel in Smith did not hold that plaintiffs
consented to the data collection because it determined that
the data collection at issue was “agnostic.” Rather, it held
that plaintiffs consented to the data collection because,
analyzing the terms of Facebook’s Terms and Policies, “a
reasonable person viewing those disclosures would
understand” that Facebook engaged in the contested
practices. Id.
    More to the point, Smith, and our recent unpublished
decision in Hammerling v. Google, LLC, No. 22-17024,
2024 WL 937247, at *2 (9th Cir. Mar. 5, 2024) 12 are
inapposite, because plaintiffs in those cases had not argued
that Facebook or Google had service-specific privacy
policies that could reasonably be read to say the opposite of
what its general privacy policies disclosed. The panel in
Smith, for example, specifically explained that Facebook
was not bound by the contrary assurances of other websites’
policies because “Facebook’s Terms and Policies make no
such assurance, and Facebook is not bound by promises it
did not make.” Smith, 745 F. App’x at 9. By contrast, and
at least in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, Google did
make a promise in its Chrome Privacy Policy that it would
not collect certain information absent a user’s voluntary
decision to sync, so Google may be “bound by [those]
promises.” Id.
    Google’s “affirmative statement that it would not receive
information” in its Chrome Privacy Notice puts this case
more in line with Internet Tracking Litigation than with
Smith or Hammerling. Internet Tracking Litig., 956 F.3d at
603. There, a panel of our court reversed a district court’s

12
  Google filed a 28(j) letter notifying the court about this March 4, 2024
unpublished decision.
20                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


decision to dismiss a complaint in which users of Facebook
alleged that the social media site continued to collect their
data even after they had logged out. Id. at 596. The panel
began by assessing “whether a user would reasonably expect
that Facebook would have access to the user’s individual
data after the user logged out of the application.” Id. at 602.
It did this by reviewing Facebook’s various “privacy
disclosures” id., rather than looking at browser agnosticism.
    The panel noted that Facebook’s general Data Use Policy
stated that Facebook “receive[s] data whenever you visit a
game, application or website that uses [Facebook’s
services].” Id. To the extent the policy mentioned log in/log
out, it stated that the data collection could include “the date
and time you visit the site; the web address, . . . and, if you
are logged in to Facebook, your user ID.” Id. (emphasis
omitted). The panel also noted that Facebook’s “Help
Center” answered the more specific question of data
collection at log in/log out: “[i]f you are logged into
Facebook, we also see your user ID number and email
address. . . . If you log out of Facebook, we will not receive
this information about partner websites but you will also not
see personalized experiences on these sites.” Id. Based on
these disclosures—including the applicable Help Center
page which “affirmatively stated that logged-out user data
would not be collected,”—the panel held that a reasonable
user would not necessarily expect that Facebook would have
access to the data after logging out of the site. Id.
    Discussing other cases on this topic, the panel noted:
“[t]hat users in those cases explicitly denied consent does not
render those cases distinguishable from the instant case,
given Facebook’s affirmative statements that it would not
receive information from third-party websites after users had
logged out. Indeed, in those cases, the critical fact was that
                    CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC                    21


the online entity represented to the plaintiffs that their
information would not be collected, but then proceeded to
collect it anyway.” Id. at 603 (discussing In re Google Inc.
Cookie Placement Consumer Priv. Litig., 
806 F.3d 125, 129,151 (3d Cir. 2015) and In re Nickelodeon Cons. Priv. Litig.,
827 F.3d 262, 293–94 (3d Cir. 2016)).
    Here, Google’s general Privacy Policy broadly states
“that Google collects data about users’ ‘[a]ctivity on third-
party sites and apps that use [Google’s] services.’”
Hammerling, 2024 WL 937247, at *1 (analyzing same
Privacy Policy). Like the general policy in Facebook which
only briefly discussed the log in/log out distinction, the
Privacy Policy here only briefly mentions the sync/non-sync
distinction. Like the “Help Center” in Facebook, the
Chrome Privacy Notice includes more detail on the
distinctions between Chrome browsing modes, and includes
an “affirmative statement[] that it would not receive
information,” Internet Tracking Litig., 956 F.3d at 603, from
users “unless you choose to . . . turn[] on sync.” Thus, when
the disclosures are read together and in the light most
favorable to Plaintiffs, a reasonable user would not
necessarily understand that they were consenting to the data
collection at issue. It was the district court’s failure to apply
the correct standard that led to the opposite conclusion.
    This point is illustrated by the outcome of a related case,
Brown v. Google LLC, 685 F. Supp. 3d 909, 930 (N.D. Cal.
2023). In Brown, the same district court presided over a
related class action lawsuit brought by users of Google
Chrome’s “incognito” mode. Id. at 919. As in this case,
plaintiffs alleged that Google surreptitiously collected their
data, notwithstanding statements in the same Chrome
Privacy Notice (and on the incognito splash screen) that
within Incognito mode “Chrome won’t store certain
22                 CALHOUN V. GOOGLE, LLC


information.” Id. at 930. As in this case, Google asserted
that the Brown plaintiffs consented to the Privacy Policy,
which Policy disclosed the data collection challenged. Id. at
926.
     But unlike in this case, the district court rejected
Google’s “agnosticism” reasoning, instead properly turning
to the disclosures at issue and assessing whether a reasonable
user reading them might believe they were consenting to
certain practices. Brown, 685 F. Supp. 3d at 927-28.
    Here, Google had a general privacy disclosure yet
promoted Chrome by suggesting that certain information
would not be sent to Google unless a user turned on sync.
Thus, “Google itself created a situation where there is a
dispute as to whether users’ consent of Google’s data
collection generally is ‘substantially the same’ as their
consent to the collection of their [non-synced] data in
particular.” Id. at 928.
    Whether a “reasonable” user of Google’s computer
software at issue in this case consented to a particular data
collection practice is not to be determined by attributing to
that user the skill of an experienced business lawyer or
someone who is able to easily ferret through a labyrinth of
legal jargon to understand what he or she is consenting to.
Instead, a determination of what a “reasonable” user would
have understood must take into account the level of
sophistication attributable to the general public, which uses
Google’s services.
    Because applying the correct standard reveals disputes
of material fact regarding whether “reasonable” users of
Google’s product consented to Google’s data collection
practices, the issue of consent—assuming a plaintiff class is
certified—is remanded to the district court for trial.

                   ______________________

     Before REYNA, HUGHES, and STOLL, Circuit Judges.
     Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge STOLL.
 Opinion dissenting in part filed by Circuit Judge HUGHES.
 STOLL, Circuit Judge.
     Sholem Weisner appeals from the district court’s dis-
 missal of his patent infringement suit under Federal Rule
 of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court held all of the
 asserted claims ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101. We af-
 firm-in-part and reverse-in-part.
                         BACKGROUND
                               I
     Mr. Weisner—a named inventor of U.S. Patent Nos.
 10,380,202, 10,642,910, 10,394,905 and 10,642,911—sued
 Google LLC for patent infringement in the United States
 District Court for the Southern District of New York.
     The four asserted patents are related and share a com-
 mon specification. 1 The shared specification generally de-
 scribes ways to “digitally record a person’s physical
 activities” and ways to use this digital record. ’202 patent,
 Abstract. Specifically, it describes a way in which individ-
 uals and businesses can sign up for a system so that they
 can exchange information, for instance “a URL or an elec-
 tronic business card.” Id. at col. 3 ll. 30–36. Then, as indi-
 viduals go about their day, they may encounter people or
 businesses that they want recorded in their “leg history,”
 which records the URLs or business cards along with the
 time and place of the encounters. Id. at col. 3 l. 48–col. 4


     1   Because the specifications are identical, we refer
 only to the ’202 patent specification unless otherwise spec-
 ified.

 l. 23; see also id. at Fig. 8. The specification describes a “leg
 history” as “the accumulation of a digital record of a per-
 son’s physical presence across time.” Id. at col. 1 ll. 6–10.
      Individuals record entries in their travel history either
 by accepting a proposal from another person/business (e.g.,
 by “push[ing] a button”), or by unilaterally making an en-
 try (e.g., by “tak[ing] a snapshot with a digital camera . . .
 and upload[ing] it to [their] databank”). Id. at col. 3
 l. 48–col. 4 l. 11. These methods are illustrated in Figure 3
 (showing a user accepting a proposed entry by “Macy’s”)
 and Figure 4 (showing a user unilaterally making an entry
 at “Benson’s” by taking a photograph):

 Id. at Figs. 3–4; see also id. at col. 11 l. 20–col. 13 l. 18.
      The specification also describes using this collected
 travel history data to “enhance web searching results.” Id. at col. 17 ll. 9–13. For example, the specification describes
 a method for enhancing search results by using a “useful
 person”—someone that has visited a location in common
 with the searching person. Id. at col. 17 l. 53–col. 18 l. 35;
 see also id. at col. 19 l. 27–col. 20 l. 61. As illustrated in
 Figure 9, in response to a person’s search, the system cross-
 references the digital histories of the searching person and
 the useful person to establish a common visit (e.g.,
 “www.fourseasons.com” in Figure 9) and then gives prior-
 ity to those search results that are found in the useful per-
 son’s travel history (e.g., “www.vegassteakhouse.com” in
 Figure 9):

 Id. at Fig. 9.
      Although the patents share a common specification,
 the claims are meaningfully different in their focus. Inde-
 pendent claim 1 of the ’202 patent recites recording “phys-
 ical location histories” of “individual member[s]” that visit
 “stationary vendor member[s]” in a “member network.” Id. at col. 21 ll. 13–67 (claim 1). In claim 1, the “physical en-
 counter” entry is proposed by the stationary vendor “auto-
 matic[ally]” and is recorded “upon acceptance by the

 handheld mobile communication device of the individual
 member.” Id. An example of such a system is shown in
 Figure 3, above.
     Claim 1 also recites a variety of other generic hardware
 and software components and features, such as a “telecom-
 munications network,” “database,” “application,” “position-
 ing system,” “handheld mobile communication device,”
 “URL,” a “searchable” “physical encounter history,” and a
 “visual timeline.” Id. The full claim is lengthy:
     1. A method of creating and/or using physical loca-
        tion histories, comprising:
       maintaining a processing system that is con-
        nected to a telecommunications network and
        configured to provide an account to an individ-
        ual member and to a stationary vendor mem-
        ber of a member network;
       providing an application that configures a
         handheld mobile communication device of
         each individual member of a member network
         to, upon instances of a physical encounter be-
         tween the individual member and the station-
         ary vendor member of a plurality of stationary
         vendor members of the member network at a
         physical premises of the stationary vendor
         member, a location of the physical encounter
         determined by a positioning system in com-
         munication with either the handheld mobile
         communication device or a communication de-
         vice of the stationary vendor member, and
         upon acceptance by the handheld mobile com-
         munication device of the individual member of
         an automatic proposal from the stationary
         vendor member, transmit a URL of the sta-
         tionary vendor member and a URL of the in-
         dividual member to the processing system
         automatically, thereby generating a location

           history entry, in at least the account of the in-
           dividual member, that includes (i) the URL of,
           and a location of, the stationary vendor mem-
           ber, (ii) a time and date of the physical en-
           counter, and (iii) an identity or the account of
           the individual member and of the stationary
           vendor member,
       the URL of the individual member associated
         with the individual member before the physi-
         cal encounter between the individual member
         and the stationary vendor member;
       the application maintaining a viewable physical
         encounter history on the handheld mobile
         communication device that includes URLs
         from multiple stationary vendor members and
         is searchable from the handheld mobile com-
         munication device (i) by URL of the individual
         member and of the stationary vendor mem-
         ber, (ii) by geographic location, and (iii) by
         time of the physical encounter,
       maintaining, using the processing system, a da-
        tabase of physical encounter histories of mem-
        bers of the member network whose accounts
        received the location history entry that was
        generated during the physical encounters, the
        individual member’s account having data
        transfer privileges that allow the physical en-
        counter history to be accumulated through
        transmission of location history entries from
        multiple handheld mobile communication de-
        vices of the individual member over time; and
       wherein the physical encounter history of a par-
         ticular individual member includes at least
         one visual timeline of physical encounters of
         the particular individual member.

 Id. at col. 21 ll. 13–67.
      Claim 1 of the ’910 patent is similar. It, too, describes
 “accumulation of physical location histories.” ’910 patent
 col. 21 ll. 16–61. It likewise recites generic features such
 as an “application,” “handheld mobile communication de-
 vice,” “database,” etc. Id. The ’910 patent’s recited method,
 however, involves “capture by the particular individual
 member” that is processed “automatically.” Id. In other
 words, the location history is recorded based on the initia-
 tive of the individual choosing to record entries, rather
 than in response to an individual “accept[ing]” an auto-
 matic proposition by a vendor as in claim 1 of the ’202 pa-
 tent. See id.      The representative claims of the remaining two pa-
 tents have a different focus: using physical location histo-
 ries to improve computerized search results. For instance,
 the preamble of claim 1 of the ’911 patent recites “enhanc-
 ing digital search results . . . using URLs of location histo-
 ries.” ’911 patent col. 21 ll. 14–53 (claim 1). The preamble
 to claim 1 of the ’905 patent likewise recites “combining en-
 hanced computerized searching . . . with use of humans as
 physical encounter links.” ’905 patent col. 21 ll. 15–63
 (claim 1). The claims then recite a number of steps for ac-
 cumulating physical location histories (similar to the ’202
 and ’911 patents) but then also include steps related to
 computerized searches using these histories. Because we
 will discuss claim 1 of both the ’911 and ’905 patents in the
 analysis below, we repeat the claim language in full here:
     1. A computer-implemented method of enhancing
        digital search results for a business in a target
        geographic area using URLs of location histo-
        ries, comprising:
        providing, by at least one processing system in
          communication with a positioning system, an
          account to (i) an individual member and (ii) a
          stationary vendor member, of a member

           the individual member’s account associated
           with a mobile communication device or multi-
           ple mobile communication devices,
       maintaining a communication link between the
        mobile communication device and the at least
        one processing system or the positioning sys-
        tem such that the mobile communication de-
        vice is configured to accumulate a location
        history on a database maintained by the at
        least one processing system from physical en-
        counters by the individual member at multi-
        ple stationary vendor members upon the
        mobile communication device being set to en-
        ter instances of a physical encounter between
        the individual member carrying the mobile
        communication device and the stationary ven-
        dor member at a physical premises of the sta-
        tionary vendor member, the positioning
        system determining a location of the individ-
        ual member at the physical premises;
       for each individual member having a location
          history who sends a search query to a search
          engine of the at least one processing system,

           (1) searching, by the search engine, the data-
           base for URLs of stationary vendor members
           in the location history, the location history
           also identifying time and geographic place of
           the physical encounters therein, and
           (2) assigning a priority, by the at least one
           processing system, in a search result ranking
           based on an appearance of one of the station-
           ary vendor member URLs in the location his-

          member of a plurality of stationary vendor
          members of the member network at a physical
          premises of the stationary vendor member, to
          transmit key data of the stationary vendor

     Mr. Weisner filed suit on April 6, 2020, in the Southern
 District of New York. At first, Mr. Weisner alleged in-
 fringement of only the ’202 patent. J.A. 3023–31 (Com-
 plaint). But he voluntarily amended his complaint on

 complaint—to add allegations of infringement of the other
 three patents. J.A. 3032–61 (First Amended Complaint).
     Google moved to dismiss Mr. Weisner’s First Amended
 Complaint on two alternative bases. First, Google argued
 that the asserted patent claims are ineligible under
 35 U.S.C. § 101. Second, Google argued that Mr. Weisner
 had failed to meet the minimum threshold for plausibly
 pleading his claim of patent infringement under Bell Atlan-
 tic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v.
 Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). The district court granted dis-
 missal on the Twombly / Iqbal basis on January 4, 2021.
 J.A. 12–14. It then held a hearing the next day to discuss
 patent eligibility. J.A. 2001–25 (Hr’g Tr.). After the hear-
 ing, the district court also granted dismissal based on inel-
 igibility under § 101 in a short, one-paragraph order.
 J.A. 15. In that same order, the district court provided
 Mr. Weisner an opportunity to file an amended complaint.
 Id.
     Mr. Weisner filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC),
 adding allegations of infringement and allegations related
 to patent eligibility. J.A. 2026–55. Relevant to this appeal,
 Mr. Weisner added a section entitled “Invention Back-
 ground and System Details Explained.” J.A. 2028–33 (SAC
 ¶¶ 11–30). Google again moved to dismiss the SAC based
 on both § 101 and Twombly / Iqbal. The district court
 granted dismissal based on § 101 without another hearing.

 citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; and then citing Johnson
 v. Priceline.com, Inc., 711 F.3d 271, 275 (2d Cir. 2013)).
      Patent eligibility under § 101 is a question of law that
 may involve underlying questions of fact. Interval Licens-
 ing LLC v. AOL, Inc., 896 F.3d 1335, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2018)
 (citing Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018)). We review a district court’s ultimate con-
 clusion on patent eligibility de novo. Id. We have held that
 “[p]atent eligibility can be determined on the pleadings . . .
 when there are no factual allegations that, when taken as
 true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter
 of law.” Data Engine Techs. LLC v. Google LLC, 
906F.3d 999, 1007 (Fed. Cir. 2018).
      Section 101 defines patent-eligible subject matter as
 “any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or
 composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
 thereof.” 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Supreme Court established
 a two-step test for examining patent eligibility under § 101
 in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. 208 (2014). Under step one, we “determine whether the claims
 at issue are directed to . . . [a] patent-ineligible concept[,]”
 such as an abstract idea. Id. at 217 (quoting Mayo Collab-
 orative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab’ys, Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 77–
 79 (2012)). Under step two, we “consider the elements of
 each claim both individually and ‘as an ordered combina-
 tion’ to determine whether the additional elements ‘trans-
 form the nature of the claim’ into a patent-eligible
 application.” Id. Step two is “a search for an ‘inventive
 concept’—i.e., an element or combination of elements that
 is ‘sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts
 to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible

 concept] itself.’” Id. at 217–18 (alteration in original) (quot-
 ing Mayo, 566 U.S. at 72).
                                I
     We start with the ’202 and ’910 patents. We determine
 the challenged claims of these patents are patent ineligible,
 and thus we affirm the district court’s dismissal as to the
 claims of these two patents.
                                A
     At step one of Alice, we agree with the district court
 that the representative claims2 of these patents are di-
 rected to an abstract idea. The district court correctly de-
 termined that the patent claims are directed to “collect[ing]
 information on a user’s movements and location history
 [and] electronically record[ing] that data.” Weisner, 551
 F. Supp. 3d at 339. Put more simply, the claims are di-
 rected to creating a digital travel log.
     The claim language supports our conclusion that the
 claims are directed to creating a digital travel log. For in-
 stance, the preamble of claim 1 of the ’202 patent recites
 “creating and/or using physical location histories.” ’202 pa-
 tent col. 21 ll. 13–14. The steps in the body of the claim
 describe a generic process for achieving the goal of creating


      2  Although Mr. Weisner argues on appeal that a
 number of claims are “exemplary,” Appellant’s Br. 20, 28,
 32, 37, he only describes and analyzes claim 1 of each pa-
 tent in any significant detail. Accordingly, we treat claim
 1 of each patent as representative.
     Mr. Weisner briefly mentions claim 3 of the ’202 patent
 in two short paragraphs of his opening brief. Appellant’s
 Br. 57, 59; see also Appellant’s Reply Br. 26. To the extent
 that this was sufficient to preserve his argument, we also
 determine that claim 3 is ineligible for the reasons de-
 scribed below. See infra at 25 n.4.
Case: 21-2228    Document: 62      Page: 15     Filed: 10/13/2022




 WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC                                     15



 a digital travel log, such as “maintaining a processing sys-
 tem” and using an “application” to generate a user’s “loca-
 tion history entry” on their “handheld mobile
 communication device.” Id. at col. 23 ll. 15–67. The pre-
 amble to claim 1 of the ’910 patent likewise recites a
 “method for accumulation of physical location histories.”
 ’910 patent col. 21 ll. 16–19. And again, the body of the
 claim recites generic features like a “processing system
 that is connected to a telecommunications network,” a
 “URL,” and a “handheld mobile communication device.” Id.
 at col. 21 ll. 20–61.
      Mr. Weisner does little to combat the district court’s ar-
 ticulation of what the claims are directed to for these two
 particular patents. Indeed, Mr. Weisner’s opening brief
 states that “[t]he method of claim 1 of the ’202 patent is
 directed to the creation and use of physical location histo-
 ries.” Appellant’s Br. 37. Likewise, Mr. Weisner’s own al-
 legations in the SAC of what the patents are “generally
 directed to” also support our conclusion that the claims are
 directed to creating a digital travel log. For instance,
 Mr. Weisner states that “[t]he ’202 Patent is generally di-
 rected to a method and system of creating and/or using
 physical location histories.” J.A. 2035–36 (SAC ¶ 34). Sim-
 ilarly, for the ’910 patent, Mr. Weisner alleges that patent
 “is generally directed to a method, system and computer-
 readable medium for accumulating physical location histo-
 ries based on digital member entries using a URL or an
 identifier associated with a URL.” J.A. 2044 (SAC ¶ 52).
      Both the Supreme Court and this court’s precedent
 suggest that claims purporting to improve “the functioning
 of the computer itself” or “an existing technological pro-
 cess” might not be directed to an abstract idea. Alice, 573
 U.S. at 225; Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 
822 F.3d 1327,1335 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Based on this precedent, Mr. Weis-
 ner asserts that claim 1 is not abstract, but rather “im-
 proves the functionality of the underlying system” by
 “[1] automatically recording physical interactions and

 [2] limiting what is recorded to only specific types of inter-
 actions that are pre-approved and agreed to by an individ-
 ual member and a vendor member.” See, e.g., Appellant’s
 Br. 57. As the district court correctly observed, however,
 “[h]umans have consistently kept records of a person’s lo-
 cation and travel in the form of travel logs, diaries, jour-
 nals, and calendars, which compile information such as
 time and location.” Weisner, 551 F. Supp. 3d at 339. Auto-
 mation or digitization of a conventional method of organiz-
 ing human activity like the creation of a travel log on a
 computer does not bring the claims out of the realm of ab-
 stractness. See Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Westlake Servs.,
 859 F.3d 1044, 1055 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (“[M]ere automation
 of manual processes using generic computers does not con-
 stitute a patentable improvement in computer technol-
 ogy.”); Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells
 Fargo Bank, Nat’l Ass’n, 776 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir.
 2014) (“The concept of data collection, recognition, and
 storage is undisputedly well-known.”).
     Likewise, the fact that the claims recite a number of
 generic elements—including a processing system, an appli-
 cation, and a handheld mobile communication device—
 does not shift their focus away from the core idea of creat-
 ing a digital travel log. “[S]imply appending conventional
 steps, specified at a high level of generality, to . . . abstract
 ideas cannot make those . . . ideas patentable.” Mayo, 
566U.S. at 82; see also Affinity Labs of Tex., LLC v. Ama-
 zon.com Inc., 838 F.3d 1266, 1272 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (“The
 addition of basic user customization features to the inter-
 face does not alter the abstract nature of the claims . . . .”).
     Finally, Mr. Weisner’s last counterpoint—that the
 claims are not abstract because they are directed to only
 capturing the travel history of “members”—is not persua-
 sive. Appellant’s Br. 56–58. According to Mr. Weisner, this
 improves the “integrity” of the data and avoids an “inunda-
 tion of information making it useless.” Id. at 56–58. But
 these purported technological advantages are nothing

 WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC                                    17



 more than attorney argument, unlinked to the complaint
 or the patent claims or specification. Indeed, neither the
 specification nor the SAC addresses this purported techno-
 logical improvement. Although the claims do recite a
 “member of the member network” and other “member” lim-
 itations, they do not limit the data collection to only mem-
 bers. ’202 patent col. 21 ll. 13–67; ’910 patent col. 21
 ll. 16–61. Thus, the purported benefit of limiting data ac-
 cumulation to members is not captured in the claims and,
 accordingly, does not shift the focus of the claims away
 from the abstract idea of creating a digital travel log.
     Accordingly, we agree with the district court’s analysis
 at step one for these claims and reject Mr. Weisner’s argu-
 ments to the contrary. Having concluded that the repre-
 sentative claims for the ’202 and ’910 patents are directed
 to an abstract idea, we proceed to step two.
                               B
      Turning to step two, we consider the elements of each
 claim both individually and “as an ordered combination” to
 determine whether the claims recite “something more”
 than the abstract idea to transform the nature of the claim
 into a patent-eligible application. See Alice, 573 U.S. at 217
 (quoting Mayo, 566 U.S. at 77–80). We conclude that the
 district court appropriately relied on statements in the
 specification and concessions by the patentee to conclude
 that the claims “rely on the use of existing technology to
 create a computerized version of [travel] logs and do not
 ‘focus on a specific means or method that improves the rel-
 evant technology.’” Weisner, 551 F. Supp. 3d at 340 (quot-
 ing Apple, Inc. v. Ameranth, Inc., 842 F.3d 1229, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2016)).
     As the district court appropriately determined, the
 specification describes the components and features listed
 in the claims generically, supporting the conclusion that
 these components and features are conventional, not in-
 ventive concepts in the patents. See ’202 patent col. 8

 ll. 32–42 (describing the “software 89” for implementing
 the invention on a mobile device as being “content [that] is
 known to those skilled in the art of computer science” and
 which “can be readily developed or is already known to
 those skilled in the art”), col. 8 ll. 38–40 (describing meth-
 ods to “receive and transmit wirelessly” including “methods
 such as Bluetooth®”), col. 8 ll. 43–60 (explaining that
 “handheld electronic network device 22” includes “any
 other handheld electronic device that is typically carried
 around by people during their day including IPods, cellular
 telephones, [etc.]”), col. 8 ll. 61–64 (generically describing
 having a customer “sign up at a web site” to become “a
 member of the network”), col. 11 ll. 44–46 (explaining that
 the “telecommunications network” is typically “a global
 network such as the world wide web”), col 15 ll. 44–50 (ref-
 erencing a generic “GPS or other navigational system” to
 create a “geographical place stamp”). We agree with the
 district court that these claims do not recite significantly
 more than the abstract idea of digitizing a travel log using
 conventional components.
     Mr. Weisner again argues that the claim limitations di-
 rected to “members” provide the something more to trans-
 form the claims into a patent-eligible invention.
 Appellant’s Br. 54–55, 58–59; Appellant’s Reply Br. 22–24.
 As explained above, however, this argument is not linked
 to the claims.
     For these reasons, we agree with the district court’s
 conclusion that the asserted claims of the ’202 and ’910 pa-
 tents are ineligible under § 101, and therefore affirm the
 district court’s dismissal as to these claims.
                               II
     We turn next to the ’905 and ’911 patents. We deter-
 mine the challenged claims of these patents have not been
 shown to be ineligible at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, where the
 court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as
 true and must construe all reasonable inferences in favor

 of Mr. Weisner. Thus, we reverse the district court’s dis-
 missal as to the claims of these two patents.
                               A
     At step one, the district court erred by failing to sepa-
 rately analyze these patents. Although the specifications
 in all four patents are the same, the claims of the ’905 and
 ’911 patents are not directed to the same subject matter as
 the ’202 and ’910 patents. Rather, at step one, we conclude
 that the representative claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents
 are directed to creating and using travel histories to im-
 prove computerized search results.
      The claim language supports this focus. In contrast
 with the preambles of claim 1 of both the ’202 and ’910 pa-
 tents, which focus on creating the location histories, the
 preamble to claim 1 of the ’911 patent recites a “method of
 enhancing digital search results for a business in a target
 geographic area using URLs of location histories.” ’911 pa-
 tent col. 21 ll. 14–16. Similarly, the preamble to claim 1 of
 the ’905 patent recites a “method of combining enhanced
 computerized searching for a target business with use of
 humans as physical encounter links.” ’905 patent col. 21
 ll. 15–17. The bodies of the ’905 and ’911 patent claims also
 support this emphasis. They first describe accumulation of
 physical location histories in a highly generic fashion, and
 then, in more detail, describe the use of the location histo-
 ries in digital searches. ’905 patent col. 21 ll. 18–37 (first
 half of claim 1 describing generating a database of physical
 location histories), col. 21 ll. 38–63 (second half describing
 using the physical location histories in response to a
 “search query”); ’911 patent col. 21 ll. 17–37 (first half of
 claim 1 describing “accumulat[ing] a location history on a
 database”); col. 21 ll. 38–53 (second half describing using
 that information in a “search query”).
     The specification also supports this emphasis on using
 location histories in computerized searching as a distinct
 concept from mere accumulation of location histories. For
Case: 21-2228    Document: 62      Page: 20    Filed: 10/13/2022

 instance, the background of the invention lists certain as-
 pects of searching on the world wide web as “[a]nother
 problem” that the patent is directed to solving. ’905 patent
 col. 2 ll. 47–62. Similarly, the “Summary of the Present In-
 vention” emphasizes an “improved method of searching the
 world wide web . . . that makes use of digital histories.” Id.
 at col. 4 ll. 36–38. Finally, the detailed description of the
 invention includes a section describing “Using Digital His-
 tories to Improve Search Results.” Id. at col. 17 l. 8–col. 20
 l. 67.
     Our conclusion is again supported by allegations in
 Mr. Weisner’s SAC regarding what the ’911 and ’905 pa-
 tents are “generally directed to.” See J.A. 2041 (SAC ¶ 46)
 (“The ’911 Patent is generally directed to a method and sys-
 tem of enhancing digital search results for a business in a
 target geographic area using URLs of location histo-
 ries . . . .”); J.A. 2038–39 (SAC ¶ 40) (“The ’905 Patent is
 generally directed to a method and system of combining en-
 hanced computerized searching for a target business with
 use of physical encounters between individuals having
 communications devices and vendors . . . .”).
     Whether these claims are directed to an abstract idea
 presents a much closer question than the claims in the ’202
 and ’910 patents. We ultimately conclude that the repre-
 sentative claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents are directed
 to an abstract idea, but that, on the pleadings, they satisfy
 step two of the Alice test. Thus, we proceed to step two.
                               B
     Turning to step two of Alice, we conclude that
 Mr. Weisner has plausibly alleged that the ’905 and ’911
 patent claims recite a specific implementation of the ab-
 stract idea that purports to solve a problem unique to the
 Internet and that, accordingly, these claims should not
 have been held ineligible under step two at this stage.

 WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC                                     21



     The district court rejected the claims at step two be-
 cause the “patents at issue . . . confirm that the patented
 search and data collection uses conventional techniques
 without an inventive concept.” Weisner, 551 F. Supp. 3d
 at 340. In particular, the court relied on statements from
 the SAC and specification that concede the patentee did not
 invent a new search engine algorithm. J.A. 2030 (SAC
 ¶ 18) (conceding the patented system “uses the same or
 similar algorithm used by existing search engines”); ’905
 patent col. 17 ll. 13–15. Although this means the search
 engine algorithm cannot be the inventive concept that
 saves the claims at step two, this does not doom these
 claims. As explained below, we conclude that the claims’
 specificity as to the mechanism through which they achieve
 improved search results (through a “location relationship”
 with a “reference individual” for the ’905 patent or through
 the “location history of the individual member” who is run-
 ning the search in a targeted “geographic area” for the ’911
 patent) is sufficient. Stated another way, disclosing a new
 search engine algorithm is not necessary as these claims do
 not per se concern searching for new information, but ra-
 ther concern a new technique for prioritizing the results of
 the conventional search. 3
    Claim 1 of the ’905 patent plausibly captures an in-
 ventive concept in the form of a specific technique for using



     3   The dissent also echoes this same paragraph of the
 SAC and lines from the specification regarding the search
 algorithm. Dissent at 3. Like the district court’s opinion,
 this misses the point. It is not the algorithm itself that is
 alleged to be unconventional in the SAC. Rather, the SAC
 and the patent specification allege that it is the specific im-
 plementations for using the travel histories to prioritize the
 order of the search results that operate differently than
 conventional methods and solve an internet-centric prob-
 lem, as further described below.
Case: 21-2228    Document: 62      Page: 22     Filed: 10/13/2022




 22                                     WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC



 physical location history data to improve computerized
 search results. In particular, claim 1 uses a “physical loca-
 tion relationship” with a third-party “reference individual”
 to increase the priority of search results. Claim 1 describes
 how the physical relationship is established—the system
 searches the physical location histories of both a reference
 individual and the searching person to determine whether
 they have visited a common location (“second stationary
 vendor member”). ’905 patent col. 21 ll. 46–56. The system
 then prioritizes search results that the reference individual
 has visited. Id. at col. 21 ll. 46–48, 61–63 (stating “the ref-
 erence individual . . . has a physical location relationship
 with the first stationary vendor member” and “increas[ing]
 a ranking of the first stationary vendor member”).
     This is more than just the concept of improving a web
 search using location history—it is a specific implementa-
 tion of that concept. Even Google recognizes the specificity
 in this process with the following diagram from its appeal
 brief “illustrat[ing] the relationships”:




 Appellee’s Br. 12.
     This specific implementation is also alleged to solve a
 problem particular to the Internet. The SAC emphasizes
 this particular aspect as “something significantly more,”
 explaining that “when a user will search for a physical lo-
 cation to visit, the inventive system will search a list of the
 physical location URLs and produce a result, based

 on: past visit of such user, and past visits of location rela-
 tives of such user.” J.A. 2031 (SAC ¶ 21). The SAC ex-
 plains this feature provides “specifically tailored result[s]
 to the searcher’s unique characteristics” and “eliminates
 the inherent bias of pushing and referring places through
 conventional web searches.” J.A. 2031–32 (SAC ¶¶ 22–23).
 The SAC explains that this is different from the conven-
 tional method, in which web searches merely defaulted to
 the “highest-ranking Uniform Resource Locator (‘URL’)
 link” by using purely “virtual encounters.” J.A. 2029 (SAC
 ¶¶ 15–16).
     Looking to the intrinsic record, the specification also
 emphasizes that conventional web searches have a problem
 of returning voluminous, generic, non-personalized search
 results. For example, the specification states that the cur-
 rent “process of searching the world wide web does not ad-
 equately take cognizance of the unique characteristics and
 tastes of the searching person.” ’905 patent col. 2 ll. 57–60.
 The solution, according to the specification, is an “improved
 method of searching the world wide web . . . that makes use
 of digital histories.” Id. at col. 4 ll. 36–38. That portion of
 the specification specifically calls out the method of using
 a “useful person” which operates the same as the “reference
 individual” of the claims. Id. at col. 4 ll. 43–55. The speci-
 fication describes this “useful person” mechanism in signif-
 icant detail. Id. at col. 17 l. 53–col. 20 l. 67. Accepting
 these factual allegations in the SAC and specification as
 true, together with all reasonable inferences, as we must
 at this stage, see Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Soft-
 ware, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1127–30 (Fed. Cir. 2018); see also
 Johnson, 711 F.3d at 275, we conclude that the claims of
 the ’905 patent include an inventive concept that suffices
 to defeat Google’s motion to dismiss.
     Claim 1 of the ’911 patent is similar, although it pre-
 sents a different solution to the problem of generic web
 search results. Claim 1 of the ’911 patent is particular to
 “search quer[ies] targeting a geographic area.” ’911 patent

 24                                    WEISNER   v. GOOGLE LLC



 col. 21 ll. 38–41. The claim recites searching the location
 history database for entries “in the location history of the
 individual member” conducting the geographically tar-
 geted search that fall within “the target geographic area.”
 Id. at col. 21 ll. 42–53. As described above, this implemen-
 tation is alleged in the SAC to be an inventive concept that
 improves computerized search results by taking into ac-
 count the “past visit of such user” (i.e., the particular user
 conducting the search) and “geographic location” of the
 search. J.A. 2031 (SAC ¶ 21). This is contrasted against
 the conventional method of prioritizing searches based ex-
 clusively on “virtual encounters.”           J.A. 2029 (SAC
 ¶¶ 15–16). And the claimed solution addresses the prob-
 lem of non-personalized search results described in the
 specification. ’911 patent col. 2 l. 64–col. 3 l. 2. Thus, we
 conclude that the claims of the ’911 patent also include an
 inventive concept that precludes an ineligibility determi-
 nation at the pleadings stage.
     We have previously held patent claims eligible at step
 two when they provided a specific solution to an Internet-
 centric problem. For example, the claims in DDR Hold-
 ings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2014), disclosed a system in which a visitor to a
 webpage that clicked on an advertisement on that webpage
 would not be transported to the third-party advertiser’s
 page but instead would remain within the original host’s
 webpage, allowing the host to retain web traffic. Id. at 1257–58. We explained that this provided “an inventive
 concept for resolving this particular Internet-centric prob-
 lem, rendering the claims patent-eligible.” Id. at 1259.
 And we noted that, unlike other patent claims that a pa-
 tentee argued were eligible based on an “Internet-centric
 challenge,” but that were held ineligible in Ultramercial,
 Inc. v. Hulu, LLC, 772 F.3d 709 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the
 “claims at issue [in DDR] specify how interactions with the
 Internet are manipulated to yield a desired result—a result
 that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of

 events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink.”
 DDR, 773 F.3d at 1258.
     The ’905 and ’911 patent claims are analogous to those
 we held eligible in DDR. Here, the record supports that the
 claims plausibly provide a solution to an Internet-centric
 problem regarding web searches, allowing for more person-
 alized search results than conventional methods. And like
 the claims in DDR, the claims here avoid the Ultramercial
 problem of “broadly and generically claim[ing] ‘use of the
 Internet’ to perform an abstract business practice (with in-
 significant added activity)” because they provide a “specific
 way” to solve the problem—through the “reference individ-
 ual.” Id. at 1258–59.
     Thus, we conclude that claim 1 of the ’905 patent and
 claim 1 of the ’911 patent plausibly recite inventive con-
 cepts that add significantly more to the abstract idea of us-
 ing travel histories to improve computerized search
 results. These inventive concepts are supported by allega-
 tions in the SAC as well as portions of the specification,
 which we must accept as true at the pleadings stage. See
 Aatrix, 882 F.3d at 1127–30; see also Johnson, 
711 F.3dat 275. 4



     4   Like claim 1 of both the ’905 and ’911 patents,
 claim 3 of the ’202 patent (mentioned only in passing in
 Mr. Weisner’s brief) is directed to the idea of creating and
 using travel histories to improve computerized search re-
 sults. Unlike the ’905 and ’911 patent claims, however,
 claim 3 of the ’202 patent fails to provide a “specific way”
 to solve the internet-centric problem regarding computer-
 ized search results. Instead, it recites the raw idea of using
 travel histories in a search. Claim 3 broadly describes
 “searching [] the physical encounter histories of the [loca-
 tion history] database” and “using results of the searching

                         CONCLUSION
     The district court correctly concluded that the claims
 in the ’202 and ’910 patents are ineligible under 35 U.S.C.
§ 101. Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal
 as to those patents.
     The ’905 and ’911 patent claims, in contrast, plausibly
 include more than merely the concept of improving com-
 puterized search results using travel histories. Instead,
 those claims add significantly more to that abstract idea by
 implementing a specific solution to a problem rooted in
 computer technology. Accordingly, we reverse the district
 court’s dismissal as to the claims of the ’905 and ’911 pa-
 tents.

 patent col. 22 ll. 4–7 (claim 3). It does not include any spec-
 ificity as to whose histories are being used or how they are
 being used to affect the search ranking, nor does it provide
 any mechanisms for limiting the relevant histories. It thus
 recites nothing more than the abstract idea. Accordingly,
 we determine that claim 3 of the ’202 patent is ineligible.

 HUGHES, Circuit Judge, dissenting-in-part.
      I agree with the majority that the claims of the ’202 and
 ’910 patents are ineligible. I further agree that the claims
 of the ’905 and ’911 patents are directed to the abstract idea
 of “creating and using travel histories to improve comput-
 erized search results.” I dissent-in-part because I disagree
 with Part II.B of the majority’s analysis, determining that
 the claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents recite inventive con-
 cepts. Because the second amended complaint admits that
 the algorithms used to incorporate location data are rou-
 tine and conventional, and because the claims do not solve

 a problem specific to the internet, I would affirm the dis-
 trict court’s determination that the claims of these two pa-
 tents are ineligible.
                               I
     The second amended complaint and specifications re-
 veal that the claimed methods of the ’905 and ’911 incorpo-
 rate location history into a search engine algorithm in a
 routine and conventional way: using well-understood
 methods of incorporating browsing history. Thus, all the
 claims add is the idea of using location history in a search
 engine algorithm, which is the abstract idea itself.
     At step two, we distinguish between “laws of nature,
 natural phenomena, and abstract ideas”—which are not
 themselves patentable subject matter—and inventive ap-
 plications of the abstract idea—which might be eligible.
 Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab’ys, Inc., 
566U.S. 66, 70–71 (“[A]n application of a law of nature or
 mathematical formula to a known structure or process may
 well be deserving of patent protection.” (quoting Diamond
 v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 187 (1981)). We make this distinc-
 tion by examining “the elements of the claim to determine
 whether it contains an ‘inventive concept’ sufficient to
 ‘transform’ the claimed abstract idea into a patent-eligible
 application.” Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Soft-
 ware, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1128 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting
 Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 573 U.S. 208, 221
 (2014)). “If the elements involve ‘well-understood, routine,
 [and] conventional activity previously engaged in by re-
 searchers in the field,’ they do not constitute an ‘inventive
 concept.’” Id. at 1128 (alteration in original) (quoting Mayo,
 566 U.S. at 73).
     The question of inventiveness at step two can involve
 underlying issues of fact, Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 
881 F.3d1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018), and we take the facts alleged
 in the complaint as true when considering step two on a
 motion to dismiss.

     Mr. Weisner’s second amended compliant explains
 that, “[p]rior to 2007, . . . [e]xisting search engine and
 search algorithm technology used records of virtual en-
 counters only.” Appx2029 at ¶ 15. Rather than “discern the
 most relevant physical location,” these search engines re-
 turned websites based on, among other things “the individ-
 ual’s cyber activity [and] surf history.” Appx2029 at ¶ 16.
     The claims of the ’905 and ’911 patents detail ways in
 which a search engine can use a person’s history of physical
 encounters to provide relevant search results. In the
 ’905 patent, the search engine uses location histories of
 both the “searching” person and a second “reference” per-
 son who has visited at least one of the same locations. ’905
 patent at 21:50–63. The search engine prioritizes search
 results appearing in the reference person’s location history.
 Id. at 21:46–49. In the ’911 patent, the search engine pri-
 oritizes results within the geographic area of the searching
 person’s other physical encounters. ’911 patent at 21:39–
 53.
     The second amended complaint concedes, though, that
 the claimed method “uses the same or similar algorithm
 used by existing search engines, only with physical encoun-
 ters that are now searchable online just as cyber encoun-
 ters were until now.” Appx2030 at ¶ 18. In other words, the
 claimed methods of using location history are conventional
 methods, merely reused or adapted for use with a new type
 of data—location history. This allegation accords with the
 specification, which states that “[a]lgorithms can be easily
 imagined by those skilled in the art of search engine algo-
 rithms that would improve searching.” ’905 patent
 at 17:13–15. Like search engines considered browsing his-
 tory before 2007, the claimed “search engine algorithm
 would consider the URLs in the [location] history of the
 person doing the searching.” Id. at 17:18–19.
     Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, the
 claimed methods of incorporating location data are “well-

 understood, routine, [and] conventional.” Mayo, 
566 U.S. at79 (alteration in original). The methods thus do not convert
 the abstract idea—creating and using travel histories to
 improve computerized search results—into an inventive
 application.
     Because the details of the methods are conventional,
 the only purportedly unconventional aspect of the claims is
 the use of location history in a search engine. See
 Appx2029–31 at ¶¶ 17–21 (emphasizing “obstacles” related
 to the collection of location history and the “benefits” of
 having a location history and using it for search, rather
 than any obstacles or benefits arising from the details of
 the search algorithm implementation). But using location
 history to improve search results is, as the majority con-
 cludes, the abstract idea itself. Maj. Op. 20–22. “It has been
 clear since Alice that a claimed invention’s use of the inel-
 igible concept to which it is directed cannot supply the in-
 ventive concept that renders the invention ‘significantly
 more’ than that ineligible concept.” BSG Tech LLC v.
 Buyseasons, Inc., 899 F.3d 1281, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2018).
 Thus, the ’905 and ’911 patents fail to claim an inventive
 concept adequate to save them at step two.
                               II
     DDR Holdings does not say otherwise. Although the
 claims here are limited to internet search engines, they do
 not solve an internet-specific problem.
     In DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, we upheld claims
 covering an “e-commerce outsourcing system.” 
773 F.3d1245, 1249, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2014). “On activation of a hy-
 perlink on a host website—such as an advertisement for a
 third-party merchant— . . . the system generates and di-
 rects the visitor to a composite web page that displays prod-
 uct information from the third-party merchant, but retains
 the host website’s ‘look and feel.’” Id. at 1248–49. This sys-
 tem solved the problem that “third-party merchants [could]
 ‘lure the [host website’s] visitor traffic away’ from the host

 website because visitors would be taken to the third-party
 merchant’s website when they clicked on the merchant’s
 advertisement on the host site.” Id. at 1248 (quoting U.S.
Patent No. 6,629,135 at 2:26–30) (second alteration in orig-
 inal).
     We upheld these claims at step two, distinguishing Al-
 ice and several other cases because the claims “do not
 merely recite the performance of some business practice
 known from the pre-Internet world along with the require-
 ment to perform it on the Internet.” Id. at 1257. Instead,
 “the claimed solution is necessarily rooted in computer
 technology in order to overcome a problem specifically aris-
 ing in the realm of computer networks.” Id.      The ’905 and ’911 patents purport to improve recom-
 mendations provided on the internet. See ’905 patent at
 2:47–62, 17:8; ’911 patent at 2:50–3:2. But the problem of
 overly generic recommendations predates the internet, as
 does the solution of using location information to improve
 recommendations. To get more personalized recommenda-
 tions from a travel agent, people could ask about specific
 destinations and list locations they have visited before,
 analogous to the method of the ’911 patent. To get more
 personalized restaurant recommendations, people could
 ask friends with similar tastes who have visited some of
 the same restaurants, like the ’905 patent. Cf. In re Green-
 stein, 778 F. App’x 935, 938–39 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (“[T]he
 problem of trustworthy recommendations predates the In-
 ternet” . . . “[and] is a business problem, not a technical
 one.”); Bridge & Post, Inc. v. Verizon Commc’ns, Inc., 778
F. App’x 882, 884 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (“The concept of tailoring
 advertisements based on user data . . . dates back at least
 to local radio and television advertisements, which played
 only for users located in specific cities and were published
 in-between otherwise national programs. In the computer
 context, prior art systems tracked users . . . . A user’s loca-
 tion could be approximately determined by the IP address
 of their device . . . .”). The sheer amount of non-local

 information available on the internet perhaps exacerbates
 the problem of overly generic recommendations, but this
 does not make it an internet-centric problem.
      By contrast, the claimed system in DDR “overc[a]me a
 problem specifically arising in the realm of computer net-
 works” that does not have the same close analogues in the
 physical world—one cannot be inadvertently lured away
 from a physical retail store with the press of a button. DDR,
 773 F.3d at 1257. Rather than solving a problem specifi-
 cally arising in the realm of computer networks, the
 claimed methods of the ’911 and ’905 patents “merely recite
 the performance of some business practice known from the
 pre-Internet world along with the requirement to perform
 it on the Internet.” Id.     I would find all challenged claims ineligible and re-
 spectfully dissent-in-part.","https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8248473/weisner-v-google-llc/?type=o&type=o&q=google&order_by=score+desc","{

Before: M. Margaret McKeown, Danielle J. Forrest, and Gabriel P. Sanchez,
Circuit Judges.

      Google LLC’s Motion for a Stay of Permanent Injunction Pending Google’s

Forthcoming Petitions for Rehearing and, if Necessary, Certiorari is denied. The

request for a stay pending a petition for rehearing is moot because the court issued

an administrative stay pending decision on the petition for rehearing and the court

denied that petition on September 12, 2025.

      The Permanent Injunction (“Injunction”) was issued on October 7, 2024.

This is not a situation in which Google must comply with key provisions of the

Injunction immediately upon issuance of the mandate. Rather, the district court

recognized that a lag time between the judgment and imposition of the key

provisions of the Injunction would be appropriate. To facilitate the spirit of that




                                         2                                   24-6274
ruling, on August 1, 2025, we stayed the Injunction pending appeal, despite the

district court’s denial of Google’s motion for a stay.

      For the key provisions that Google attacks—paragraphs 11 and 12 of the

Injunction related to “restor[ing] competition in the Android app-distribution

market with the catalog-access and app-store-distribution remedies,” Op. at 40—

Google has eight months from the issuance of the mandate to comply with the

Injunction. However, by this Order we modify the Injunction to extend the time

for compliance with paragraphs 11 and 12 to ten months following issuance of the

mandate. Also, per Google’s request in its initial Emergency Motion for Partial

Stay of the Permanent Injunction, we extend the short-term compliance deadlines,

contained in paragraphs 4-7 and 9-10 of the Injunction, until thirty days after the

issuance of the mandate. (The thirty-day compliance deadline contained in

paragraph 13 remains intact.)

      Under the terms of the Injunction, either party “may request a modification

of the injunction for good cause.” This provision continues to apply except with

respect to paragraphs 11 and 12; Epic may not request a compliance deadline

shorter than the ten-month deadline imposed by this Order. Google’s motion does

not encompass paragraph 8 of the Injunction; Google has represented that it

already made the contractual changes ordered with respect to carriers and phone

manufacturers. Imposition of the verdict has already been suspended more than



                                         3                                  24-6274
twenty months since the December 2023 jury verdict in favor of Epic and almost a

year since the Permanent Injunction. We also note that Google has represented

that it will file any petition for certiorari within forty-five days of a decision on its

stay motion.

      To obtain a stay of the mandate pending certiorari under Federal Rule of

Appellate Procedure 41(d), Google is required to show 1) “a reasonable probability

that four members of the Court would consider the underlying issue sufficiently

meritorious for the grant of certiorari[;]” 2) “a significant possibility of reversal of

the lower court’s decision;” and 3) “a likelihood that irreparable harm will result if

that decision is not stayed.” White v. Florida, 458 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1982). We

recognize that Google need not demonstrate “exceptional circumstances . . . to

justify a stay,” Bryant v. Ford Motor Co., 886 F.2d 1526, 1528 (9th Cir. 1989),

because it is “often the case” that our court issues a stay pending certiorari, United

States v. Pete, 525 F. 3d 844, 850 (9th Cir. 2008).

      Although we stayed the Injunction pending appeal, in our comprehensive

sixty-seven-page opinion, our unanimous panel upheld the jury’s finding of

antitrust liability and the district court’s Injunction. We emphasize that this Order

is issued after a jury trial and multitudinous district court proceedings. Unlike

many stay orders, this Order does not relate to a stay pending issuance of a

preliminary injunction but rather relates to a stay request following a jury trial, a



                                           4                                     24-6274
permanent injunction, and a final judgment. Following a fifteen-day jury trial with

forty-five witnesses in which the jury found Google violated federal and state

antitrust laws, the district court undertook additional testimony and hearings and

issued detailed findings with respect to the Injunction.

      Google’s primary contention on appeal focuses on factual disagreements

with the district court, an effort to shoehorn the results of the Epic v. Apple

litigation into this case, and a misapprehension of essential antitrust principles. As

for security concerns, we held that the Injunction “explicitly address these risks”

through adoption of reasonable measures “to ensure that the platforms or stores,

and the apps they offer, are safe from a computer systems and security standpoint.”

Op at 64–65. In addition, the Injunction provides for a Technical Committee to

assist in resolving technical disputes, including security concerns.

      In view of the rationale and details laid out in our opinion, we conclude that

Google has not met the requirements under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure

41(d) regarding a meritorious petition for certiorari or the significant possibility of

reversal. In addition, Google’s claim for irreparable harm is unfounded in light of

trial testimony. Finally, we are unpersuaded by Google’s claim that market

confusion, monetary expenditures, and national security support a claim of

irreparable harm.

    ARGUED SEPTEMBER 17, 2021 — DECIDED JULY 11, 2023
                ____________________

   Before SYKES, Chief Judge, and FLAUM and KIRSCH, Circuit
Judges.
    SYKES, Chief Judge. This class-action lawsuit arises from a
research collaboration between Google and the University of
Chicago together with its affiliated Medical Center. (We will
refer to the latter two as “the University” unless the context
2                                                   No. 20-3134

requires otherwise.) Harnessing the power of artificial
intelligence, the research partners aspired to develop soft-
ware capable of anticipating patients’ future healthcare
needs. If successful, the software promised to reduce medi-
cal complications, eliminate unnecessary hospital stays, and,
ultimately, improve patients’ healthcare outcomes.
    As an initial step in the research effort, the University de-
livered several years of anonymized patient medical records
to Google, thus supplying it with the information needed to
“train” the software’s algorithms. A Data Use Agreement
governed the transfer. Restricting Google’s use of the rec-
ords to a list of specific research-related activities, the
agreement expressly prohibited the company from attempt-
ing to identify any patient whose records were disclosed.
    The anonymized electronic records subject to the agree-
ment included those of Matt Dinerstein, twice an inpatient at
the hospital during the period covered by the records disclo-
sure. Dinerstein sued Google and the University on behalf of
himself and a class of other patients whose anonymized
records were disclosed. He alleged several theories of liabil-
ity. He first claimed that the University had breached either
an express or an implied contract traceable to a privacy
notice he received and an authorization he signed upon each
admission to the Medical Center. Alternatively, he asserted a
claim for unjust enrichment. Citing the same notice and
authorization, he also alleged that the University had re-
neged on its promise of patient confidentiality and therefore
violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Busi-
ness Practices Act, 815 ILL. COMP. STAT. 505/1 et seq. Against
Google, he asserted claims for unjust enrichment and tor-
tious interference with his contract with the University.
No. 20-3134                                                     3

Finally, he brought a privacy claim against all defendants
based on allegations of intrusion upon seclusion.
    The district judge dismissed the consumer-fraud claim
for lack of standing and the rest of the suit for failure to state
a claim. We agree with her decision to dismiss the case, but
our analysis begins and ends with standing. Dinerstein has
not adequately alleged standing to pursue any of his claims.
To sue in federal court, a plaintiff must plausibly allege (and
later prove) that he has suffered an injury in fact that is
concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, and tracea-
ble to the defendant’s conduct. The injuries Dinerstein
alleges lack plausibility, concreteness, or imminence (or
some combination of the three). Because the complaint fails
to plausibly allege an injury in fact, we affirm but modify the
judgment to reflect a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of
standing.
                         I. Background
   Our factual account is drawn from Dinerstein’s amended
complaint. We begin with a description of his inpatient stays
at the University Medical Center—and more particularly,
the paperwork he received at the start of each admission.
Dinerstein alleges that he was first admitted to the Medical
Center on June 4, 2015, and was discharged three days later.
He was then readmitted on June 25, this time for a two-night
stay. Upon each admission Dinerstein received a Notice of
Privacy Practices detailing the University’s confidentiality
obligations and the circumstances in which it might use or
disclose patient medical information. Relevant here, the
notice stated that the University would obtain “written
permission” for the sale of such information. Patient permis-
sion was not required, however, for the University to use or
4                                                       No. 20-3134

share the information in limited research-related circum-
stances. In addition to the notice, Dinerstein received and
signed an Admission and Outpatient Agreement and Au-
thorization. By doing so he affirmed that he understood that
his medical information might be shared for approved
research purposes and that if so, he would “not be entitled to
any compensation.” He further acknowledged that “all
efforts” would “be made to protect [his] privacy” and that
“any use of [his] medical information” would comply with
both the notice and “federal and state laws.”
   During Dinerstein’s two hospital stays, the University
compiled records of his vital readings, medical procedures,
prescriptions, test results, and diagnoses. The records also
contained demographic information. After each discharge
from the hospital, the Medical Center maintained electronic
copies of his patient records.
     Approximately two years after Dinerstein’s hospital vis-
its, Google announced that it had partnered with the Univer-
sity to research new healthcare technology. With the help of
machine learning, the research partners aspired to develop
predictive modeling software that would improve the ability
of medical providers to forecast their patients’ medical needs
and, in turn, to tailor subsequent medical care. As described
in promotional statements, the project had the potential to
prevent medical complications, reduce hospital visits, and
improve overall health and well-being. 1

    To reliably predict medical outcomes, the models needed
extensive information from which to learn. The University
thus agreed to transfer to Google a large set of anonymized
patient medical records. A Data Use Agreement executed by
the partners in December 2016 governed the transfer. While
most of the agreement’s provisions are irrelevant for our
purposes, a few deserve mention. First, the agreement
contemplated that before disclosure the University would
strip the patient records of all direct identifying information
except the dates of medical events and services. Second, the
agreement delineated the records’ authorized uses. In par-
ticular, Google was permitted to use the records only to
identify key medical information, to develop predictive
models, and to assess the models’ efficacy. It could neither
disclose information from within the records nor use the
records in contravention of federal law. Most importantly,
the agreement strictly prohibited Google from using the
records “to identify any individual.” Third, if the parties’
research efforts proved successful, the agreement granted
the University a perpetual license to use the predictive
models for its own “internal non-commercial research
purposes.”
   The batch of medical records covered by the Data Use
Agreement spanned several years. Specifically, the agree-
ment directed the University to transfer to Google anony-
mized records generated from all inpatient, outpatient, and
emergency adult-patient encounters between January 1,
2010, and June 30, 2016. Both of Dinerstein’s overnight stays
occurred in June 2015, so his medical records were included
in the set disclosed to Google. Dinerstein alleges that the
University never obtained his consent—written or other-
6                                                  No. 20-3134

wise—for the third-party record disclosure. Nor did Google
seek permission to use his records.
     Dinerstein filed suit against the University and Google
seeking damages and injunctive relief on behalf of himself
and a class of patients whose anonymized records were
disclosed. He raised seven claims for relief. Against the
University he alleged claims for breach of an express or an
implied contract premised on the notice he received and the
authorization he signed upon each admission to the Medical
Center. More to the point, Dinerstein alleged that in ex-
change for his payment and personal medical information,
the University had agreed to protect and secure his infor-
mation. By sharing it with Google, the University had failed
to uphold its end of the bargain. As an alternative to his
contract claims, Dinerstein sought damages for unjust
enrichment. He also alleged a claim for violation of the
Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices
Act. This statutory claim rested on the alleged broken prom-
ises, which Dinerstein asserted the University never intend-
ed to keep in the first place.
    Turning to Google, Dinerstein alleged that the company
had tortiously interfered with his contract with the Universi-
ty. He also asserted a claim for unjust enrichment based on
the company’s receipt of valuable patient medical records.
Finally, Dinerstein brought a tort claim against Google and
the University for invasion of privacy. More specifically, he
alleged that they had intruded upon his seclusion by send-
ing and receiving his sensitive medical information.
   Relevant to this last theory of liability, Dinerstein claimed
that while he was an inpatient at the Medical Center, he had
used a smartphone with geolocation capabilities. Because he
No. 20-3134                                                   7

had also downloaded various Google apps, he alleged that
the phone granted the company access to his precise location
during every moment of his hospital stays. He further
alleged that if Google compared his location data with the
insufficiently anonymized patient records, it could easily
ascertain his identity and uncover “intimate private details”
in his medical histories. And he alleged that Google could do
the same thing with other class members’ geolocation data.
   The defendants moved to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1)
and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They argued
that Dinerstein had not alleged a concrete injury to support
Article III standing and, alternatively, that he had not stated
a cognizable claim. The judge granted the motion, agreeing
primarily with the latter argument and dismissing the
complaint in its entirety.
    On the standing issue, the judge construed Dinerstein’s
allegations about a lost benefit of the bargain as sufficient to
support standing to sue on the contract (and contract-
alternative) theories against both the University and Google.
Dinerstein v. Google, LLC, 484 F. Supp. 3d 561, 574 (N.D. Ill.
2020). She also reasoned that the allegations about an inva-
sion of privacy—in the form of a wrongful disclosure of his
private medical information—supported Dinerstein’s stand-
ing to sue for intrusion upon seclusion. Id. at 575. But the
judge dismissed the consumer-fraud claim for lack of stand-
ing because “[a] claim under [the Illinois Consumer Fraud
and Deceptive Business Practices Act] requires a showing of
actual damages,” which Dinerstein had not alleged. Id. at 579
(citing 815 ILL. COMP. STAT. 505/10a(a)).
   Moving on, the judge dismissed the claims for breach of
contract—express or implied—for failure to state a cogniza-
8                                                 No. 20-3134

ble claim because Dinerstein had not adequately pleaded
economic damages, a required element under Illinois law. Id.at 590–93; FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). Next, the judge noted but
chose not to decide the question whether Dinerstein’s claim
for tortious interference with contract necessarily fell with
the other contract claims. Instead, she held that the claim
failed for a separate reason: Dinerstein had not sufficiently
pleaded that Google had intentionally caused the University’s
breach of contract. Id. at 593. (Intent is necessary to state a
claim of tortious interference with contract in Illinois. HPI
Health Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., 
545 N.E.2d672, 676 (Ill. 1989).)
    Turning to the privacy claim, the judge observed that
Dinerstein had recharacterized his original intrusion-upon-
seclusion claim as a novel tort claim for breach of medical
confidentiality, a theory not yet recognized in Illinois. The
judge thought it unlikely that the Illinois Supreme Court
would recognize such a claim, so she declined to permit
Dinerstein to pursue it in federal court. That left only the
unjust-enrichment claims. Because unjust enrichment is not
an independent cause of action in Illinois, the judge dis-
missed those claims as well. Dinerstein appealed.
                        II. Discussion
    The dismissal order rests partly on a failure to allege
Article III standing but mostly on the judge’s conclusion that
Dinerstein failed to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted. Our review of either basis for dismissal is de novo.
Nowlin v. Pritzker, 34 F.4th 629, 632 (7th Cir. 2022). The
parties primarily focus on whether the amended complaint
satisfies the statutory and common-law pleading require-
ments particular to each claim. But the threshold question is

standing, which “is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.”
Nettles v. Midland Funding LLC, 983 F.3d 896, 899 (7th Cir.
2020).
    Standing doctrine traces its origins to Article III of the
Constitution, which grants federal courts the power to
resolve “Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2.
The doctrine’s elements are well established and familiar. To
sue in federal court, a plaintiff must have suffered (1) a
concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent injury (an
“injury in fact”) (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant
and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial
decision. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).
“[A]t the pleading stage, the plaintiff must clearly … allege
facts demonstrating each element.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,
578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (quotation marks omitted). Moreo-
ver, “standing is not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs
must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press
and for each form of relief that they seek.” TransUnion LLC v.
Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208 (2021).
    Like many of our recent cases concerning Article III
standing, this one hinges on the injury-in-fact element, and
in particular, the concreteness and imminence requirements.
While the concreteness requirement examines the substance
of a plaintiff’s asserted injury, the imminence requirement
measures its likelihood. In other words, to provide a basis to
sue in federal court, an injury must exist “in both a qualita-
tive and [a] temporal sense.” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 
495 U.S.149, 155 (1990).
   Starting with the qualitative aspect, “[a] concrete injury
must be de facto; that is, it must actually exist.” Spokeo,
578 U.S. at 340 (quotation marks omitted). Endorsing the

term’s “usual meaning,” the Supreme Court has described a
concrete injury as one that is “real[] and not abstract.” Id.(quotation marks omitted). Both tangible and intangible
harms may fit the bill, even if tangible harms like “physical
or monetary injur[ies]” are perhaps more intuitively con-
crete. TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204. As the Court has ex-
plained, our task—especially when the plaintiff asserts an
intangible harm—is to assess whether the alleged injury has
“a close relationship to a harm traditionally recognized as
providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts.” Id.(quotation marks omitted). The inquiry asks whether the
plaintiff has “identified a close historical or common-law
analogue” for his asserted injury. Id. Put another way, when
reviewing a plaintiff’s alleged injury for concreteness,
“[h]istory and tradition remain our ever-present guides.”
Pierre v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc., 29 F.4th 934, 938 (7th Cir.
2022).
    Imminence is more of an “elastic concept.” Lujan,
504 U.S. at 564 n.2. While it lacks a precise framework, the
basic function of the imminence requirement “is to ensure
that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III
purposes.” Id. Accordingly, a plaintiff who has not suffered
a past harm cannot simply rest on allegations that he may
suffer some “possible future injury,” Whitmore, 
495 U.S. at158, “at some indefinite future time,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564n.2. His threatened injury instead must be “certainly impend-
ing” to satisfy Article III. Id. And importantly, while an
imminent risk of future harm may suffice to support stand-
ing to sue for prospective relief (i.e., an injunction), a claim for
damages requires a concrete harm that has in fact occurred.
TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11.

    With these fundamental standing principles in mind, we
turn to the claims presented in this case. At the outset,
however, we note that Dinerstein omitted from his opening
brief any discussion about the claims for unjust enrichment
or breach of an implied contract. By doing so, he abandoned
these claims on appeal, and we need not consider them. See
White v. United States, 8 F.4th 547, 552 (7th Cir. 2021); see also
FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring that the appellant’s
brief include his “contentions and the reasons for them”).
What remains is the privacy claim, the claim for breach of an
express contract, the consumer-fraud claim, and the claim
for tortious interference with contract. We address each in
turn.
A. Privacy Claim
    We begin with the alleged breach of privacy because the
asserted injury underlying this claim is common to all claims
that remain live on appeal. In other words, our resolution of
the standing issue on this claim necessarily resolves portions
of others, streamlining our discussion of the claims that
follow.
    Before diving into the standing analysis, we must discern
what, exactly, Dinerstein’s privacy claim is. His complaint
characterizes the defendants’ conduct as a common-law
intrusion upon seclusion, which is potentially actionable
when the alleged tortfeasor “intentionally intrudes, physical-
ly or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another.”
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 652(B) (AM. LAW INST.
1977) [hereinafter RESTATEMENT]. The Illinois Supreme Court
has adopted this definition of the tort, describing the pur-
pose of the seclusion right as “protecting a person from
another’s prying into their physical boundaries or affairs.”
12                                                  No. 20-3134

W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Krishna Schaumburg Tan, Inc.,

Nat’l Bank, 534 N.E.2d 987, 988–89 (Ill. 1989).
    Apparently accepting that neither defendant’s conduct
fits the elements of this tort, Dinerstein abandoned his
intrusion-upon-seclusion theory below, as the district judge
noted. Dinerstein, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 594. In his response to
the defendants’ motion to dismiss, Dinerstein reframed his
privacy claim as a breach of medical confidentiality, a novel
cause of action that posits a common-law duty of medical
providers to maintain patient confidentiality. Several states
have recognized some variety of this tort. See, e.g., Lawson v.
Halpern-Reiss, 212 A.3d 1213, 1219 (Vt. 2019); Byrne v. Avery
Ctr. for Obstetrics & Gynecology, P.C., 175 A.3d 1, 17 (Conn.
2018); McCormick v. England, 494 S.E.2d 431, 437 (S.C. Ct.
App. 1997). But Illinois is not one of them. Dinerstein there-
fore invited the district judge, sitting in diversity, to hold
that the Illinois Supreme Court would recognize the tort
under Illinois law. See Zahn v. N. Am. Power & Gas, LLC,
815 F.3d 1082, 1087 (7th Cir. 2016) ([W]e must use our own
best judgment to estimate how the [Illinois] Supreme Court
would rule as to its law.” (quotation marks omitted)). As
we’ve noted, the judge declined that invitation. Dinerstein,
484 F. Supp. 3d at 595.
   More importantly for our purposes, however, Dinerstein
has chosen to stick with the new version of his privacy claim
on appeal. He premises his privacy-related challenges
exclusively on the novel medical-confidentiality theory.
Following his lead, then, we focus our discussion of standing
on the reframed privacy theory.
No. 20-3134                                                   13

    Dinerstein presents his privacy injury in two forms, one
backward-looking and the other forward-looking. But
considered in either direction—past or future—his asserted
injury does not establish standing to sue.
   1. Past Harm
    We start with the backward-looking form of injury. Cru-
cially, Dinerstein does not allege that Google has already
used the disclosed patient records to discern his identity.
Instead he focuses on the conduct of the University, arguing
that the record transfer was itself an actionable invasion of
his medical privacy. This is so, Dinerstein asserts, regardless
of whether Google ever actually identifies him.
    By referencing a common-law privacy invasion,
Dinerstein attempts to compare his asserted injury to a harm
“traditionally recognized as providing a basis for lawsuits in
American courts.” TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204. In other
words, he engages with the proper inquiry under the
Supreme Court’s recent standing caselaw. But as we’ve
explained, an “invasion of privacy” is not a standalone tort;
the term “encompasse[s] four theories of wrongdoing: intru-
sion upon seclusion, appropriation of a person’s name or
likeness, publicity given to private life, and publicity placing
a person in a false light.” Pucillo v. Nat’l Credit Sys., Inc.,
66 F.4th 634, 639–40 (7th Cir. 2023) (quoting Persinger v. Sw.
Credit Sys., L.P., 20 F.4th 1184, 1192 (7th Cir. 2021)); see also
RESTATEMENT §§ 652A–652E. And because TransUnion
requires us to nail down a particular common-law analogue,
we must assess whether any of the recognized privacy torts
is sufficiently analogous to Dinerstein’s asserted injury. If
not, no concrete harm. “No concrete harm, no standing.”
TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2214.
14                                                         No. 20-3134

    Of the four traditional privacy tort theories, the closest
comparator to Dinerstein’s new theory is probably the tort of
publicity given to private life, which occurs when someone
“gives publicity” to a “highly offensive” matter “concerning
the private life of another” that “is not of legitimate concern
to the public.” RESTATEMENT § 652D. Yet Dinerstein has
identified no case in which a court has permitted a plaintiff
to bring a public-disclosure tort premised on the dissemina-
tion of anonymized information. 2 Indeed, while the relevant
caselaw is sparse, we’re skeptical that this alleged factual
scenario would give rise to any injury at all—let alone one
concrete enough to support Article III standing. See, e.g.,
Shulman v. Grp. W Prods., Inc., 955 P.2d 469, 489 n.12 (Cal.
1998) (“[C]omplete lack of identification or identifiability
would seemingly defeat a private facts claim, as there could
be no injury … .”); Harris ex rel. Harris v. Easton Publ’g Co.,
483 A.2d 1377, 1385 (Pa. 1984) (“Absent an ability to identify
the complainant, there can be no communication and hence,
no publicity.”); cf. Frobose v. Am. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 
152 F.3d602, 618 (7th Cir. 1998) (rejecting a false-light claim because
the communication neither mentioned the plaintiff by name
nor made her “readily identifiable to the public”).
    Resisting this conclusion, Dinerstein contends that the
University’s records were insufficiently anonymized. He
cites a presentation from the 2017 Google Cloud Next con-
ference by Dr. Samuel Volchenboum, the University’s
Associate Chief Research Informatics Officer. Dinerstein
argues that Dr. Volchenboum’s presentation highlighted

2 Nor has Dinerstein identified a case in which a court has permitted a
plaintiff to bring the novel claim of breach of medical confidentiality in
circumstances like these.
No. 20-3134                                                           15

various deficiencies in the “typical de-identification pro-
cess.” 3 He contends that the process risks leaving identifying
clues like the patient’s age, place of residence, and family
relations scattered throughout the purportedly “de-
identified” medical records. According to Dinerstein, such
clues are routinely found in the treating physician’s “free-
text” clinical notes. If these clues are pieced together,
reidentification is supposedly simple.
    But Dinerstein’s complaint omits any allegations linking
the so-called “typical de-identification process” described in
Dr. Volchenboum’s presentation to the University’s de-
identification process here. Put differently, just because some
de-identification processes might be deficient, we cannot
assume that the University’s process was necessarily so. To
the contrary, the complaint acknowledges that the chal-
lenged record transfer occurred pursuant to the Data Use
Agreement, which states that “the majority of [patient]
identifiers will be removed,” leaving only “actual dates of
[medical] service and events.” Dinerstein’s allegations of
insufficient anonymization therefore do not cross the plausi-
bility threshold. See Silha v. ACT, Inc., 807 F.3d 169, 174 (7th
Cir. 2015) (“[T]he Twombly-Iqbal facial plausibility require-
ment for pleading a claim is incorporated into the standard
for pleading subject matter jurisdiction.”).
    Moreover, Dinerstein appears to concede that the Uni-
versity adequately discharged its de-identification obliga-
tion. Describing a jointly authored article from the
University and Google, the complaint states that although

“the [date stamps] from the University patients’ records
were maintained,” the records otherwise had been “de-
identified.” And aside from the date stamps, Dinerstein does
not pinpoint any information within the records that he
thinks should have been redacted and was not. Nor does he
allege that the date stamps alone were impermissibly identi-
fying. At most he alleges that some personally identifying
information “may have evaded redaction”—a hypothetical
that does not support his repeated but conclusory assertions
that the University’s records were insufficiently anony-
mized. “Such … bare assertion[s] of harm—unsupported by
any concrete details”—do not suffice to allege a plausible,
concrete injury. Nowlin, 34 F.4th at 633.
     2. Risk of Future Harm
    That brings us to Dinerstein’s allegations of a forward-
looking privacy injury. Unlike the backward-looking injury,
this injury turns on Google’s conduct—or more precisely, its
anticipated conduct. At bottom, Dinerstein worries that the
date stamps contained in the transferred medical records,
along with the geolocation and demographic data collected
from his smartphone apps, offer Google a “perfect formula-
tion of data points” for later reidentification. In other words,
the record transfer created a risk that he might someday be
reidentified.
   To the extent that Dinerstein rests his claim for damages
on allegations of future risk, the argument is a nonstarter. In
TransUnion the Supreme Court clarified that unless a “risk of
future harm materializes,” a plaintiff may rely on an “immi-
nent and substantial” risk of harm only when “pursu[ing]
forward-looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from
occurring.” 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11 (emphasis added). Or as our
No. 20-3134                                                   17

court has summarized: “A plaintiff seeking money damages
has standing to sue in federal court only for harms that have
in fact materialized.” Pierre, 29 F.4th at 938. Because
Dinerstein alleges no material harm arising from the alleged
risk of future reidentification, that future risk cannot support
standing to sue for damages.
    The alleged risk does not support standing to sue for in-
junctive relief either, though for a different reason: the risk
Dinerstein alleges is not sufficiently imminent. To be sure,
Google possesses a wealth of data about most, if not all,
Americans. Yet Dinerstein ignores that the governing Data
Use Agreement expressly prohibited Google from using the
transferred medical records—either by themselves or in
tandem with data already in its possession—“to identify any
individual.” And even if the contractual obligation doesn’t
itself foreclose the risk of reidentification, Dinerstein has not
alleged that Google has taken any steps to identify him. Nor,
for that matter, does he allege that Google intends to do so.
Without any allegations to that effect, “we cannot simply
presume a material risk of concrete harm.” TransUnion,
141 S. Ct. at 2212 (quoting Ramirez v. TransUnion LLC,
951 F.3d 1008, 1040 (9th Cir. 2020) (opinion of McKeown, J.)).
The risk of future injury is thus nowhere near “certainly
impending”; it is too speculative to satisfy the imminence
requirement for a suit for injunctive relief in federal court.
   Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 568 U.S. 398 (2013),
supports this holding. In Clapper attorneys and human-rights
organizations raised constitutional challenges to § 1881a of
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, arguing that
individuals with whom they regularly communicated were
probable targets of foreign electronic surveillance under the
18                                                   No. 20-3134

Act. Id. at 406. Because of the possibility of surveillance, the
plaintiffs claimed that their international communications
were likely to be incidentally “acquired under § 1881a at
some point in the future.” Id. at 407.
    The Court rejected this alleged future injury as a basis for
standing, reasoning that it rested on multiple layers of
“highly speculative fear.” Id. at 410. In particular, the “chain
of contingencies”—specifically that (1) the government
would choose to target their foreign contacts pursuant to its
§ 1881a authority; (2) the government would succeed in both
securing the requisite authorization and intercepting the
targeted communications; and (3) the plaintiffs would be
parties to those communications—“d[id] not satisfy the
requirement that threatened injury must be certainly im-
pending.” Id. The plaintiffs had offered little more than
speculation and assumptions—and importantly, “no specific
facts”—that their communications would actually be ac-
quired. Id. at 412. So too here. Dinerstein has expressed only
a “highly speculative fear” that Google might, “at some
point in the future,” identify him. Id. at 407, 410.
    Our decisions in Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Group, LLC,
794 F.3d 688 (7th Cir. 2015), and Lewert v. P.F. Chang’s China
Bistro, Inc., 819 F.3d 963 (7th Cir. 2016), are not to the contra-
ry. As an initial matter, both predate TransUnion. While that
is not to say that they are no longer authoritative, it is to
recognize that TransUnion marked a shift in the Court’s
standing jurisprudence. But even on their own terms,
Remijas and Lewert do not help Dinerstein’s standing argu-
ment here. In both cases we held that the plaintiffs had
sufficiently alleged a substantial risk of future harm stem-
ming from breaches of their credit-card information. Remijas,
No. 20-3134                                                               19

794 F.3d at 693–94; Lewert, 819 F.3d at 967. Motivating our
decisions was the common-sense observation that hackers
steal private credit-card information for a primary purpose:
“to make fraudulent charges or assume … consumers’
identities.” Remijas, 794 F.3d at 693; Lewert, 819 F.3d at 967.
Therefore, the plaintiffs’ allegations about a substantial risk
of future harm had “cross[ed] the line from conceivable to
plausible.” Lewert, 819 F.3d at 968 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).
    The same cannot be said here. Absent from this case is a
comparable indication—rooted in common sense or other-
wise—that Google’s primary purpose in obtaining the
medical records was to reidentify the University’s patients.
Indeed, the fact that Google explicitly agreed not “to identify
any individual” is enough to rule out the contention that the
threat of reidentification is certainly impending. Quite the
opposite; that contention is wholly speculative and implau-
sible. It cannot supply the basis for standing. 4
B. Contract Claim
   Next we assess the alleged injuries underlying
Dinerstein’s claim for breach of an express contract, a claim


4  Even if Dinerstein’s asserted privacy injury—past or future—were
sufficient to support standing (it is not), we see no reason to disturb the
judge’s decision not to recognize a novel claim for breach of medical
confidentiality. Illinois courts have not yet weighed in on the issue, and
“it is not our role to break new ground in state law.” Roppo v. Travelers
Com. Ins. Co., 869 F.3d 568, 596 (7th Cir. 2017) (quoting Lopardo v. Fleming
Cos., 97 F.3d 921, 930 (7th Cir. 1996)). This is especially true with
“[i]nnovative state law claims,” which “should be brought in state
court.” Insolia v. Philip Morris Inc., 216 F.3d 596, 607 (7th Cir. 2000). But
because Dinerstein lacks standing, we have no need to address this issue.
20                                                     No. 20-3134

he brings only against the University. Recall that Dinerstein
roots the University’s purported contractual duty in the
Notice of Privacy Practices he received and the Admission
and Outpatient Agreement and Authorization he signed
each time he was admitted to the Medical Center. He argues
that these documents contractually obligated the University
to safeguard his medical information. In his view, transfer-
ring his medical records to Google was a flagrant breach of
that obligation.
    To support standing to bring this claim, Dinerstein as-
serts three injuries. The first stems from his interest in priva-
cy—i.e., the injury we’ve already addressed and deemed
insufficient to support standing. The second, presented in
two forms, is pecuniary: Dinerstein contends that he overpaid
the University for his medical treatment or, alternatively,
that the University underpaid him for the interest in his
medical records. The third is contractual: Dinerstein con-
tends that the University’s breach of contract is itself an
actionable concrete injury.
     1. Pecuniary Harms
    We turn first to Dinerstein’s alleged pecuniary injuries,
which the Supreme Court has described as “traditional
tangible harms” that “readily qualify as concrete injuries
under Article III.” TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2204. Even if
concrete, however, Dinerstein’s allegations of injury must be
plausible “to survive dismissal for lack of standing.” Diedrich
v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, 839 F.3d 583, 588 (7th Cir. 2016)
(citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)); see also Silha,
807 F.3d at 174. While Dinerstein alleges both an overpay-
ment and underpayment theory of financial harm, neither is
plausible and neither supplies a basis for standing.
No. 20-3134                                                  21

    Dinerstein’s overpayment theory rests on allegations that
the medical care he (more precisely, his insurer) purchased
came bundled with a promise of medical confidentiality.
Because the University failed to deliver on that promise, he
contends that he was deprived of the full benefit of his
bargain. Not only that, he also would not have purchased
the University’s medical treatment had he known that it
intended to share his private health information.
    This is not the first time we’ve confronted an argument
like this one. In Remijas, 794 F.3d at 694–95, and Lewert,
819 F.3d at 968, the plaintiffs argued that they had overpaid
Neiman Marcus and P.F. Chang’s, respectively, because the
companies had failed to protect their credit-card infor-
mation. While we did not outright reject the plaintiffs’
theories, we expressed serious skepticism. We described the
plaintiffs’ injuries in Remijas, for example, as “problematic.”
794 F.3d at 694. And in both cases we explained that courts
have not entertained the overpayment theory of injury
outside the product-liability context, and we saw no need to
extend it “beyond its current scope.” Lewert, 819 F.3d at 968;
Remijas, 794 F.3d at 695.
    Dinerstein has not alleged a defect in his medical care,
and we again are not inclined to recognize the overpayment
theory outside the product-liability context. (In this case that
would require extending it “from a particular product to the
operation of [an] entire” medical facility. Remijas, 
794 F.3d at695.) Perhaps anticipating this doctrinal problem, Dinerstein
tries to distinguish Remijas and Lewert, arguing that the
overpayment theories in those cases were implausible
because the companies had not charged an extra fee for
credit-card transactions. In other words, the plaintiffs had
22                                                  No. 20-3134

not paid for credit-card data security. But this case is no
different. It is wholly implausible—and Dinerstein alleges
nothing to the contrary—that the University charged a
discrete “patient-confidentiality fee.” Indeed, the fact that it
reserved the right to share patient medical information for
approved research purposes suggests exactly the opposite.
So too does the fact that Dinerstein signed a release stating
that he would “not be entitled to any compensation, regard-
less of the value of such research or any products or inven-
tions developed therefrom.”
    Dinerstein’s most helpful case is from another circuit. In
Carlsen v. GameStop, Inc., 833 F.3d 903, 909 (8th Cir. 2016), the
Eighth Circuit held that the plaintiff had alleged an “actual”
financial injury “in an amount equal to the difference be-
tween the value of [what] he paid for and the value of [what]
he received, i.e., a [digital magazine] subscription with
compromised privacy protection.” As our decisions in
Remijas and Lewert make clear, we’re not inclined to extend
the overpayment theory of injury to novel contexts. Regard-
less, Carlsen is also distinguishable for the reason we just
mentioned: Dinerstein’s overpayment injury is particularly
implausible given his express agreement that his medical
information “may be used and shared for research.” And his
argument that he would not have paid for the University’s
medical services had he known otherwise is similarly im-
plausible.
    We are even more skeptical of Dinerstein’s second pecu-
niary theory—that the unauthorized use of his medical
information conferred a financial benefit on the University to
which he is entitled. This financial benefit apparently came
in the form of the perpetual software license reserved for the
No. 20-3134                                                 23

University in the Data Use Agreement. To remedy the
University’s unjust benefit, Dinerstein suggests that the
court could order disgorgement or “at least a reasonable
royalty.”
    Putting aside the fact that Dinerstein agreed that he was
not entitled to compensation for the use of his medical
information, his asserted injury cannot supply a basis for
standing. As an initial matter, Illinois law does not grant a
patient a property interest in his medical records; they
instead belong to the medical provider. Young v. Murphy,
90 F.3d 1225, 1236 (7th Cir. 1996) (“While Illinois law permits
a patient to inspect and copy his records … , there is no basis
for concluding that this grants a property interest in those
records to the patient.”); Holtkamp Trucking Co. v. Fletcher,
932 N.E.2d 34, 43–44 (Ill. App. Ct. 2010).
    Additionally, this standing theory is squarely foreclosed
by our caselaw. In Silha we held “that a plaintiff’s claim of
injury in fact cannot be based solely on a defendant’s gain; it
must be based on a plaintiff’s loss.” 807 F.3d at 174–75.
There, students who had taken standardized college admis-
sions tests alleged that the testing agencies had shared their
personal information with educational institutions. The
students had consented to information sharing, yet the
agencies had not disclosed that they had profited from what
was really a sale of the students’ information. Id. at 171.
While the complaint highlighted the agencies’ profits, miss-
ing was any allegation that the students had “lost anything
of value as a result of the alleged misconduct.” Id. at 175.
Because their claimed injury was “based solely on a gain” to
the agencies, we held that the students had not established
an injury in fact. Id.24                                                No. 20-3134

    So too here. Dinerstein has not alleged that the Universi-
ty’s use of his medical information somehow deprived him
of its economic value. And although Dinerstein attempts to
distinguish Silha by arguing that unlike him, the students
had consented to disclosure, nothing about our resolution of
the case turned on consent. Silha’s controlling principle—
that a plaintiff cannot base an injury in fact solely on the
defendant’s gain—likewise controls here. In sum, neither of
Dinerstein’s alleged pecuniary injuries establishes standing
to sue under Article III.
     2. Breach of Contract
    What’s left, then, is Dinerstein’s argument that a breach
of contract is itself a legally cognizable injury in fact. He
contends that common-law courts traditionally entertained
claims for breach of contract regardless of whether the
plaintiff alleged any harm beyond the breach itself. From
this he infers that an allegation of a breach of contract is
enough, without more, to support Article III standing. In his
view, our caselaw supports his interpretation, and the
Supreme Court’s recent standing cases, namely Spokeo and
TransUnion, do not disturb it.
    Even if Dinerstein’s historical account is correct, we read
the Court’s recent standing cases differently. In TransUnion
the Court confirmed that “an injury in law is not an injury in
fact.” 141 S. Ct. at 2205. That statement itself might be
enough to resolve Dinerstein’s “breach-alone” standing
theory. Yet to explain why our view diverges from
Dinerstein’s and that of one of our sister circuits, some
additional unpacking is warranted.
No. 20-3134                                                     25

    As we’ve already discussed, establishing an injury in fact
requires a plaintiff to show that he has suffered a concrete
injury—one that is both “real” and “de facto” and that “actu-
ally exist[s].” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340. Refining the concrete-
ness requirement, the Court in TransUnion emphasized the
distinction between (1) the cause of action giving a plaintiff
the right to sue over a defendant’s legal infraction and
(2) the injury, if any, that he suffered as a result. 
141 S. Ct. at2205. To sue in federal court, a plaintiff must have both; a
suitable cause of action cannot save a plaintiff’s case if he has
suffered no harm. In other words, only a plaintiff who has
been “concretely harmed” by the defendant’s legal infraction
“may sue that private defendant over [it] in federal court.”
Id.    Applying these concepts here, Dinerstein cannot rest on
the University’s alleged breach of contract as a discrete de
facto injury supporting his standing to sue in federal court. It
is at most an injury in law, which we know from TransUnion
“is not an injury in fact.” Id. (emphasis added). As one
scholar put it:
       The logic of Spokeo—that standing cannot rest
       on violations of legal rights that do not result
       in factual harms—extends to suits alleging
       breach of contract. After all, contracts simply
       establish legal rights. By Spokeo’s reasoning, a
       plaintiff should not have standing to sue for
       breach of contract if the breach does not result
       in some additional factual harm.
F. Andrew Hessick, Standing and Contracts, 89 GEO. WASH. L.
REV. 298, 313 (2021). Slightly rephrased, Dinerstein cannot
simply allege a bare breach of contract, “divorced from any
26                                                No. 20-3134

concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of
Article III.” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341. Without an allegation
that the purported breach resulted in some concrete harm,
we lack the “freewheeling power” to hold the University
accountable for its alleged “legal infraction[].”Casillas v.
Madison Ave. Assocs., Inc., 926 F.3d 329, 332 (7th Cir. 2019).
    Yet Dinerstein retorts that Spokeo and TransUnion are ir-
relevant to the standing question here because neither
addressed common-law claims like breach of contract. He
reads the cases to answer only whether (and if so, when)
Congress may “elevate to the status of legally cognizable” an
injury that was “previously inadequate in law.” TransUnion,
141 S. Ct. at 2204–05 (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341). To be
sure, Spokeo and TransUnion did address and decide those
questions. But we read the standing principles expounded in
those cases to extend beyond the statutory context. The
Court’s opinion in TransUnion, for example, set out to an-
swer the broader question: “What makes a harm concrete for
purposes of Article III?” Id. at 2204. In answering that ques-
tion, the Court issued important and broadly applicable
statements, including those just mentioned, about the
boundaries of the federal judicial power. Fairly interpreted,
those statements apply to all asserted injuries, not just
statutory violations.
    To give a few more examples of TransUnion’s capacious
language, the Court observed that where a “plaintiff has not
suffered any physical, monetary, or cognizable intangible
harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a
lawsuit in American courts,” his “lawsuit may not proceed.”
Id. at 2206. And it defended “the concrete-harm require-
ment” as “essential to the Constitution’s separation of
No. 20-3134                                                   27

powers.” Id. at 2207. Article III does not empower federal
courts “to publicly opine on every legal question” or to
“exercise general legal oversight … of private entities.” Id. at
2203. Yet by asking us to weigh in on the University’s al-
leged breach of contract in the absence of any actual harm,
Dinerstein invites us to function “not as an Article III court,
but as a moot court,” and do exactly that. Uzuegbunam v.
Preczewski, 141 S. Ct. 792, 804 (2021) (Roberts, C.J., dissent-
ing). We decline the invitation. Taking up such matters “is,
by very definition, for a court to act ultra vires.” Steel Co. v.
Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102 (1998).
    These general standing principles guided the Court as it
then considered when Congress may give a real-world
injury “actionable legal status.” TransUnion, 
141 S. Ct. at2205. And contrary to Dinerstein’s view, the Court’s framing
of this more specific question also supports our reading of its
recent caselaw. Rather than ask whether federal courts may
depart from established standing doctrine when Congress
has attempted to define an injury, in Spokeo and TransUnion
the Court explored when a congressionally defined injury
might satisfy the existing doctrine. The cases speak, for
example, about Congress’s lack of authority to “erase
Article III’s standing requirements,” Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339(quotation marks omitted), and about our obligation to
“independently decide whether a plaintiff has suffered a
concrete harm under Article III” notwithstanding Congress’s
creation of new statutory duties, TransUnion, 
141 S. Ct. at2205. Simply put, Spokeo and TransUnion established “fun-
damental standing principles,” id. at 2207, and those princi-
ples control this case.
28                                                           No. 20-3134

    If Spokeo and TransUnion leave any doubt about whether
a breach of contract is itself a concrete injury, Thole v. U.S.
Bank N.A., 140 S. Ct. 1615 (2020), resolves it. Thole involved
claims for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. Two
participants in a defined-benefit retirement plan sued the
bank contending that it had mismanaged the plan. But
crucially, they had sustained no monetary injury from the
mismanagement. Id. at 1618. The Supreme Court thus af-
firmed the Eighth Circuit’s dismissal for lack of standing and
in so doing rejected the participants’ attempted trust-law
analogy. “[A] defined-benefit plan,” the Court reasoned, “is
more in the nature of a contract. The plan participants’
benefits are fixed and will not change, regardless of how
well or poorly the plan is managed.” Id. at 1620 (emphasis
added). Because the Court held that the plan participants
nonetheless lacked standing to pursue their claims, we
understand Thole to imply that an alleged breach of contract,
without any corresponding actual harm, does not give rise to
an Article III case or controversy. 5
   Nor are we persuaded by Dinerstein’s argument that the
Court’s instructions in Spokeo and TransUnion—that we must
compare the plaintiff’s asserted injury to harms traditionally
recognized at common law—resolves the standing question
here. As we understand the argument, he contends that


5 In fact, the dissent raised this precise point. Thole v. U.S. Bank N.A.,
140 S. Ct. 1615, 1630 (2020) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (reasoning that the
plan participants had standing because a “breach of contract always
creates a right of action, even when no financial harm was caused”
(quotation marks omitted)). That the majority was not persuaded by this
view further supports our conclusion that a breach of contract does not
by itself confer standing to sue.
No. 20-3134                                                           29

because common-law courts allowed a plaintiff to vindicate
his contractual rights without a further showing of injury, he
need not allege anything aside from the University’s bare
breach of contract.
    True, common-law courts historically heard contract cas-
es and awarded nominal damages even when the breach
either “caused no loss” or “the amount of the loss [wa]s not
proved.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 346(2) (AM.
LAW INST. 1981); see also Springer v. Cleveland Clinic Emp.
Health Plan Total Care, 900 F.3d 284, 292–93 (6th Cir. 2018)
(Thapar, J., concurring) (“[Common-law courts] entertained
breach-of-contract claims even when no real loss [could] be
prove[n]. Such violations at least deserved nominal damag-
es … .” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Yet “[t]he
requirements of Art[icle] III are not satisfied merely because
a party … has couched [his] request for forms of relief
historically associated with courts of law in terms that have a
familiar ring to those trained in the legal process.” Valley
Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church &
State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).
    More importantly, however, Spokeo and TransUnion put
an end to federal courts hearing claims premised on nonex-
istent injuries—regardless of historical pedigree.6 And the
Court’s recently announced “historical-analogue test” does
not suggest otherwise. That test asks whether a modern
injury bears a “close relationship” to a harm traditionally

6 See William Baude, Standing in the Shadow of Congress, 2016 S. CT. REV.
197, 217 (“[I]t is hard to see how nominal damages are fully consistent
with the logic of Spokeo. The very premise of nominal damages is that
one cannot show any ‘actual injury’ apart from the violation of the legal
right itself.” (citing Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978))).
30                                                 No. 20-3134

recognized by common-law courts. TransUnion, 
141 S. Ct. at2204. It does not, however, transform into a concrete factual
injury what the common law has historically regarded as a
legal injury. Put differently, a historical record is no talis-
man. It is necessary, but not sufficient, to satisfy the
Article III concreteness requirement.
    Still, because Dinerstein views Spokeo, TransUnion, and
Thole as inapposite, he argues that our prior decision in J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. McDonald, 760 F.3d 646 (7th Cir.
2014), binds us. Relevant here, at issue in J.P. Morgan was
whether a bank had standing to block an ongoing arbitration
proceeding that two investors had initiated after losing
approximately a quarter of their initial investment. The
contracts governing the investors’ accounts included a
forum-selection clause that required disputes to be brought
in either state or federal court. Id. at 649. Seeking to enforce
the forum-selection provision, the bank sued the investors in
federal court. After months of litigation, the judge dismissed
the bank’s claims for lack of standing. Id. at 650.
    Reversing the dismissal, we held that the bank had
standing to enforce the clause. To form a bilateral contract,
each party must “take on one or more legally binding obliga-
tions,” we explained. Id. “When one party fails to honor its
commitments, the other party to the contract suffers a legal
injury sufficient to create standing even where that party
seems not to have incurred monetary loss or other concrete
harm.” Id. at 650–51. Because the bank had alleged that the
investors had “violated the terms of th[eir] bargain” by
selecting an improper dispute-resolution forum, it had
established standing to sue. Id. at 651.
No. 20-3134                                                    31

    Dinerstein understandably seizes on this favorable lan-
guage, but he omits the discussion that follows it. We went
on to explain in J.P. Morgan that the bank had “a very real
financial interest in the arbitration” because it was statutori-
ly and contractually obligated to “foot the bill” for the
resulting costs. Id. Given this independent financial interest,
the standing question was not merely “one of abstract
principle”; it was yet another reason why the bank had
standing to sue. Id.    The concrete harms present in J.P. Morgan—being hauled
into an improper forum and financing the resulting costs—
distinguish it from this case. Moreover, while those harms
prevent us from needing to revisit J.P. Morgan, we note that
some language in the opinion is in tension with the Supreme
Court’s recent decisions in Spokeo and TransUnion. No longer
is “a legal injury sufficient to create standing.” J.P. Morgan,
760 F.3d at 651. “[U]nder Article III, an injury in law is not
an injury in fact. Only those plaintiffs who have been con-
cretely harmed” by a defendant may sue in federal court.
TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2205. Any portion of our opinion in
J.P. Morgan that suggests otherwise cannot control here.
    Finally, we recognize that some tension also exists be-
tween our analysis here and that of a few of our sister cir-
cuits. There is no direct conflict, however. For starters, many
of the out-of-circuit decisions pointing in the other direction
predate TransUnion, a watershed decision on the standing
doctrine. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 
953 F.3d529, 536 (8th Cir. 2020); Springer, 900 F.3d at 287; Katz v.
Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2012). Of the circuits to
consider the issue post-TransUnion, we understand one to
agree with our position, Perry v. Newsom, 18 F.4th 622, 632
32                                                  No. 20-3134

(9th Cir. 2021) (“An analogy to a traditionally recognized
cause of action does not relieve a complainant of its burden
to demonstrate an injury.”); one to leave it unresolved,
Glennborough Homeowners Ass’n v. U.S. Postal Serv., 
21 F.4th410, 415–16 (6th Cir. 2021) (“We need not resolve these
thorny questions today … .”); and one to come out the other
way, Denning v. Bond Pharmacy, Inc., 50 F.4th 445, 451 (5th
Cir. 2022) (“[A] breach of contract is a sufficient injury for
standing purposes.”). But the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in
Denning did not engage with the logic of Spokeo and
TransUnion and rested in part on its own precedent. We
therefore do not understand the Fifth Circuit’s decision to
conflict with our own, nor are we inclined to adopt its
approach. As we read Thole, TransUnion, and Spokeo, a
breach of contract alone—without any actual harm—is
purely an injury in law, not an injury in fact. And it therefore
falls short of the Article III requirements for a suit in federal
court.
C. Remaining Claims
    We need not spend much time addressing the tortious-
interference and consumer-fraud claims. Both rest on the
same allegations of a privacy, pecuniary, or contractual
injury that we’ve already examined and deemed insufficient
to confer standing.
    Put simply, Dinerstein seeks to invoke the power of the
federal courts to challenge the lawfulness of an event that
caused him no harm. But federal courts do not offer “judicial
determination[s] that the plaintiffs’ interpretation of the law
is correct”; we resolve cases and controversies. Uzuegbunam,
141 S. Ct. at 804 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Because
Dinerstein has not alleged a plausible, concrete, and actual
No. 20-3134                                            33

or imminent injury to support his standing to sue, no such
case or controversy exists here. We accordingly modify the
judgment to reflect a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of
standing. As modified, the judgment is
                                                AFFIRMED.","https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9415218/matt-dinerstein-v-google-llc/?type=o&type=o&q=google&order_by=score+desc","{

                            CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION

                IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

                              SIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT

 ERIC MAYRON,                                      H044592
                                                  (Santa Clara County
          Plaintiff and Appellant,                 Super. Ct. No. CV275940)

          v.

 GOOGLE LLC,

          Defendant and Respondent.


        In this putative class action, plaintiff Eric Mayron sued Google LLC for violating
the automatic renewal law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17600, et seq.) and for unfair
competition (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et seq.). Plaintiff appeals after the trial court
sustained Google’s demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. We conclude
there is no private right of action for violation of the automatic renewal law. Further,
since plaintiff has not alleged an injury caused by Google’s conduct, he has no standing
to sue under the unfair competition statute. We will therefore affirm the judgment.
                                      I. BACKGROUND
        California’s automatic renewal law was enacted “to end the practice of ongoing
charging of consumer credit or debit cards [] without the consumers’ explicit consent for
ongoing shipments of a product or ongoing deliveries of service.” (Bus. & Prof. Code,
§ 17600 (unspecified statutory references are to this code).) The law requires a
consumer’s affirmative consent to any subscription agreement automatically renewed for
a new term when the initial term ends. (§ 17602, subd. (a)(2).) It further requires “clear
and conspicuous” disclosure of the offer terms, and an “easy-to-use mechanism for
cancellation.” (§ 17602, subds. (a)(1), (b).)
       Plaintiff sued Google on behalf of a putative class, alleging that Google’s
subscription data storage plan violates the automatic renewal law. As described in the
complaint, “Google Drive” allows users (those registered for a Google account) to
remotely store electronic data that can be accessed from any computer, smartphone, or
similar device. There is no charge for 15 gigabytes of storage capacity. For a $1.99
monthly fee, users can upgrade to 100 gigabytes of storage. Plaintiff alleged the
upgraded Google Drive plan violates the automatic renewal law because Google did not
provide the required clear and conspicuous disclosures nor obtain his affirmative consent
to commence a recurring monthly subscription agreement, and did not adequately explain
how to cancel.
       Plaintiff asserted one cause of action for violation of the automatic renewal law,
and another for statutory unfair competition based on the alleged unlawful practice.
Google demurred to the complaint. It argued there is no private right of action under the
automatic renewal law and that plaintiff did not allege actual injury sufficient to confer
standing for an unfair competition claim. The trial court ultimately sustained the
demurrer without leave to amend.
                                   II.    DISCUSSION
       Appellate review of a decision sustaining a demurrer is de novo. (Moore v.
Regents of University of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125.) We assume the truth of
the allegations in the complaint and determine whether a valid cause of action is stated
under any legal theory. (Doan v. State Farm General Ins. Co. (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 1082, 1091.)


   A. THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF
      ACTION
       A private party can sue for violation of a statute only where the statute in question
allows it. (Lu v. Hawaiian Gardens Casino, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 592, 596 (Lu).) We


                                             2
first examine the statutory text to see if it contains “ ‘clear, understandable, unmistakable
terms,’ which strongly and directly” indicate a private right of action is allowed. (Id. at
p. 597.) The statute may, for instance, refer to obtaining a remedy or enforcing its
provisions “by way of an action.” (Ibid.) Where the text does not contain an
unmistakable directive, the legislative history may indicate whether the Legislature
intended to create a private cause of action. (Id. at p. 598.)
       Plaintiff asserts section 17604 of the automatic renewal law clearly shows intent to
create a private right of action. Entitled “Violations; Civil remedies,” that section
provides: “violation of this article shall not be a crime. However, all available civil
remedies that apply to a violation of this article may be employed.” Plaintiff reads the
reference to “all available civil remedies” to mean that a private party can sue for any
remedies available under the civil law, such as damages or an injunction. Plaintiff’s
interpretation is not unreasonable. While a remedy is not the same thing as a cause of
action, a statute that says all available remedies can be employed for a violation suggests
a right of action exists, since one cannot obtain a remedy without a viable cause of action.
       At the same time, we are mindful there must be a “clear, understandable,
unmistakable” indication of intent to allow a private right of action. It is not enough that
the statutory text suggests such a right. (See Lu, supra, 50 Cal.4th 592 at p. 597.) A
clear indication means the text cannot be reasonably susceptible of competing
interpretations. The language here is susceptible of more than one meaning. As we have
noted, plaintiff’s interpretation is plausible. But so is the one urged by Google—that the
phrase “all available civil remedies … may be employed” does not mean what plaintiff
says but rather the opposite: it specifically indicates an intent not to create a new cause
of action but to require enforcement through existing means (such as through Business
and Professions Code section 17200, et seq., which allows individuals harmed by
unlawful business practices to seek restitution and injunctive relief). We find that the
statute’s somewhat imprecise phrasing—“all available civil remedies that apply to a
                                              3
violation of this article may be employed”—is not sufficiently clear to conclude in the
affirmative that a private individual may sue for a violation.
       Plaintiff argues general rules of statutory interpretation, such as the rule against
surplusage, dictate that the reference to remedies should be given effect as creating a
cause of action. But a more specific rule controls in this context: the rule that in order to
create a private right of action the Legislature must clearly express that intent.
       Section 17603 similarly contains no clear indication of intent to create a private
right to sue. Section 17603 provides that “any goods, wares, merchandise, or products”
sent to a consumer under a subscription agreement that violates the automatic renewal
law “shall for all purposes be deemed an unconditional gift to the consumer, who may
use or dispose of the same in any manner he or she sees fit.” That provision relieves the
consumer of any obligation to return what has already been received and ensures the
consumer has no liability for the products. But it does not follow from that language (at
least not with sufficient clarity) that a consumer may affirmatively bring an action to
enforce the statute. That is in contrast to the statute considered in Goehring v. Chapman
University (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 353, 377, cited by plaintiff. There the court found a
private right of action in Business and Professions Code section 6061, subdivision (h),
which requires certain disclosures by unaccredited law schools and mandates that any
school in violation “shall make a full refund of all fees paid by students.” As the
Legislature “unquestionably intended to bestow students or former students with
individual monetary claims, it must have intended to give them private rights of action to
pursue such claims.” (Goehring v Chapman University, at p. 378.) Section 17603 is
different because it provides only a passive right to retain any products received from a
violator, rather than a right to pursue a refund of fees a claimant could show had been
paid. We also note that Goehring was decided several years before Lu, and therefore did
not apply the Supreme Court’s guidance regarding the clarity with which the Legislature
must express its intent to create a private right of action.
                                               4
       We draw further support for our conclusion that the statutory text does not show
an intent to create a private cause of action from the fact that the Legislature has in many
instances demonstrated its ability to clearly express such an intent. Numerous statutes
contain clear, unmistakable language regarding private enforcement that is much more
explicit than the language used here. (See Lu, supra, 50 Cal.4th 592, 597, listing statutes
with a private right of action including Health & Saf. Code, § 1285, subd. (c) [“Any
person who is detained in a health facility solely for the nonpayment of a bill has a cause
of action against the health facility for the detention”]; Lab. Code § 218 [“Nothing in this
article shall limit the right of any wage claimant to sue directly or through an assignee for
any wages or penalty due him under this article”]; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17070 [“Any
person ... may bring an action to enjoin and restrain any violation of this chapter and, in
addition thereto, for the recovery of damages”]; Bus. & Prof. Code § 6175.4, subd. (a)
[“A client who suffers any damage as the result of a violation of this article by any
lawyer may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain one or more of the
following remedies”]; Civ. Code, § 1748.7, subd. (d) [“Any person injured by a violation
of this section may bring an action for the recovery of damages, equitable relief, and
reasonable attorney's fees and costs”].) Had the Legislature wanted to create a private
right of action for violation of the automatic renewal law, it could have said so. We find
its choice not to is significant.

       But even without clear statutory language, legislative history can reveal the
Legislature’s intent to create a private right of action. 1 (Lu, supra, 50 Cal.4th 592, 598.)
Again though, it must be “clear” that was the intent. (Id. at p. 597.) The legislative
history of the automatic renewal law contains no clear statement about an individual’s
right to sue under the statute. There is no mention of a private right action at all. And the
relevant material does not support plaintiff’s argument. Under a heading that reads

       We grant plaintiff’s request for judicial notice of the legislative history of the
       1

automatic renewal law.
                                              5
“Remedies available under the bill”—where one would expect reference to a private right
of action if one were contemplated—the bill’s author instead notes violations can be
enforced through Business and Professions Code section 17200, which allows a private
party to “bring a civil action for injunctive relief and/or for restitution of profits that the
defendant unfairly obtained from that party.” (Sen. Ellen Corbett, Chair of Senate
Judiciary Committee, letter to Sen. Yee, 2009-2010 reg. session.) The legislative
history’s reference to enforcement by way of a different statute is a strong indication that
no independent private right of action was intended by the new law.
       Seeing no clear indication of intent to create a private right of action in either the
statutory text or its legislative history, we conclude there is no such right under the
automatic renewal law. Plaintiff urges that outcome is contrary to the remedial purpose
of the statute and will undermine its consumer protection function. But the automatic
renewal law can be enforced with an action brought by the Attorney General. A private
individual can also pursue enforcement through an unfair competition lawsuit, if
economic loss resulted from the violation—an issue we turn to next.

   B. STANDING TO SUE FOR UNFAIR COMPETITION REQUIRES ACTUAL INJURY AND
      CAUSATION
       In addition to his claim for violation of the automatic renewal law, plaintiff alleged
a cause of action against Google under Business and Professions Code, section 17200,
et seq., which prohibits unfair competition. “Section 17200 ‘borrows’ violations from
other laws by making them independently actionable as unfair competitive practices.”
(Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1143.) The
statutory violation plaintiff imports here is Google’s alleged violation of the automatic
renewal law.

       The unfair competition statutes come with an express standing requirement,
however. An action can be brought only “by a person who has suffered injury in fact and
has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.” (§ 17204.) It is not
                                                6
enough that a plaintiff lost money; to have standing, there must be a causal link between
the unlawful practice and the loss. (Hall v. Time, Inc. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 847, 849[“We hold the phrase ‘as a result of’ in the [Unfair Competition Law] imposes a
causation requirement; that is, the alleged unfair competition must have caused the
plaintiff to lose money or property.”].)
       The statutory violations alleged by plaintiff are that Google did not provide
required disclosures and did not make it easy enough to cancel the subscribed service. To
establish standing, plaintiff would also need to allege that he ordered increased Google
Drive storage but would not have done so had the disclosures been provided, or that he
would have cancelled the additional storage had it been easier to do so. (See, e.g.,
Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 317 (Kwikset) [plaintiffs who can
truthfully allege they were deceived by a product’s label into purchasing the product and
would not have purchased it otherwise, have “lost money or property” within the
meaning of section 17204].) But plaintiff makes no such allegation, which suggests he
would have purchased and maintained the added Google Drive capacity even if Google
had complied with the automatic renewal law. The complaint therefore does not show a
causal link between plaintiff’s payments and Google’s alleged violations. (Daro v.
Superior Court (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1098 [“In short, there must be a causal
connection between the harm suffered and the unlawful business activity. That causal
connection is broken when a complaining party would suffer the same harm whether or
not a defendant complied with the law.”].)
       Plaintiff contends he has standing based on the unconditional gift provision of the
automatic renewal law, which allows a consumer to keep “any goods, wares,
merchandise, or products” sent under a continuous service agreement that is not in
compliance with the law. (§ 17603.) Any such goods “shall for all purposes be deemed
an unconditional gift to the consumer, who may use or dispose of the same in any manner
he or she sees fit without any obligation whatsoever on the consumer’s part to the
                                             7
business, including, but not limited to, bearing the cost of, or responsibility for, shipping
any goods, wares, merchandise, or products to the business.” (Ibid.) In plaintiff’s view,
the effect of that provision is that he paid for a product the law deems a gift. In other
words, he asserts that he lost money as a direct result of Google’s alleged statutory
violation because he paid for something he did not need to pay for.
       Plaintiff’s standing argument misses the crucial requirement of causation. The
unconditional gift provision of the automatic renewal law creates a right to retain a
product already received. That right is a consequence of violating the statute. But a
consequence imposed on a defendant for violating a statute is not the same thing as a loss
caused by the defendant’s conduct. (Kwikset, supra, 51 Cal.4th 310, 335–336 [eligibility
for a remedy and standards for causation under section 17200 are “wholly distinct”].)
The relevant inquiry for standing purposes is whether a defendant’s unlawful conduct
caused the plaintiff to part with money. In the context of this case, the questions are
twofold: whether Google’s failure to adequately disclose that the Google Drive storage
plan would automatically renew each month caused plaintiff to spend money he
otherwise would not have spent; or alternatively, whether Google’s failure to provide an
easy cancellation mechanism caused plaintiff to continue to spend money on a service he
would have discontinued (which he characterizes as a gift under the law).
       Whether a loss was caused by the defendant is what matters for standing, not any
resulting consequence imposed by statute. An example demonstrates the point: suppose
the automatic renewal law imposed a statutory penalty of $1,000 for each violation. The
mere existence of the penalty—a consequence of violating the statute—does not mean the
defendant caused a consumer’s loss that is separate and distinct from the penalty. An
after-the-fact right provided by the Legislature cannot amount to causation. Nor should a
penalty imposed on a vendor be viewed as the source of injury to a consumer.
       Plaintiff cites two federal district court cases and an unpublished Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals case which concluded the unconditional gift provision does confer
                                              8
section 17200 standing. But we are not persuaded by the reasoning in those cases. In
Roz v. Nestle Waters North America, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2017) 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5177,
the court’s basis for finding standing was that “[w]hen the Defendant then collected
money in return for that ‘gift,’ it injured the Plaintiffs because it took money that the
Plaintiffs did not owe. Therefore, the charges must qualify as an injury.” (Id. at p. 22).
The Roz court’s analysis ignores the requirement that the consumer’s injury must be
caused by the defendant’s misconduct; that is, caused by the defendant’s failure to
provide the required disclosures. Lack of a causal link between the underlying statutory
violation and the nature of the plaintiff’s loss precludes standing under section 17200.
The other district court case plaintiff cites, Lopez v. Stages of Beauty (S.D. Cal. 2018)
307 F.Supp. 3d 1058, 1070, relies on Roz and applies the same reasoning.
       In Johnson v. Pluralsight, LLC (9th Cir. 2018) 728 Fed.Appx. 674, 676–677, the
Ninth Circuit decided a plaintiff asserting a section 17200 claim premised on an
automatic renewal law violation established standing in federal court under Article III of
the United States Constitution, and the court summarily concluded that “for the same
reasons he has satisfied Article III’s injury-in-fact requirement, he has alleged an injury
in fact sufficient to support statutory standing under [section 17200].” But federal
Article III standing is far broader than the standing requirement contained in
section 17200, which expressly requires a financial loss caused by the defendant’s
conduct. As the California Supreme Court explained in Kwikset, supra, 
51 Cal.4th 310,324, “because economic injury is but one among many types of injury in fact, the []
requirement that injury be economic renders standing under section 17204 substantially
narrower than federal standing under article III, section 2 of the United States
Constitution, which may be predicated on a broader range of injuries.” The Johnson
court’s conclusion that the plaintiff had section 17200 standing rests on a faulty premise.
       Because we conclude that the unconditional gift provision of the automatic
renewal law does not confer standing for a section 17200 cause of action, we need not
                                              9
reach the issue of whether the gift provision applies only to tangible goods and not to a
data storage plan like Google Drive.
       Plaintiff has no private cause of action under the automatic renewal law, and he
has not properly alleged causation of an economic loss as required to bring a claim under
section 17200. The trial court therefore correctly sustained Google’s demurrer to the
complaint. And as plaintiff has not shown how he would amend the complaint to change
its legal effect, there was no abuse of discretion in denying leave to amend. (Rosen v.
St. Joseph Hospital of Orange County (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 453, 458.)
                                  III.   DISPOSITION
       The judgment is affirmed. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.

                          Industrial Accident Board,
                               AFFIRMED.

Delaware. Attorney for Claimant Below- Appellant and Cross Appellee.

John J. Ellis, Esquire, HECKLER & FRABIZZIO, P.A., Wilmington, Delaware.
Attorney for Employer Below- Appellee and Cross-Appellant.




BUTLER, R.J.
                                   Background

        This matter is an appeal and cross appeal from decisions of the Delaware

Industrial Accident Board (“IAB” or “Board”) concerning a claim made by

Claimant, Matthew Hoskins (“Claimant”) and his then employer, Appellee

Amazon.com (“Employer”).

        Claimant was working as a “picker” at an Amazon fulfillment center in

Middletown, Delaware. In August, 2021, while so engaged, he was bending over a

bottom bin when a coworker reached up behind him to retrieve items from the top

of the bin, dislodging some merchandise boxes that then fell and hit Claimant on his

back. He reported the injury but continued to work for Amazon for another 5 months

or so, eventually quitting on account of his continuing complaints about his back

pain.

        After the August injury, Claimant saw Doctor Balu for treatment of his back

pain. Dr. Balu took a medical history from Claimant and reviewed a recent MRI,

noting “lumbar lordosis and bulging discs at the L5-S1 level” as well as a herniated

disc at the L4-5 level. Claimant was treated with injections and put on work

restrictions.

        In the face of continued complaints of pain, Dr. Balu gave Claimant anti-

inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxers and further injections.


                                         1
      Claimant also consulted a neurosurgeon, Dr. Pulak Ray, who proposed lumbar

surgery “due to severe degenerative disc disease at L4-5 causing foraminal stenosis.”

      The cost of the surgery is what provoked Claimant to petition the IAB for

“Additional Compensation Due.”         Claimant had already been receiving full

disability benefits since leaving Amazon. He now sought an Order from the IAB

that the Employer would be responsible for the surgery bills from Dr. Ray.

      Thus, the critical issue, as discussed by the IAB in its Opinion denying

compensation, was whether the need for surgery was causally related to the incident

in August 2021, when the boxes fell on the Appellant.

                       Procedural History – Issues in Dispute

      While the Court appreciates that the causal relationship between the

workplace incident and the need for surgery on Claimant’s spine is the central issue

on appeal, the pleadings have become further complicated by collateral issues that

are either waived or moot. The following is offered by way of explanation.

      When Claimant filed his claim for Additional Compensation Due, the

Employer countered with a “Petition for Review,” a request to terminate Claimant’s

total disability benefits on the ground that he was physically able to return to work.

Employer had two witnesses to support this claim, a medical expert, Doctor Close,




                                          2
and a vocational expert, Truman Perry, to present a “labor market survey” of jobs

available in the area.

         For reasons not relevant to this appeal, the IAB barred Dr. Close’s testimony.

Despite the Employer’s motion to reargue and/or to continue the proceedings, the

Board’s ruling kept him out of the hearing. Without its medical expert, the Employer

presented the labor market expert anyway, apparently believing the testimony would

support its request to terminate Claimant’s total disability benefits.

         Ultimately, the Board did not accept Employer’s argument that Claimant was

not totally disabled. This rendered the labor market survey of no value to the

Employer and a non-issue in this dispute.

         The Employer filed a cross appeal on the denial of its Petition for Review. It

identified the Board’s refusal to allow the testimony of its medical expert Dr. Close

as its grounds for this appeal. The Employer did not, however, address this issue in

its Answering Brief or otherwise. That issue is therefore waived and will not be

considered further.

         As to the vocational expert who did testify, the Claimant protested the

admissibility of this testimony in its Opening Brief, even though Claimant did not

identify that issue in its Notice of Appeal. 1 The Court has enough to do without



1
    See Notice of Appeal, Trans. ID 70167531 (June 8, 2023).
                                                 3
rendering advisory opinions. The vocational expert was a non-factor in the Board’s

decision.

       Moreover, Superior Court Rule 72 requires that “In all appeals from the

Industrial Accident Board, where the claimant accepts part of the award while

appealing the remainder of the award, the notice of appeal must specify that portion

of the award accepted.” 2 Claimant’s Notice of Appeal not only failed to identify the

admissibility of the vocational expert’s testimony, it affirmatively represented that

the appeal was “limited to the Board’s denial of Claimant’s petition for surgical

authorization” and it was “not appealing the denial of the Employer’s Petition for

Review.”3 Thus, the argument raised in Claimant’s Opening Brief concerning the

admissibility of the vocational expert is not preserved for review.

       Finally, Claimant’s Reply Brief raises, for the first time, an argument seeking

affirmation of the Board’s refusal to permit the testimony of Employer’s expert, Dr.

Close. The problem here is that the Employer did not raise this issue in its briefing

at all, apparently choosing to abandon the question before briefing. The question is

not properly raised or preserved. The Court will not consider an issue raised for the

first time in a reply brief.4

Corp. v. Barton, 2008 WL 142510, at *1 n.5 (Del. Super. Jan. 15, 2008)).
                                              4
         With all of that said, we will now move on to the single issue that is properly

preserved for review.

    I.      The Board’s Ruling Was Supported by Substantial Evidence

               a. Causation is a question of fact.

         Is the causal relationship between the Appellant’s need for back surgery and

his workplace incident a question of fact or a question of law? The case law and the

Restatement are virtually unanimous that causation is a question of fact.5 Thus, the

Board’s conclusion that Appellant’s need for surgery was not caused by his

workplace injury may not be second guessed by this Court.

         Perhaps understanding that this is a problem for Claimant, he says instead that

“whether the Board committed legal error and the opinions of the Claimants treating

doctors should have been rejected is a question of law and is reviewed de novo” 6

citing Duvall v. Charles Connell Roofing. 7

         But that is not what Duvall v. Charles Connell Roofing says. Rather, in

Duvall, the Supreme Court reversed precedent concerning the “unusual exertion”

rule to the availability of worker’s compensation when injuries occur on a worksite.8


5
  See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 434(2); Duphily v. Delaware Elec. Co-op, Inc., 
662 A.2d821, 830 (Del. 1995) (“This Court has consistently held that the issue of proximate cause is
ordinarily a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.”).

  564 A.2d 1132 (Del. 1989).
8
  See id.                                               5
This change was a change of law, not one of fact. 9 Indeed, Appellant’s argument

asks the Court to revisit the Board’s credibility determination that the surgery was

not causally related to the workplace injury and find instead that it was. This is not

something the Court is going to do.

    II.      The Claimant’s Credibility was Properly at Issue.

                a. Claimant misrepresented his medical history to his doctors.

          Certainly, there are diagnostic images that support the fact that the Appellant

suffered from bulging discs and the like. The doctors saw them and testified that

these physical images depict the pain that the Claimant was suffering from. But it

is naïve to suggest that the images themselves tell the whole story. Pain is reported

by the claimant to the doctor, who then goes searching for its source. But the search

begins with the report of the claimant, making the claimant’s credibility a crucial

ingredient in the diagnostic and treatment process.

          The Claimant repeatedly reported to his doctors that he had no prior back

problems, and that all of his pain stemmed from the boxes that fell on him at Amazon




9
  The Court in Duvall held that “[w]e believe that abandoning the unusual exertion rule and its
patent inequities is consistent with the statutory principle that compensation be paid ‘for personal
injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of employment.’ [and that] [i]n the
absence of contrary legislation, therefore, we adopt the ‘usual exertion’ rule. Under this principle,
an injury is compensable if the ordinary stress and strain of employment is a substantial cause of
the injury.” Id. at 1133.


                                                 6
in August, 2021. The medical testimony was predicated on their assumption that

Claimant had not previously sought treatment for back pain.

         But the evidence showed that Claimant had been to Bayhealth Medical Center

in 2014 with complaints of lumbar pain and a diagnosis of mild degenerative

changes. He had a lumbar MRI done. And in 2020, before he started working for

Amazon, he went to the emergency room at Bayhealth, complaining of chronic back

pain. X-rays taken then indicated “back pain at the L4-5 level occurring over six

weeks.” And on a second visit to Bayhealth in 2020, he reported that he “slipped on

the floor and landed on his low back.”

         Thus, three hospital visits, an MRI on his back and X-rays diagnosing pain in

the L4-5 level – the very same location Dr. Ray proposed for surgery – somehow

slipped from Claimant’s memory when reporting his medical history to his doctors.

It is hardly shocking that the Board, in weighing credibility, concluded that

“Claimant's failure to report his prior low back complaints as to his lumbar history,

which was extensive and dated back to 2014, when seeking treatment with Dr. Balu

and Dr. Ray, was crucial to its determination that the lumbar surgery which he now

seeks is not reasonable, necessary, and causally related to the August 2021 work

accident.”10



10
     Board Op. at 14, Trans. ID 70167531 (June 8, 2023).
                                                 7
       As the Board properly noted in its Opinion, “[w]hether medical services are

necessary and reasonable or whether the expenses are incurred to treat a condition

causally related to an industrial accident are purely factual issues within the purview

of the Board.”11

              b. Claimant’s illicit drug use was not outcome determinative, but
                 certainly did not help his credibility.


       Claimant also complains that the Board should not have considered the fact

that he misrepresented his illicit drug use to Dr. Balu. The doctor prescribed opiates,

among other modalities, to treat Claimant’s pain, yet his screenings showed no

consumption of opiates, but positive consumption of cocaine. Claimant finally told

Dr. Balu that he was trying to quit using cocaine, but only after being confronted.

       Dr. Balu testified that denial of illicit drug use was not unusual in his practice.

Nonetheless, the Board said, his denial “does not support Claimant’s overall

credibility.”12

       Claimant refers the Court to the decision of Lemmon v. Northwood

Construction 13 for the proposition that the Board may not make compensation

decisions based upon his possible substance abuse after the fact. Lemmon involved


11
   Board Op. at 13 (citing Bullock v. K-Mart Corp., 1995 WL 339025 at *3 (Del. Super. May 5,
1995); Keil’s Wholesale Tire v. Marion, 1986 WL 18001 (Del. Oct. 27, 1986)).
12
   Board Op. at 15.
13
   690 A.2d 912 (Del. 1996).
                                              8
a painter who injured his knee in a workplace accident and then fell down some

stairs, allegedly because his knee “gave out,” injuring his back. The Board did not

believe he fell down the stairs because of his injured knee and denied further

compensation, but pointed only to the fact that he had alcohol on his breath during a

doctor’s visit in support of that conclusion. The Supreme Court ruled that alcohol

on one’s breath, months later, was not substantial evidence supporting the Board’s

conclusion that his knee had not given out, causing the fall.

      Claimant complains that there was no evidence that his cocaine use had any

part of his workplace injury or on the opinions of his medical expert, Dr. Balu. That

is true. But Claimant’s credibility in claiming to have forgotten that he had visited

the hospital on several occasions for back pain certainly was at issue.            His

truthfulness in failing to report his medical history of disease to L4-L5 of his lumbar

spine was at issue. Had the Board relied exclusively on his drug abuse to deny him

benefits, this would be a different case.

      But that was hardly the only problem with Claimant’s credibility. Rather, it

was but one factor cited by the Board as a basis for questioning his veracity. In

Lemmon, it was unclear whether the claimant fell on the stairs because people fall

on stairs sometimes or because his injured knee caused the fall. Here, Employer

agrees Claimant suffered a workplace injury to his back and the issue was whether

the planned surgery was necessitated by the workplace injury or another cause – one
                                            9
that he failed to report to his medical experts. It was not improper for the Board to

consider Claimant’s candor in assessing his credibility and his lack of candor

concerning his drug use was an appropriate factor considering his lack of candor

concerning his medical history.

                                   CONCLUSION

      For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the decision of the UIAB

must be AFFIRMED. Since no issue was raised by Employer’s cross-appeal that

is preserved for review, that appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.

      IT IS SO ORDERED.

Before Richman, Graves, and Ramirez, Circuit Judges.
Irma Carrillo Ramirez, Circuit Judge:
       Our prior panel opinion, Amazon.com Servs. LLC v. Nat’l Lab. Rels.
Bd., 136 F.4th 577 (5th Cir. 2025), is WITHDRAWN, and the following
opinion is SUBSTITUTED:
       Amazon appeals the “constructive denial” of its motion for injunctive
relief from “being subjected to [two] unconstitutional administrative
proceedings” before the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”). We
DISMISS this appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
                                      I
       Amazon is a major online retailer that receives, sorts, and ships
products from warehouses called “fulfillment centers.” In December 2021,
the Amazon Labor Union (“ALU”) filed a petition with the NLRB to
represent more than 8,000 Amazon employees at the fulfillment center in
Staten Island, New York. The election was held on April 1, 2022, and a
majority of the employees voted in favor of ALU. The election resulted in
two separate NLRB proceedings concerning the NLRB’s alleged
interference with the union election, Case 29-RC-288020 (the “Election
Case”), and Amazon’s alleged refusal to bargain with the union, Case 29-
CA-318069 (the “Bargaining Case”).
                                      A
       On April 8, 2022, Amazon initiated the Election Case by filing 25
objections, alleging that ALU and the Regional Office had interfered with the
conditions for a free and fair election. On March 31, 2022, the day before the
election, the NLRB’s Regional Director—with approval from the General
Counsel—sought an injunction ordering the immediate reinstatement of an




                                      2
Case: 24-50761       Document: 215-1       Page: 3     Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                 No. 24-50761


employee that Amazon had terminated almost two years earlier. That
employee had filed a charge against Amazon in June 2020, and the NLRB’s
Regional Office had issued a complaint against Amazon in December 2020.
Amazon claimed that the General Counsel should have sought an injunction
as soon as the Regional Office issued its complaint in December 2020, rather
than waiting until the eve of the union election. This “undermined the
integrity of the April 2022 election that the [NLRB] was obliged to supervise
neutrally.” Amazon sought to have the NLRB invalidate the election results
and order a second election.
       Amazon sought to transfer the case to a different, non-conflicted
region, and the General Counsel transferred the matter to Region 28, which
serves parts of Texas. On September 1, 2022, after a 24-day hearing, the
Region 28 Hearing Officer recommended that all of Amazon’s objections be
overruled. On January 11, 2023, the Region 28 Regional Director affirmed the
Hearing Officer’s recommendation and certified ALU as the bargaining
representative for Amazon’s Staten Island fulfillment center. On February 9,
2023, Amazon requested review of the decision, which the NLRB denied on
August 29, 2024.
                                       B
       Meanwhile, because of the election, ALU demanded that Amazon
recognize and bargain with it. It filed a charge with the Regional Office,
alleging that Amazon refused to recognize it or bargain with it as the exclusive
representative for the Staten Island employees. On July 12, 2023, the
Regional Director issued a complaint, which initiated the Bargaining Case.
       On August 23, 2023, the General Counsel moved for summary
judgment on the complaint, alleging that Amazon violated the National Labor
Relations Act by refusing to bargain with ALU until its objections were
adjudicated. The General Counsel also sought an order directing Amazon to




                                       3
Case: 24-50761       Document: 215-1       Page: 4    Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                  No. 24-50761


recognize and bargain with ALU, pay consequential damages as a “make-
whole” remedy for certain Amazon employees, and transfer the Bargaining
Case from the Regional Office to the NLRB itself.
       Later that day, the NLRB granted the motion to transfer and issued a
notice to show cause as to why the summary judgment motion should not be
granted. On August 25, 2024, the day after the NLRB denied Amazon’s
request for review in the Election Case, the NLRB issued an updated notice
to show cause in the Bargaining Case. The updated notice instructed Amazon
to file any supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion on or
before September 13, 2024.
                                       C
       On September 5, 2024, Amazon sued the NLRB in the Western
District of Texas, requesting temporary, preliminary, and permanent
declaratory and injunctive relief. It sought:
       [T]o avoid serious and irreparable harm that it will otherwise
       suffer from being subjected to unconstitutional administrative
       proceedings. Because the structure of the proceedings in
       NLRB Cases 29-CA-310869 and 29-RC-288020 violate the
       United States Constitution under Supreme Court and Fifth
       Circuit precedent, Amazon respectfully brings this action for
       declaratory and injunctive relief . . . .
Amazon also requested an “immediate” temporary restraining order and
that the district court “set a hearing for a preliminary injunction [and] issue
a preliminary injunction” because the NLRB could theoretically issue an
order any time after it filed its supplemental opposition on September 13,
2024. It did not otherwise request that the hearing—or the requested relief—
occur before a specific date.
       On September 9, 2024, the district court informed Amazon that a
local rule required that its application for a preliminary injunction must be



                                       4
Case: 24-50761           Document: 215-1          Page: 5       Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                       No. 24-50761


made in a separate motion. Accordingly, on September 10, 2024, Amazon
moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, again
seeking “immediate relief” because its brief was due by September 13, 2024,
and the NLRB was “poised” to rule “in the imminent future.” Amazon
argued that it faced imminent and irreparable harm because, if the
administrative proceedings went forward, “Amazon will lose its right not to
undergo an unconstitutional proceeding.” That same day, the NLRB moved
to transfer the case to the Eastern District of New York. The next day, on
September 11, 2024, the NLRB agreed to extend Amazon’s deadline to file
a supplemental opposition until September 27, 2024.
        The district court held a hearing on the motions to transfer and for
temporary restraining order on September 24, 2024. Amazon argued that it
needed immediate injunctive relief, because “if the [Bargaining Case
proceeding] goes forward after this Friday and [the NLRB] issues an order
granting the summary judgment, then the constitutional issues . . . are
mooted.” But it did not specifically request a ruling by a specific date.1 The
court specifically asked Amazon how fast it thought the NLRB would issue
a decision. Amazon acknowledged that the NLRB “normally [takes] weeks”
to issue a decision, but it “believe[d]” that “a ruling could issue as soon as
we file a brief” on September 27 because of the “relationship between
[Amazon] and the NLRB.”2 When asked why relief was needed immediately

        _____________________
        1
         Amazon did state that it wanted a ruling that day, but in response to the court’s
question regarding whether it wished to continue the hearing so it could be prepared to also
address the NLRB’s transfer motion.
        2
           Amazon stated that it had asked the NLRB to administratively stay the
Bargaining Case proceeding, but the NLRB refused. The NLRB responded that it was
reluctant to stay the underlying proceeding entirely because “if the Board says [it is] going
to stay our proceedings based on the filing of the Federal Court lawsuit voluntarily, that’s
just going to encourage more and more and more of these lawsuits to be filed.”




                                             5

                                       No. 24-50761


instead of after “a more orderly briefing process, considering the magnitude
of the issues,” Amazon responded that the NLRB could “theoretically . . .
issue an order Monday,” September 30. The NLRB, in turn, represented
that “a period of months, generally, is about as quick as the board can act
given its caseload.”
        The district court afforded the parties leave to raise any additional
points that had not been addressed via letter briefs filed by Friday, September
27. The court stated that it was “going to try to get this out as soon as” it
could. Amazon then asked if the court wanted the briefs by a particular time,
and the court set a deadline of noon. It then adjourned the hearing.
        Two days later, on September 26, 2024, Amazon filed a letter brief
with the district court, “a day ahead of the 12:00 p.m. Central, September
27, 2024, deadline” to give the court “as much time as possible” to consider
its request for an immediate temporary restraining order. It stated its concern
that the NLRB “could” issue its decision as early as Monday, September 30,
and for the first time advised that its “effective deadline” to seek emergency
appellate review was “Friday morning, after which time it would be “forced
to consider its motion for injunctive relief effectively denied because of the
imminence of potential Board action.” The next day, Amazon noticed the
appeal of the district court’s “constructive denial” of its motion for
temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
        On Sunday, September 29, 2024, and while the current appeal was
pending before this court, the district court granted—but stayed—the
NLRB’s motion to transfer.3 It also denied Amazon’s request for a
temporary restraining order. The district court explained that “Amazon has

          In its opening brief, Amazon contends that “[t]he district court lacked jurisdiction
to enter the order, and it has no effect on the appeal before the Court.”

                                 No. 24-50761


failed to establish a substantial threat of irreparable harm if an injunction is
not granted.” Instead, “it predicates its claim based on a claim that the
NLRB may depart from precedent and require it to provide some form of
compensation to employees for their lost opportunity to engage in collective
bargaining.” “This is both speculative and unripe,” the district court found.
       On September 30, 2024, a motions panel of this court administratively
stayed the proceedings before the district court and the NLRB and expedited
the matter to the next available merits panel.
                                      II
       At issue is whether the district court constructively denied Amazon’s
motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
       Under § 1292(a)(1), this court has jurisdiction to review interlocutory
orders, including orders that refuse or dissolve injunctions. 28 U.S.C. §
1292(a)(1). This also includes orders that do not expressly refuse an
injunction but have the “practical effect of doing so.” Carson v. Am. Brands,
Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83 (1981) (citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co.,
287 U.S. 430, 433 (1932)).
                                      III
       Amazon argues that the district court constructively denied its motion
for a preliminary injunction by failing to rule on or before September 27,
2024; as a result, it faced an injury that could not be undone—the NLRB
“consummating a final order in its unconstitutional proceeding.” We
disagree.
       Because “a motion for preliminary injunctive relief ‘must be granted
promptly to be effective,’” a district court’s failure to timely rule on motion
can amount to an “‘effective’ denial.” In re Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce,
100 F.4th 528, 533 (5th Cir. 2024). “[W]hat counts as an effective denial is




                                       7

                                  No. 24-50761


contextual—different cases require rulings on different timetables.” 
Id. at535. “District courts have wide discretion in managing their docket, and they
do not necessarily deny a motion by failing to rule on a parties’ requested
timeline.” Id. “Appeal cannot be achieved simply by asserting that the trial
court has failed to act promptly as wished by a party seeking an injunction.”
Id. “There must be a legitimate basis for [any] urgency.” Id. (citing 16
Charles Allen Wright & Arthur Miller, Federal
Practice & Procedure § 3924.1 (3d ed.)). Another consideration is the
litigant’s “diligence in seeking to expedite briefing and consideration,” such
as whether it has made “repeated requests for a ruling by a specific date.” Id.
       In Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, a group of business associations
sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, challenging a new rule that
required them to print and distribute materials about credit card late fees to
customers and provide notice of mitigating changes by March 29, 2024. 
100F.4th at 531. On March 7, the associations moved to enjoin the rule and
specifically requested an expedited ruling “within 10 days, or as soon as
possible thereafter, to prevent irrecoverable harm.” Id. at 531–32. The
district court did not rule within 10 days and instead sua sponte requested
briefing on venue on March 18. Id. The next day, the associations again
specifically requested an expedited ruling and informed the court that they
would understand the preliminary injunction to have effectively been denied
if it had not ruled by March 22. Id. The district court denied the motion for
expedited review, and without having ruled on the motion, transferred the
case to the District of Columbia on March 28. Id. We held that the district
court had effectively denied the motion for preliminary injunction because
the associations demonstrated a legitimate basis for the urgency, i.e., “the
unusually short timeline for complying with the rule.” Id. at 535. They had
also “repeatedly requested swift review,” including “repeated requests for a
ruling by specific dates.” Id. at 534.

                                      No. 24-50761


                                           A
       We first consider Amazon’s diligence in seeking expedited briefing
and consideration. Id. at 535.
       Here, unlike the business associations in Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce, Amazon did not “[make it] clear from its first filing [on September
5, 2024] that the [final order] was going into effect on an unusually short
timeline.” 100 F.4th at 534. It “made clear” that its deadline to respond to
the NLRB’s summary judgment motion was September 13, and it requested
“immediate” relief because the NLRB could issue an order any time after
that deadline. When it separately moved for a temporary restraining order
and a preliminary injunction, it again sought immediate relief on grounds that
the NLRB was “poised” to rule “in the imminent future,” without
explanation. Unlike Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, Amazon did not
“repeatedly request[] swift review.” 100 F.4th at 534. It never made a
specific request for an expedited briefing schedule, an expedited hearing, or
an expedited ruling in its filings.
       At the hearing on September 24, Amazon expressed its belief that the
NLRB could issue an order as soon as Monday, September 30, but it
acknowledged that the NLRB usually took weeks to issue a decision. And
despite an extended discussion with the district court regarding its need for
immediate injunctive relief, Amazon did not specifically request a ruling by a
specific date. When the district court set a deadline for filing letter briefs on
the same day as Amazon’s extended submission deadline, Friday, September
27, Amazon did not object. When the court stated that it would issue a ruling
as soon as it could, Amazon did not ask if a ruling would be forthcoming by
September 27 or request a ruling by that date. Nor did it advise the district
court that it would construe a failure to issue a ruling by September 27 as an
effective denial of its motion for injunctive relief. Amazon instead only asked




                                           9
Case: 24-50761      Document: 215-1       Page: 10    Date Filed: 08/28/2025




                                 No. 24-50761


if the court wanted the briefs by a particular time. On this record, we cannot
find that Amazon made clear its need, as opposed to its wish, for an expedited
ruling by September 27 to the district court at the hearing. Amazon did not
request relief by a specific date—or even expedited relief—until its letter
brief dated September 26, in which it requested for the first time that the
district court rule by the morning of September 27. During oral argument,
Amazon was also unable to identify any other specific request for a ruling by
this date. Amazon has not shown that it acted diligently.
                                      B
       Amazon also failed to establish a legitimate basis for the alleged
urgency. See Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. The
associations in Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce “made clear from [their]
first filing that the Final Rule was going into effect on an unusually short
timeline, which meant the credit card issuers had an unusually short window
of time to comply.” Id. at 534. Here, Amazon’s deadline to file its
supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion was Friday,
September 27. Nothing before the district court indicated that the NLRB
would—or even could—issue a decision as soon as Monday, September 30.
Amazon acknowledged at the preliminary injunction hearing that it normally
takes weeks for decisions to issue; the NLRB stated that “a period of
months, generally, is about as quick as [it] can act given its caseload.”
Although a certain date such as the one in Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce
is not required to show a legitimate basis for urgency, Amazon’s belief or the
theoretical possibility that the NLRB could issue a decision by September 30
does not suffice.
       Finally, this court has also considered the district court’s timeliness
in assessing urgency. Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535(“[G]iven the issuers’ unusually short timeline for complying with the Final




                                     10

Rule or obtaining injunctive relief, the district court effectively denied the
Chambers’ motion for a preliminary injunction by not promptly ruling on it and
instead opting to hear an unrelated motion sua sponte.” (emphasis added)).
See, e.g., United States v. Lynd, 301 F.2d 818, 823 (5th Cir. 1962) (finding
effective denial where the district court conducted a merits hearing on the
injunction motion and the movant “proved without question” its entitlement
to relief, but the district court unduly delayed ruling on that motion). In
contrast to Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, the district court here
conducted a hearing concerning Amazon’s motion for injunctive relief.
During that timely hearing, it specifically explored Amazon’s basis for
urgency. Although Amazon’s request for immediate relief was based only on
its belief that the NLRB could issue a decision as soon as September 30, the
district court stated its intent to issue a decision as soon as it could. And it
followed through by filing its decision on September 29, one day before the
date Amazon claimed on which NLRB “could” issue its decision. But by that
point, Amazon had already petitioned this court for relief.
       A litigant cannot “simply say they need an expedited ruling and then
appeal by claiming effective denial when they do not get it on their preferred
timeline.” Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. Amazon
neither diligently requested consideration by September 27 nor
demonstrated a legitimate basis for the urgency. The district court did not
effectively deny the motion for injunctive relief in failing to rule on or before
September 27. Because there is no effective denial, there is no interlocutory
decision before this court under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1). This appeal must be
dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
                                      IV
       Amazon’s appeal is DISMISSED for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1).

Priscilla Richman, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
        I would hold that the district court effectively denied Amazon’s
motion for a preliminary injunction, giving rise to our interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction. I respectfully dissent. Our court’s decision today says that our
jurisdiction depends on a combination of two ephemeral factors: 1) when will
it be more than “theoretically possible” an agency might act, even though
the agency was free to act when the appeal was taken; how much longer must
a party must wait to appeal—a day, a week, a month—the bar is left to
wonder, at its and its clients’ peril; and 2) how vociferously a litigant must
tell a district court the date by which it needs a ruling. In the present case,
the NLRB could have ruled at any time after noon on Friday, September 27.
The district court was advised early and often of that deadline. Amazon filed
an appeal on Friday, September 27. Yet, the court says no appeal could be
taken until an indeterminate date and time beyond September 27.

        Under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), we have jurisdiction over appeals from
interlocutory orders denying injunctive relief.1 Litigants may also, in certain
circumstances, appeal an otherwise unappealable interlocutory order that
does “not in terms ‘refus[e]’ an ‘injunctio[n],’” but nonetheless has “the
practical effect of doing so.”2 We have also “recognized that simply sitting

constructive-denial cases, we require a showing that the practical or effective
denial “threatens ‘serious, perhaps irreparable[,] consequences’ and can be
effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.”4 This showing serves as
“a safeguard against undue widening of the floodgates which currently keep

ten days; instead, on the eleventh day, the court “sua sponte requested
briefing on venue.”10 On the twelfth day, the plaintiff moved for expedited
review of its preliminary injunction motion and informed the court that if “it
did not receive a ruling by [the fifteenth day], it would understand its
preliminary injunction to be effectively denied and would accordingly seek
appellate review.”11 The district court did not rule by the fifteenth day.12 On
the eighteenth day—four days before the date for compliance—the plaintiff
appealed.13
          We concluded that the district court had effectively denied the
plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction such that we had interlocutory
appellate jurisdiction.14               We reasoned that “a motion for preliminary
injunctive relief ‘must be granted promptly to be effective.’”15 Accordingly,
“[a]mong the considerations when determining whether a district court has
waited too long to rule on a motion is ‘the urgency of preliminary relief as a
means of preserving the opportunity for effective permanent relief.’”16 In this
vein, “[t]here must be a legitimate basis for the urgency.”17 “Thus, whether

a district court fails to act promptly depends entirely on context.”18 We also
emphasized that “[f]or its part,” the moving party “acted diligently.”19
       In Fort Worth, the plaintiff had a legitimate basis for urgency because
“the Final Rule’s fast-closing window for compliance demanded faster
review of the motion for a preliminary injunction.”20 The plaintiff acted
diligently by filing suit within two days after the agency finalized the rule; by
“ma[king] clear from its first filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short
window of time to comply” with the new rule; by specifically requesting a
ruling on its preliminary injunction motion within ten days; by making
“repeated requests for a ruling by specific dates”; and by requesting
expedited briefing.21 Yet the district court failed to rule on the preliminary
injunction motion, but instead “g[a]ve its attention to” the venue issue.22
This amounted to an effective denial of the motion for a preliminary
injunction.
                                        III
       These principles support appellate jurisdiction here. While some of
the operative facts differ in degree, “what counts as an effective denial is
contextual.”23

        Amazon had a legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary
injunctive relief against the Bargaining Case. Impending summary judgment
in the Bargaining Case could moot Amazon’s district court claims,
precluding the district court’s ability to grant any relief. I am persuaded that
this would be “a ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence’” that “can be
‘effectually challenged’ only by immediate appeal” from the district court’s
effective denial of Amazon’s motion.24
        Amazon’s constitutional objections to the Bargaining Case all allege
ongoing subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker. While “[t]hat harm may
sound a bit abstract,” the Supreme Court “has made clear that it is ‘a here-
and-now injury’” district courts have jurisdiction to redress prior to the
termination of an agency proceeding.25 This injury is conceptually distinct
from an injury arising from an adverse agency order, which a party might
challenge—also on constitutional grounds—after the proceeding.26
Importantly, the here-and-now injury “is impossible to remedy once the
proceeding is over” because “[a] proceeding that has already happened
cannot be undone.”27
        Amazon and the NLRB agree that the Board could grant summary
judgment against Amazon after the September 27 show-cause deadline,
including on that same day, and the NLRB acknowledged in oral arguments

that “the administrative proceeding would likely have concluded at that
point had the Board addressed all issues in the case.” In that event, the
“proceeding is over,” and it “cannot be undone.”28 Post hoc “[j]udicial
review of [Amazon’s] structural constitutional claims”—framed as ongoing
subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker—“would come too late to be
meaningful,”29 and the district court would be unable to provide the relief
Amazon requested in its complaint. That is exactly why “preliminary relief
[functions] as a means of preserving the opportunity for effective permanent
relief.”30 Just as in Fort Worth a “fast-closing window for compliance
demanded faster review of the motion for a preliminary injunction,” a fast-
closing window before potential summary judgment in the Bargaining Case
demanded faster review here.31
       The majority opinion concludes that there was no legitimate basis for
Amazon’s urgency because there was no indication that the Board would
issue a decision on the same day as the show-cause deadline.32 To be sure,
the parties dispute how quickly the Board would likely act after the show-
cause deadline, and there is admittedly no guarantee that the Board would
grant summary judgment against Amazon, thus ending the proceedings. But
the prospect that the Board could issue an adverse decision any time after the
show-cause deadline, as the parties agree was possible, presented a legitimate
basis for urgency. In reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority opinion
states that “Amazon acknowledged at the preliminary injunction hearing that

it normally takes weeks for decisions to issue.”33 In context, however,
Amazon’s “acknowledgement” is far from any concession that the Board
issuing a decision soon after the show-cause deadline was a mere “theoretical
possibility.”34 The district court asked, “[H]ow fast do you think the Board
is going to issue a decision?” Amazon responded:
       This would certainly be a guess, although an educated one; but,
       typically, in test of certification proceedings the rulings come
       out fairly quickly, much quicker than in the normal course.
       [The court then stated: “Give me timeframes.”] Normally
       weeks, but given the posture of this case and sort of the nature
       of the—what I’ll call the relationship between our client and
       the NLRB, we believe that a ruling could issue as soon as we
       file a brief.
Even if Amazon acknowledged that it “normally” takes weeks for decisions
to issue, Amazon argued that the NLRB would likely act faster than usual in
its case. Further, we cannot consider the fact that the Board has yet to render
a decision because a motions panel of this court administratively stayed the
Bargaining Case on September 30, preventing the Board from acting.
       Similarly, although the district judge stated during the September 24
motions hearing that he intended “to try to get this [ruling on the motions]
out as soon as I can,” Amazon could not know how long the court would take,
or if the Board would grant summary judgment before the court could act.
Even though we now know that the district court issued a ruling on Amazon’s
request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) two days after Amazon
noticed its appeal, we must consider the context as it existed on September
27—the date on which Amazon had to file its response at the NLRB, thus

making ripe the General Counsel’s motion for summary judgment—not
September 29. On September 27, neither the district court nor Amazon
could know how long the Board would wait to issue a decision in the
Bargaining Case—two days, two weeks, two months, or longer. Accordingly,
I give little weight to the fact that the district court ruled on the motion two
days later.35
       Importantly, I do not see—and the majority opinion has not offered—
any principled way for us to determine whether the district court failed to
“timely rule on [Amazon’s] preliminary-injunction motion”36 other than by
tethering that inquiry to the show-cause deadline. Assume Amazon had not
noticed its appeal on September 27 and assume the district court did not
eventually act on September 29. How long after the show-cause deadline
would have been too long of a delay by the district court? At what point could
Amazon have invoked our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction on an effective-
denial theory? After the show-cause deadline arrived, no one could know,
other than the NLRB, when the Board intended to issue a decision that could
moot Amazon’s district court claims. What was certain was that the Board
could issue a ruling after the show-cause deadline, at its convenience.
       Amazon’s basis for urgency was all the more legitimate given that the
Board had the power to moot Amazon’s claims against the NLRB. To moot
those claims, the Board only had to render an adverse order quickly against
Amazon disposing of all the issues in the Bargaining Case. It is notable that
the Board apparently declined requests to defer its proceedings. According
to Amazon, “[i]mmediately after filing suit, [it] asked the Board to
administratively stay the [Bargaining Case],” but “[t]he Board refused.”

Only after the district court on September 10 scheduled the motions hearing
for September 24 did the Board on September 11 extend the initial show-
cause deadline to September 27—thus setting the deadline after the district
court’s hearing on both Amazon’s motion and the NLRB’s motion to transfer.
Amazon represented to the district court after the motions hearing that it
“again requested” that the Board stay the Bargaining Case, but the “Board
[was] unwilling to do so.” Even the district court at the motions hearing
asked the NLRB why it was not “just agreeing to stay a decision until all this
is handled.” The NLRB responded: “Because the agency obviously has an
interest in continuing its orderly processes.” But that is exactly the point:
the Board’s continuing its orderly processes, which no doubt is a legitimate
interest, could moot Amazon’s district court claims. That potential outcome
provided Amazon’s legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary relief.
                                       B
       The moving party also must act diligently. While Amazon was
arguably less diligent here than the moving party in Fort Worth, Amazon’s
efforts in this context were sufficient.
       Amazon filed suit on September 5—just six days after the Board
issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case—seeking
declaratory and permanent injunctive relief. Although the Bargaining Case
had begun a little more than a year prior, there was minimal action in the
Bargaining Case while the related Election Case proceeded; in fact, Amazon
had argued in response to the Board’s first notice to show cause that the
Board could not resolve issues in the Bargaining Case until it completed the
Election Case. The Board denied review of the Election Case on August 29,
2024, and issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case on
August 30. Amazon had little reason to challenge the effectively paused

Bargaining Case until the Election Case ended, and Amazon promptly sued
once it did.
       Amazon’s complaint also requested a TRO and a preliminary
injunction against the Bargaining Case. The complaint made clear Amazon’s
deadline to respond to the NLRB’s summary judgment motion was
September 13.37 Amazon also emphasized that its “need for a temporary
restraining order is imminent and dire because the NLRB may issue an order
in [the Bargaining Case] any time on or after September 13, 2024.” Amazon
also requested that the court “set a hearing for a preliminary injunction, and,
after a properly noticed hearing, issue a preliminary injunction.”
       On September 9, the court advised Amazon that a local rule required
submitting an application for temporary or preliminary relief in a separate
motion. Amazon filed its motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction on
September 10. Amazon’s motion reiterated the urgency it had raised in its
complaint, emphasizing that “Amazon must file any supplemental
opposition to the original Notice to Show Cause on or before Friday,
September 13, 2024” (bold, italics, and underline in original).
       Both the September 5 complaint and September 10 motion made clear
that Amazon’s show-cause deadline was (initially) September 13, after which
the Board would be poised to issue a ruling on the General Counsel’s
summary judgment motion, potentially mooting Amazon’s district court
claims. Amazon repeatedly emphasized the (postponed) September 27
show-cause deadline at the September 24 motions hearing, even stating at
one point that it “want[ed] the TRO today.” At the end of the hearing,
Amazon represented that “a TRO or preliminary injunction does need to be
granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the” Bargaining

Case “[b]ecause if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an order
granting the summary judgment [motion], then the constitutional issues
again are mooted.” Finally, Amazon’s September 26 letter brief told the
district court that Amazon would consider its motion effectively denied on
September 27.
       In my view, these facts show that Amazon “made clear from its first
filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short window of time” before it needed
injunctive relief, which it “repeated” multiple times.38 I accept that Amazon
failed until September 26 to state expressly that it would consider its motion
“effectively denied” when the show-cause deadline arrived on September
27. But it was indisputably clear from the earlier filings that Amazon, if it
were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, needed a ruling before the
show-cause deadline, after which the Board’s action could leave Amazon’s
alleged injury “impossible to remedy.”39 The NLRB argues that Amazon
tried “to impose a decisional deadline with barely one day’s notice.” Yet
even the district court commented at the motions hearing that Amazon was
“asking [it] to make a major decision on two weeks’ notice.” Given this
statement by the district court, I cannot agree with the majority opinion’s
conclusion that, by the end of the hearing, Amazon had failed to “ma[k]e
clear its need” for an expedited ruling by the show-cause deadline.40
       Ironically, whatever doubt there might have been from Amazon’s
failure to repeat some apparently talismanic phrase earlier, the NLRB’s
September 10 transfer motion made clear that “Amazon can claim that its
motion for injunctive relief has been ‘effectively denied,’ . . . [on] Friday,

                                         No. 24-50761


September 13,” which was the then-operative show-cause deadline. While
the NLRB’s brief in this court characterizes this concession as a suspicion
“that Amazon might seek to manufacture an effective-denial argument,” the
concession at the very least makes clear that the parties and district court
understood by September 10 that Amazon was seeking relief before the
Board-imposed show-cause deadline.
        The majority opinion faults Amazon for failing to object at the motions
hearing when the district court set the supplemental briefing deadline at noon
on September 27.41 I do not believe this means Amazon failed to act
diligently. Amazon had repeatedly made clear—including, by my count, five
times earlier during that very hearing—that it needed relief by the show-
cause deadline.42 Our decision in Fort Worth does not require that Amazon
have repeated its need for relief yet again.
        I do not mean to criticize the district court. “District courts have wide
discretion in managing their docket,” and “plaintiffs cannot simply say they
need an expedited ruling and then appeal by claiming effective denial when
they don’t get it on their preferred timeline.”43 Amazon asked the court to
consider complex constitutional issues on an accelerated timeline, which no
doubt placed great pressure on the court. Notably, unlike in Fort Worth—

injunction does need to be granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the
underlying [Bargaining C]ase. Because if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an
order granting the summary judgment, then the constitutional issues again are mooted.”).

where the district judge sua sponte directed his attention to another matter
entirely—the judge here took some action on Amazon’s motion by
scheduling a hearing and eventually denying the TRO after Amazon
appealed. We have declined jurisdiction where the district court has done far
less because “mere inaction is not an order refusing injunctive relief, and is
not appealable.”44          But at bottom, there was limited time in which
preliminary relief could preserve the district court’s ability to grant
meaningful permanent relief, assuming Amazon was entitled to either. Given
that legitimate basis for urgency, as well as Amazon’s relative diligence
pursuing its precise claims and the uncertainty as to what would transpire
(and when) after the show-cause deadline, I believe the principles in Fort
Worth support interlocutory appellate jurisdiction here.
                                      *        *         *
       For these reasons, I would exercise interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction to reach the merits of Amazon’s appeal. Because the court
instead dismisses the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, I respectfully dissent.

Hoffman, J.
          {¶1}     Plaintiffs-appellants      Taylor     McQueen        and   Guillermo   Martinez,   Jr.

(“McQueen” and “Martinez,” individually and “Appellants,” collectively) appeal the May 23,

2022 Judgment Entry entered by the Licking County Municipal Court, Civil Division, which

awarded them $0 in damages, following a damages hearing held after the trial court

granted default judgment in their favor. Defendant-appellee is Amazon.1

                                  STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE

          {¶2}     On November 25, 2020, Amazon employees delivered a bed frame to

Appellants’ residence. As they were carrying the bed frame into the residence, the

package struck a ceiling light which fell and struck McQueen on the head. McQueen went

to the emergency department at Licking Memorial Hospital.                       She testified she was

diagnosed with a brain injury. McQueen missed several days of work due to her injuries.

McQueen stated she continues to have issues with her memory, difficulty sleeping, and

headaches.

          {¶3}     On May 28, 2021, Appellants filed a complaint in the Licking County

Municipal Court, naming Amazon as defendant.                        Amazon failed to respond to the

complaint. Appellants filed a motion for default judgment on July 23, 2021, which the trial

court granted on August 3, 2021.

          {¶4}     The trial court conducted a hearing on damages on October 11, 2021.

          {¶5}     McQueen detailed the events giving rise to the complaint. On November

25, 2020, while Amazon delivery workers were carrying boxes containing a bed frame

into Appellants’ residence, they hit the ceiling light fixture with one of the packages. As a

Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                        3


result, the glass part of the fixture broke, fell from the ceiling, and struck McQueen on the

head.       McQueen sought medical treatment for her injuries that same day. McQueen

stated, after medical personnel performed a CT scan, she was diagnosed with a

concussion and discharged with instruction to follow-up with a neurologist the following

week. McQueen treated with the neurologist through February, 2021. She indicated she

experienced migraines, muscle weakness and numbness, and difficulty focusing.

          {¶6}    McQueen identified the medical bills she received for her treatment, which

totaled $6,223.50. She stated she had not paid any of the medical bills. McQueen

testified she missed several days of work due to her injuries.2 She also identified her

certified medical records from Licking Memorial Hospital and the neurologist. McQueen

indicated, as of the date of the hearing, October 11, 2021, she continued to experience

migraines, memory issues, and difficulty breathing when she sleeps.

          {¶7}    Martinez testified he was at home, working in the basement, on November

25, 2020, when he heard a loud thud, then McQueen crying and calling his name. He ran

upstairs to her aid. He identified photographs of the ceiling light fixture, before and after

the incident. Martinez conducted an internet search to ascertain the cost to replace the

fixture and the labor costs to install it. He stated a replacement fixture would cost between

$300-$400, based upon his search on various websites. The labor costs ranged from

$95 to $230.          Martinez also described McQueen’s initial injuries and the lingering

symptoms she suffered as a result of the incident.

          {¶8}    Following a brief argument by counsel for Appellants, the trial court took the

matter under advisement.



2
    The record fails to establish the amount of wages McQueen claims to have lost.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                 4


      {¶9}    Via Judgment Entry filed May 23, 2022, the trial court awarded no damages

to Appellants. The trial court found the documents and records pertaining to McQueen’s

medical treatment and diagnosis were inadmissible hearsay and not properly

authenticated. The trial court further found the evidence presented relative to McQueen’s

medical bills and lost wages lacked specificity and documentation, and the evidence

relative to the replacement and installation of a new ceiling light fixture was vague and

ambiguous.

      {¶10} It is from this judgment entry Appellants appeal, raising the following

assignments of error:



              THE TRIAL COURT’S ORDER AWARDING $0 DAMAGES AFTER

      A DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE

      EVIDENCE. JUDGMENT ENTRY DATED MAY 23, 2022, P. 6.



      {¶11} This case comes to us on the accelerated calendar. App. R. 11.1, which

governs accelerated calendar cases, provides, in pertinent part:



              (E) Determination and judgment on appeal

              The appeal will be determined as provided by App. R. 11.1. It shall

      be sufficient compliance with App. R. 12(A) for the statement of the reason

      for the court's decision as to each error to be in brief and conclusionary

      form.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                   5


              The decision may be by judgment entry in which case it will not be

        published in any form.



        {¶12} This appeal shall be considered in accordance with the aforementioned

rule.

                                                  I

        {¶13} In their sole assignment of error, Appellants contend the trial court’s order

awarding $0 in damages following default judgment was against the manifest weight of

the evidence. Specifically, Appellants assert the trial court erred in requiring expert

medical testimony to establish McQueen’s injury and damages. Appellant further argue

the trial court erred in awarding $0 in damages for the ceiling light fixture.

        {¶14} In its May 23, 2022 Judgment Entry, the trial court stated:



              [T]he Court has already found the defendant corporation to be liable

        for the damages caused by the delivery personnel who damaged the ceiling

        light and injured McQueen. In attempting to establish damages, the plaintiff

        sought to introduce documents and records pertaining to McQueen’s

        medical treatment. The Court and plaintiff’s counsel discussed the issues

        of admissibility as to hearsay considerations. The plaintiffs rely on Rule

        803(6) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and R.C. 3701.75 for the proposition

        that the medical records may be admitted into evidence and considered by

        the Court to determine damages.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                 6


             This reliance, however[,] is misplaced. While the rules of evidence

      allow for the admission of a record made of conditions at or near the time

      they occur, by a person with knowledge, which are kept in the regular

      course of a business, “the great weight of authority in Ohio holds that

      medical opinions and diagnoses are not within the hearsay exception of

      Ruld [sic] 803(6).” Williams v. Minute Men Select, Inc., 5th Dist. Tuscarawas

      Nos. 2016 AP 03 0016 and 2016 AP 04 0020, 2016-Ohio-7509, quoting

      Melton v. Gray, 5th Dist. Licking No. 15-CA-33, 2016-Ohio-194.

             The Fifth District Court of Appeals has applied a multipronged test to

      assess the admissibility of medical diagnoses and opinions through the

      “regularly kept records” exception to the hearsay rule.

             **

             Although Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 9-a and 9-b, the medical records of

      McQueen’s treatment and diagnosis, have a certification from an LMH

      employee that is notarized, the records do not meet all of the criteria

      required by the Court of Appeals to render them admissible. Of note, there

      is no indication that the diagnosis was made based on well-known and

      accepted objective testing and examining practices which are not of such a

      technical nature as to require cross-examination.

             As for authentication, the records are lacking as well.

             **

             The Court finds that the records do not qualify as an electronic health

      care record. Furthermore, the records in Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 9-a, 9-b, and 10
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                    7


      appear to contain electronic signatures of the health care professionals who

      treated McQueen. However, the plaintiffs have not introduced any evidence

      that the entity responsible for creating and maintaining the records have

      adopted a policy that permits the use of electronic signatures. Nor have

      they established that the policy meets all of the statutory requirements to

      permit authentication of the medical records offered.

             For the reason that the plaintiffs have not established that the records

      of McQueen’s medical diagnosis meet the requirements to qualify as an

      exception pursuant to Rule 803(6) or R.C. 3701.75, Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 9-a,

      9-b, 10, and 11 are stricken from the record.



      {¶15} May 23, 2022 Judgment Entry at 3-6.

      {¶16} It is well established “[a] defendant's failure to timely respond to a complaint

constitutes an admission the allegations in the complaint are true.” Bingham v. Slabach,

5th Dist. Stark Nos. 2008-CA-0085, 2008-CA-0086, 2008-Ohio-5555, ¶ 32, citing Sokol

v. Spigiel, 9th Dist. Lorain App. No. 05CA008839, 2006–Ohio–4408, ¶ 14. “Once a default

judgment has been entered, the only remaining triable issue is the amount of damages.”

Sokol, supra, citing Girard v. Leatherworks Partnership, 11th Dist. Trumbull App. No.

2004-T-0010, 2005-Ohio-4779, ¶ 38.

      {¶17} In their complaint, Appellants alleged “[a]s a direct and proximate result of

[Amazon’s] negligence, . . . McQueen . . . suffered serious bodily injury, which required

medical care and treatment.”     Complaint at ¶ 16.      When Amazon failed to file its

responsive pleading, it admitted all of the allegations set forth therein; therefore,
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                         8


Appellants were not required to present medical testimony or expert witness testimony to

establish causation.

       {¶18} “In conducting a hearing on damages, the trial court has broad discretion in

assessing the weight and credibility of the evidence of damages.” Skiver v. Wilson, 2018-

Ohio-3795, 119 N.E.3d 969, ¶ 18 (Citation omitted). A trial court is free to believe “all,

part, or none of the testimony of any witness who appeared before it,” and “the mere fact

that testimony is uncontroverted does not necessarily require a trier of fact to accept the

evidence if [it] found that the testimony was not credible.” Bradley v. Cage, 9th Dist.

Summit No. 20713, 2002-Ohio-816, *2 (Citations omitted). “The discretionary review of

the credibility of the witness is to be distinguished from a situation in which the trier of fact

expressly disregards the evidence by concluding that there was no evidence presented

to establish damages. 5500 S. Marginal Way, L.L.C. v. Parker, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.

110736, 2022-Ohio-1071, ¶ 14 (Citation omitted).

       {¶19} In this case, the trial court essentially concluded Appellants did not present

evidence to establish damages, noting:



              Calculating the amount of damages based on the evidence

       presented by the plaintiffs proves problematic based on a lack of specificity

       and documentation. For instance, McQueen testified that the first bill they

       received from LMH was for $7,000.00 or more. Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 8 reflects

       a bill for $6,223.50 but no foundation was laid for its authentication and

       McQueen testified when asked by the Court that she has not paid any out

       of pocket expenses for her medical treatment.              Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 7,
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                                        9


       moreover, is a collection of numerous statements which reflect no amounts

       due from the plaintiffs. She also failed to give a definite amount of money

       for lost wages as a result of being unable to return to her job for a week.

              Martinez’s testimony relating to damages for the ceiling light was

       vague and ambiguous. The exhibits clearly show that the plaintiffs are

       calculating their damages as to the light fixture based on internet searches.

       * * * [Martinez] gave a possible range of costs for the replacement and

       installation of the ceiling light. The Court simply cannot calculate damages

       without this specificity. * * *

              May 23, 2022 Judgment Entry at 6.



       {¶20} “R.C. 2317.421 makes the [medical] bills prima facie evidence of the

reasonable value of charges for medical services.” Robinson v. Bates, 112 Ohio St.3d 17,

2006-Ohio-6362, 857 N.E.2d 1195, ¶ 9. Additionally, “Ohio courts have found that, once

a right to damages has been established, that right cannot be denied because damages

are incapable of being calculated with mathematical certainty.” Brooks v. RKUK, Inc., 5th

Dist. Stark No. 2021CA00048, 2022-Ohio-266, 2022 WL 279013, ¶ 55 (Citation omitted).

       {¶21} Hearsay is admissible evidence unless the opposing party objects. It was

error for the trial court to exclude from its consideration Appellants’ evidence regarding

damages in the absence of an objection. Likewise, in the absence of an objection, the

evidence relative to the cost of replacing and installing the ceiling light fixture as testified

to by Martinez was sufficient to establish damages.
Licking County, Case No. 2022 CA 00039                                              10


       {¶22} Based upon the foregoing, we find the trial court’s award of $0 in damages

was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, this Court enters final

judgment in favor of Appellants and against Appellee in the amount of $6,618.50, plus

trial court costs.

       {¶23} Appellants’ sole assignment of error is sustained.

       {¶24} The judgment of the Licking County Municipal Court is reversed and final

judgment is entered.

                                 )
               EXPEDITED HEARING ORDER DENYING BENEFITS
       The Court held an expedited hearing on August 13, 2024. Mr. Meener requested
medical and temporary disability benefits for injuries to his neck, shoulder, low back, and
legs. Amazon argued that Mr. Meener did not provide proper notice. The Court agrees and
denies the requested benefits.
                                     History of Claim
       Mr. Meener testified that on April 22 and 23, 2023, he pushed 2,000-3,000 heavy
boxes that injured his back. On April 22, he went to the onsite clinic and received bio freeze
and a heat pack for back pain. Amazon created the workers’ compensation referral
notification, on June 23, that states he went to the clinic on April 22 “to self-treat chronic
back pain” and that he returned to work without incident.
       He testified he knew he had a work injury by April 23 and notified Amazon four
days later, on April 27, by taking a letter to the human resources desk. He spoke with
Anthony, who Mr. Meener described as a human resources manager. Another employee,
Melody, witnessed the conversation. Mr. Meener asked Anthony to give the letter to the
plant manager because his pain made walking difficult, and Anthony agreed.
       Mr. Meener also said that he could not deliver the letter to the plant manager because
he was parked in visitor parking. Additionally, a record of him “punching in” on April 27
shows he was in the building and thus, according to him, shows he delivered the letter on
that date.
       Amazon admitted his presence on April 27 but denied he reported the injury.
Brennan Reeves, the human resources manager, testified by declaration that Amazon has
an electronic system to log all associate engagements. He explained that neither Anthony
nor Melody logged that they were made aware of Mr. Meener’s injury in April 2023.
      Instead, Mr. Reeves stated that Amazon first learned of an injury allegation on June
23, when Mr. Meener completed and signed an “initial report form.”
       After he delivered the letter on April 27, Mr. Meener states he was told to call a
human resources number to report the injury. At one point he testified he called after his
second emergency room visit, on June 10, however, later he said he called the number “that
very night,” referring to April 27. He also said camera footage should have captured him
delivering the letter, but the camera was not working that day. Neither party provided proof
of the human resources call nor the camera allegations.
        In his May 30 petition, Mr. Meener alleged he notified Terrance with Amazon’s
onsite clinic on May 19, but he could not answer why he put May 19 as his notice date. He
testified that everything in the petition was correct, but he did not know the manager’s
name.
                           Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
        Mr. Meener has the burden of proving he is likely to prevail at a hearing on the
merits on his claim for medical and temporary benefits. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(c)(6)
(2023); McCord v. Advantage Human Resourcing, 2015 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS
6, at *7-8, 9 (Mar. 27, 2015).
        An employee must give written notice of a work-related injury within 15 days of
the work accident, unless the employee can show his employer had actual knowledge of
his injury or he had a reasonable excuse for not giving notice within 15 days. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-201(a)(1).
       In Ernstes v. Printpack, the Appeals Board instructed that trial courts evaluating the
issue of notice should consider the steps below:
       A. Did the employee provide timely written notice of the alleged work-
       related injury?
       B. If no timely written notice was provided, did the employer have “actual
       knowledge” of the alleged work-related accident or injury?
       C. If no timely written notice was provided and no actual knowledge has
       been proven, did the employee show a “reasonable excuse” for the failure to
       give proper notice to the employer?
       D. If the court determines that: (1) no timely written notice was provided;
       (2) the employer did not have actual knowledge of the alleged accident or
       injury; and (3) the employee did not prove a reasonable excuse for the failure
       to give timely notice, the claim should be denied and dismissed.
2023 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 25, at *34-35 (June 6, 2023).
        Here, Mr. Meener did not provide timely written notice within 15 days of his injury.
Although he claimed that he gave written and verbal notice on April 27, the Court does not
find his testimony credible nor consistent with the evidence. He completed, and signed, the
“initial incident form” on June 23. Also, he stated he gave notice on May 19 in his petition
for benefit determination. His testimony seemed defensive with no explanations for the
inconsistencies. See Kelly v. Kelly, 445 S.W.3d 685, 694-695 (Tenn. 2014) (discussing
indicia of witness credibility). Further, Amazon had no record of any conversation between
Anthony and Mr. Meener in their system.
       Next, the Court must determine whether Amazon had actual knowledge of the
alleged work-related injury. They did not. He went to the onsite clinic on the day of his
injury but said he needed treatment for his chronic back pain, not a work-related injury.
Additionally, as stated above, the Court did not find Mr. Meener’s testimony of verbal
notice on April 27 credible.
        The final question is whether Mr. Meener provided a reasonable excuse for his
failure to give timely notice. Mr. Meener did not argue reasonable excuse for his failure to
give timely notice, as he claimed he gave timely notice.
        The Court holds that Mr. Meener is unlikely to prevail at a hearing on the merits on
the issue of timely notice. His request for benefits is denied at this time.
   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows:
   1. Mr. Meener’s request for medical and temporary disability benefits is denied at this
      time.
   2. The Court sets a status conference for October 15, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. The parties
      must call (866) 943-0014 to participate. Failure to call might result in a
      determination of the issues without the party’s participation.
      ENTERED August 22, 2024.

                                          Right to Appeal:
      If you disagree with the Court’s Order, you may appeal to the Workers’ Compensation
Appeals Board. To do so, you must:
   1. Complete the enclosed form entitled “Notice of Appeal” and file it with the Clerk of the
      Court of Workers’ Compensation Claims before the expiration of the deadline.
               If the order being appealed is “expedited” (also called “interlocutory”), or if the
                 order does not dispose of the case in its entirety, the notice of appeal must be filed
                 within seven (7) business days of the date the order was filed.
               If the order being appealed is a “Compensation Order,” or if it resolves all issues
                 in the case, the notice of appeal must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of
                 the date the Compensation Order was filed.
      When filing the Notice of Appeal, you must serve a copy on the opposing party (or attorney,
      if represented).
   2. You must pay, via check, money order, or credit card, a $75.00 filing fee within ten calendar
      days after filing the Notice of Appeal. Payments can be made in-person at any Bureau office
      or by U.S. mail, hand-delivery, or other delivery service. In the alternative, you may file an
      Affidavit of Indigency (form available on the Bureau’s website or any Bureau office)
      seeking a waiver of the filing fee. You must file the fully-completed Affidavit of Indigency
      within ten calendar days of filing the Notice of Appeal. Failure to timely pay the filing
      fee or file the Affidavit of Indigency will result in dismissal of your appeal.
   3. You are responsible for ensuring a complete record is presented on appeal. If no court
      reporter was present at the hearing, you may request from the Court Clerk the audio
      recording of the hearing for a $25.00 fee. If you choose to submit a transcript as part of your
      appeal, which the Appeals Board has emphasized is important for a meaningful review of
      the case, a licensed court reporter must prepare the transcript, and you must file it with the
      Court Clerk. The Court Clerk will prepare the record for submission to the Appeals Board,

Before Richman, Graves, and Ramirez, Circuit Judges.
Irma Carrillo Ramirez, Circuit Judge:
       Amazon appeals the “constructive denial” of its motion for injunctive
relief from “being subjected to [two] unconstitutional administrative pro-
ceedings” before the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”). We DIS-
MISS this appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
                                      I
       Amazon is a major online retailer that receives, sorts, and ships
products from warehouses called “fulfillment centers.” In December 2021,
the Amazon Labor Union (“ALU”) filed a petition with the NLRB to
represent more than 8,000 Amazon employees at the fulfillment center in
Staten Island, New York. The election was held on April 1, 2022, and a
majority of the employees voted in favor of ALU. The election resulted in
two separate NLRB proceedings concerning the NLRB’s alleged
interference with the union election, Case 29-RC-288020 (the “Election
Case”), and Amazon’s alleged refusal to bargain with the union, Case 29-
CA-318069 (the “Bargaining Case”).
                                      A
       On April 8, 2022, Amazon initiated the Election Case by filing 25
objections, alleging that ALU and the Regional Office had interfered with the
conditions for a free and fair election. On March 31, 2022, the day before the
election, the NLRB’s Regional Director—with approval from the General
Counsel—sought an injunction ordering the immediate reinstatement of an
employee that Amazon had terminated almost two years earlier. That
employee had filed a charge against Amazon in June 2020, and the NLRB’s
Regional Office had issued a complaint against Amazon in December 2020.
Amazon claimed that the General Counsel should have sought an injunction
as soon as the Regional Office issued its complaint in December 2020, rather



                                      2

                                 No. 24-50761


than waiting until the eve of the union election. This “undermined the
integrity of the April 2022 election that the [NLRB] was obliged to supervise
neutrally.” Amazon sought to have the NLRB invalidate the election results
and order a second election.
       Amazon sought to transfer the case to a different, non-conflicted
region, and the General Counsel transferred the matter to Region 28, which
serves parts of Texas. On September 1, 2022, after a 24-day hearing, the
Region 28 Hearing Officer recommended that all of Amazon’s objections be
overruled. On January 11, 2023, the Region 28 Regional Director affirmed the
Hearing Officer’s recommendation and certified ALU as the bargaining
representative for Amazon’s Staten Island fulfillment center. On February 9,
2023, Amazon requested review of the decision, which the NLRB denied on
August 29, 2024.
                                       B
       Meanwhile, because of the election, ALU demanded that Amazon
recognize and bargain with it. It filed a charge with the Regional Office,
alleging that Amazon refused to recognize it or bargain with it as the exclusive
representative for the Staten Island employees. On July 12, 2023, the
Regional Director issued a complaint, which initiated the Bargaining Case.
       On August 23, 2023, the General Counsel moved for summary
judgment on the complaint, alleging that Amazon violated the National Labor
Relations Act by refusing to bargain with ALU until its objections were
adjudicated. The General Counsel also sought an order directing Amazon to
recognize and bargain with ALU, pay consequential damages as a “make-
whole” remedy for certain Amazon employees, and transfer the Bargaining
Case from the Regional Office to the NLRB itself.
       Later that day, the NLRB granted the motion to transfer and issued a
notice to show cause as to why the summary judgment motion should not be

                                  No. 24-50761


granted. On August 25, 2024, the day after the NLRB denied Amazon’s
request for review in the Election Case, the NLRB issued an updated notice
to show cause in the Bargaining Case. The updated notice instructed Amazon
to file any supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion on or
before September 13, 2024. The NLRB later extended the deadline to
September 27, 2024.
                                       C
       On September 5, 2024, Amazon sued the NLRB in the Western
District of Texas, requesting temporary, preliminary, and permanent
declaratory and injunctive relief. It sought:
       [T]o avoid serious and irreparable harm that it will otherwise
       suffer from being subjected to unconstitutional administrative
       proceedings. Because the structure of the proceedings in
       NLRB Cases 29-CA-310869 and 29-RC-288020 violate the
       United States Constitution under Supreme Court and Fifth
       Circuit precedent, Amazon respectfully brings this action for
       declaratory and injunctive relief . . . .
Amazon also requested that the district court “set a hearing for a preliminary
injunction [and] issue a preliminary injunction” but did not request that this
hearing—or the requested relief—occur before a specific date.
       After it filed suit, Amazon asked the NLRB to administratively stay
the Bargaining Case proceeding, but the NLRB refused. On September 9,
2024, the district court informed Amazon that a local rule required that its
application for a preliminary injunction must be made in a separate motion.
Accordingly, on September 10, 2024, Amazon moved for a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction. Amazon argued that it faced
imminent and irreparable harm because, if the administrative proceedings
went forward, “Amazon will lose its right not to undergo an unconstitutional
proceeding.” Judicial review of its constitutional claims “would thus come




                                       4
Case: 24-50761       Document: 172-1      Page: 5    Date Filed: 05/06/2025




                                 No. 24-50761


too late to be meaningful.” See Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 202
(2023). Amazon informed the district court that the original deadline to file
its supplemental opposition was September 13, but again, it did not request
expedited relief from the district court. That same day, the NLRB moved to
transfer the case to the Eastern District of New York.
       The district court held a hearing on the motions to transfer and for
temporary restraining order on September 24, 2024. At the hearing, Amazon
acknowledged both that it had not filed its response in the Bargaining Case
and that the NLRB “normally [takes] weeks” to issue a decision. It
expressed its concern that “a ruling could issue as soon as we file a brief”
because of the “relationship between [Amazon] and the NLRB.” Amazon
also told the district court that “if the [Bargaining Case proceeding] goes
forward after this Friday and [the NLRB] issues an order granting the
summary judgment, then the constitutional issues . . . are mooted.” The
NLRB, in turn, represented that “a period of months, generally, is about as
quick as the board can act given its caseload.” Amazon did not request an
expedited ruling or a ruling by its submission deadline, September 27. The
district court requested supplemental briefing by September 27 and took both
motions under advisement.
       On September 26, 2024, Amazon filed a letter brief with the district
court “ahead of the 12:00 p.m. Central, September 27, 2024, deadline” to
file its supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion pending
before the NLRB. In the district court, it re-urged its motion for injunctive
relief and stated that it would be seeking emergency appellate relief unless
the district court granted a temporary restraining order before its submission
deadline, alleging that it would be “forced” to do so “given the imminence
of a Board ruling in the underlying administrative proceeding.” In response,
the NLRB argued that Amazon had not established any of the necessary
elements for an emergency temporary restraining order. The next day,

                                      No. 24-50761


Amazon noticed the appeal of the district court’s “constructive denial” of
its motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
       While the current appeal was pending before this court, on September
29, 2024, the district court granted—but stayed—the NLRB’s motion to
transfer. 1 It also denied Amazon’s request for a temporary restraining order.
The district court explained that “Amazon has failed to establish a
substantial threat of irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted.”
Instead, “it predicates its claim based on a claim that the NLRB may depart
from precedent and require it to provide some form of compensation to
employees for their lost opportunity to engage in collective bargaining.”
“This is both speculative and unripe,” the district court found.
       On September 30, 2024, a motions panel of this court administratively
stayed the proceedings before the district court and the NLRB and expedited
the matter to the next available merits panel.
                                            II
       At issue is whether the district court constructively denied Amazon’s
motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
       Under § 1292(a)(1), this court has jurisdiction to review interlocutory
orders, including orders that refuse or dissolve injunctions. 28 U.S.C. §
1292(a)(1). This also includes orders that do not expressly refuse an
injunction but have the “practical effect of doing so.” Carson v. Am. Brands,
Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83 (1981) (citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co.,
287 U.S. 430, 433 (1932)).


       _____________________
       1
         In its opening brief, Amazon contends that “[t]he district court lacked
       jurisdiction to enter the order, and it has no effect on the appeal before the

                                      III
       Amazon argues that the district court constructively denied its motion
for a preliminary injunction by failing to rule on or before September 27,
2024; as a result, it faced an injury that could not be undone—the NLRB
“consummating a final order in its unconstitutional proceeding.” We
disagree.
       “[W]hat counts as an effective denial is contextual—different cases
require rulings on different timetables.” In re Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce, 100 F.4th 528, 535 (5th Cir. 2024). “District courts have wide
discretion in managing their docket, and they do not necessarily deny a
motion by failing to rule on a parties’ requested timeline.” Id. “Appeal
cannot be achieved simply by asserting that the trial court has failed to act
promptly as wished by a party seeking an injunction.” Id. “There must be a
legitimate basis for [any] urgency.” Id. (citing 16 Charles Allen
Wright & Arthur Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure
§ 3924.1 (3d ed.)). Another consideration is the litigant’s “diligence in
seeking to expedite briefing and consideration,” such as whether it has made
“repeated requests for a ruling by a specific date.” Id.
       In Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, a group of business associations
sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, challenging a new rule that
required them to print and distribute materials about credit card late fees to
customers and provide notice of mitigating changes by March 29, 2024. 
100F.4th at 531. On March 7, the associations moved to enjoin the rule and
specifically requested an expedited ruling “within 10 days, or as soon as
possible thereafter, to prevent irrecoverable harm.” Id. at 531–32. The
district court did not rule within 10 days and instead sua sponte requested
briefing on venue on March 18. Id. The next day, the associations again
specifically requested an expedited ruling and informed the court that they

                                 No. 24-50761


would understand the preliminary injunction to have effectively been denied
if it had not ruled by March 22. Id. Without ruling on the motion, the district
court transferred the case to the District of Columbia on March 28. Id. We
held that the district court had effectively denied the motion for preliminary
injunction because the associations demonstrated a legitimate basis for the
urgency, i.e., “the unusually short timeline for complying with the rule.” 
Id.at 535. They had also “repeatedly requested swift review,” including
“repeated requests for a ruling by specific dates.” Id. at 534.
                                      A
       We first consider Amazon’s diligence in seeking expedited briefing
and consideration. Id. at 535.
       Here, Amazon did not “[make it] clear from its first filing [on
September 5, 2024] that the [final order] was going into effect on an
unusually short timeline.” 100 F.4th at 534. It instead “made clear” that the
deadline to respond to the NLRB’s summary judgment motion was
September 13—and then later September 27—and that a final order could be
anticipated at some point after that deadline. Amazon even acknowledged
that the NLRB “normally [takes] weeks” to issue a decision.
       Moreover, unlike the business associations in Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce, Amazon did not “repeatedly request[] swift review.” 
100 F.4th at534. Amazon “specifically requested a ruling” just once, approximately 24
hours before the September 27 deadline, despite several prior opportunities.
See id. Amazon never made a specific request for an expedited briefing
schedule, an expedited hearing, or an expedited ruling in its filings. Amazon
emphasized in the hearing that it faced imminent and irreparable harm if the
NLRB issued an order granting summary judgment. But despite telling the
court that “a ruling could issue as soon as we file a brief,” Amazon never

                                        No. 24-50761


made a specific request during the hearing for an expedited ruling—or even
just a ruling—by September 27.
       Indeed, Amazon failed to make this request even when specifically
asked for input about next steps and timing. Towards the end of the hearing,
the district judge expressed concern that, if he granted the motion to transfer,
Amazon could appeal his order, and “then we [would] just be back here with
more delay.” He point-blank asked, “[s]o what do I do here, Amazon?”
Despite this prompting, Amazon still made no specific request for a ruling by
September 27. 2 Moreover, before concluding the hearing, the district judge
said that he would allow the parties to file supplemental briefs by September
27. Even when presented with a supplemental briefing deadline that fell on
the date it purportedly needed a decision by, Amazon again failed to inform
the district court of its needs. Amazon did not object or otherwise state the
importance of an expedited decision; instead, it asked the district court
whether it wanted the briefing “by a particular time.” Amazon did not
request relief by a specific date—or even expedited relief—until its letter
brief dated September 26, in which it requested for the first time that the
district court rule on or before September 27. During oral argument, Amazon
was also unable to identify any other specific request for a ruling by this date.
Amazon has not shown that it acted diligently.

           In response to the district court’s question, counsel stated:
       So, I guess a few options. One would be to grant the TRO to give yourself,
       Your Honor, time to write and issue an order. But I think if you’re saying
       your inclination is to transfer venue, which would result in you staying the
       case for an appeal, I think a TRO or preliminary injunction does need to
       be granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the
       underlying case. Because if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an
       order granting the summary judgment, then the constitutional issues again
       are mooted.

       Amazon also failed to establish a legitimate basis for the alleged
urgency. See Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. September
27 was Amazon’s deadline to file its response to the summary judgment
motion in the Bargaining Case. Nothing indicated that the NLRB would—
or even could—issue a decision that same day. Amazon acknowledged at the
preliminary injunction hearing that it normally takes weeks for decisions to
issue; the NLRB stated that “a period of months, generally, is about as quick
as [it] can act given its caseload.”
       Finally, this court has also considered the district court’s timeliness
in assessing urgency. Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535(“[G]iven the issuers’ unusually short timeline for complying with the Final
Rule or obtaining injunctive relief, the district court effectively denied the
Chambers’ motion for a preliminary injunction by not promptly ruling on it and
instead opting to hear an unrelated motion sua sponte.” Id. (emphasis
added)). See, e.g., United States v. Lynd, 301 F.2d 818, 823 (5th Cir. 1962)
(finding effective denial where the district court conducted a merits hearing
on the injunction motion and the movant “proved without question” its
entitlement to relief, but the district court unduly delayed ruling on that
motion). Here, the district court issued its decision one business day after
supplemental briefing was complete, but by that point, Amazon had already
petitioned this court for relief.
       A litigant cannot “simply say they need an expedited ruling and then
appeal by claiming effective denial when they do not get it on their preferred
timeline.” Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, 100 F.4th at 535. Amazon
neither diligently requested consideration by September 27 nor
demonstrated a legitimate basis for the urgency. The district court did not
effectively deny the motion for injunctive relief in failing to rule on or before

decision before this court under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1). This appeal must be
dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Priscilla Richman, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
       I would hold that the district court effectively denied Amazon’s
motion for a preliminary injunction, giving rise to our interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction. Because the court concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.
                                              I
       Under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), we have jurisdiction over appeals from
interlocutory orders denying injunctive relief. 1 Litigants may also, in certain
circumstances, appeal an otherwise unappealable interlocutory order that
does “not in terms ‘refus[e]’ an ‘injunctio[n],’” but nonetheless has “the
practical effect of doing so.” 2 We have also “recognized that simply sitting
on a preliminary-injunction motion for too long can effectively deny it.” 3 In
constructive-denial cases, we require a showing that the practical or effective
denial “threatens ‘serious, perhaps irreparable[,] consequences’ and can be
effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.” 4 This showing serves as
“a safeguard against undue widening of the floodgates which currently keep

       We recently discussed how to “determine whether the district court’s
inaction . . . amounts to an ‘effective’ denial” in In re Fort Worth Chamber of
Commerce. 6 There, the plaintiff filed suit challenging a new administrative
rule two days after the agency finalized the rule. 7 The new rule required the
plaintiff to take steps toward compliance twenty-two days later. 8 The
plaintiff immediately moved for a preliminary injunction, expressly
requesting a ruling within ten days. 9 The district court did not rule within
ten days; instead, on the eleventh day, the court “sua sponte requested
briefing on venue.” 10 On the twelfth day, the plaintiff moved for expedited
review of its preliminary injunction motion and informed the court that if “it
did not receive a ruling by [the fifteenth day], it would understand its
preliminary injunction to be effectively denied and would accordingly seek
appellate review.” 11 The district court did not rule by the fifteenth day. 12 On

the eighteenth day—four days before the date for compliance—the plaintiff
appealed. 13
       We concluded that the district court had effectively denied the
plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction such that we had interlocutory
appellate jurisdiction. We reasoned that “a motion for preliminary injunctive
relief ‘must be granted promptly to be effective.’” 14 Accordingly, “[a]mong
the considerations when determining whether a district court has waited too
long to rule on a motion is ‘the urgency of preliminary relief as a means of
preserving the opportunity for effective permanent relief.’” 15 In this vein,
“[t]here must be a legitimate basis for the urgency.” 16 “Thus, whether a
district court fails to act promptly depends entirely on context.” 17 We also
emphasized that “[f]or its part,” the moving party “acted diligently.” 18
       In Fort Worth, the plaintiff had a legitimate basis for urgency because
“the Final Rule’s fast-closing window for compliance demanded faster
review of the motion for a preliminary injunction.” 19 The plaintiff acted
diligently by filing suit within two days after the agency finalized the rule; by
“ma[king] clear from its first filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short

window of time to comply” with the new rule; by specifically requesting a
ruling on its preliminary injunction motion within ten days; by making
“repeated requests for a ruling by specific dates”; and by requesting
expedited briefing. 20 Yet the district court failed to rule on the preliminary
injunction motion, but instead “g[a]ve its attention to” the venue issue. 21
This amounted to an effective denial of the motion for a preliminary
injunction.
                                        III
       These principles support appellate jurisdiction here. While some of
the operative facts differ in degree, “what counts as an effective denial is
contextual.” 22

       Amazon had a legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary
injunctive relief against the Bargaining Case. Impending summary judgment
in the Bargaining Case could moot Amazon’s district court claims,
precluding the district court’s ability to grant any relief. I am persuaded that
this would be “a ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence’” that “can be
‘effectually challenged’ only by immediate appeal” from the district court’s
effective denial of Amazon’s motion. 23
       Amazon’s constitutional objections to the Bargaining Case all allege
ongoing subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker. While “[t]hat harm may

sound a bit abstract,” the Supreme Court “has made clear that it is ‘a here-
and-now injury’” that district courts have jurisdiction to redress prior to the
termination of an agency proceeding. 24 This injury is conceptually distinct
from an injury arising from an adverse agency order, which a party might
challenge—also on constitutional grounds—after the proceeding. 25
Importantly, the here-and-now injury “is impossible to remedy once the
proceeding is over” because “[a] proceeding that has already happened
cannot be undone.” 26
       Amazon and the NLRB agree that the Board could grant summary
judgment against Amazon after the September 27 show-cause deadline,
including on that same day, 27 and the NLRB acknowledged in oral
arguments that “the administrative proceeding would likely have concluded
at that point had the Board addressed all issues in the case.” 28 In that event,
the “proceeding is over,” and it “cannot be undone.” 29 Post hoc “[j]udicial
review of [Amazon’s] structural constitutional claims”—framed as ongoing
subjection to an illegitimate decisionmaker—“would come too late to be
meaningful,” 30 and the district court would be unable to provide the relief

Amazon requested in its complaint. That is exactly why “preliminary relief
[functions] as a means of preserving the opportunity for effective permanent
relief.” 31 Just as in Fort Worth a “fast-closing window for compliance
demanded faster review of the motion for a preliminary injunction,” a fast-
closing window before potential summary judgment in the Bargaining Case
demanded faster review here. 32
       The majority opinion concludes that there was no legitimate basis for
Amazon’s urgency because there was no indication that the Board would
issue a decision on the same day as the show-cause deadline. 33 To be sure,
the parties dispute how quickly the Board would likely act after the show-
cause deadline, and there is admittedly no guarantee that the Board would
grant summary judgment against Amazon, thus ending the proceedings. But
the prospect that the Board could issue an adverse decision any time after the
show-cause deadline, as the parties agree was possible, presented a legitimate
basis for urgency. In reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority opinion
states that “Amazon acknowledged at the preliminary injunction hearing that
it normally takes weeks for decisions to issue.” 34 In context, however,
Amazon’s “acknowledgement” is far from any concession. The district
court asked, “[H]ow fast do you think the Board is going to issue a decision?”
Amazon responded:
       This would certainly be a guess, although an educated one; but,
       typically, in test of certification proceedings the rulings come
       out fairly quickly, much quicker than in the normal course.

        [The court then stated: “Give me timeframes.”] Normally
        weeks, but given the posture of this case and sort of the nature
        of the—what I’ll call the relationship between our client and
        the NLRB, we believe that a ruling could issue as soon as we
        file a brief. 35
Even if Amazon acknowledged that it “normally” takes weeks for decisions
to issue, Amazon argued that the NLRB would likely act faster than usual in
its case. Further, we cannot consider the fact that the Board has yet to render
a decision because a motions panel of this court administratively stayed the
Bargaining Case on September 30, preventing the Board from acting.
        Similarly, although the district judge stated during the September 24
motions hearing that he intended “to try to get this [ruling on the motions]
out as soon as I can,” Amazon could not know how long the court would take,
or if the Board would grant summary judgment before the court could act.
Even though we now know that the district court issued a ruling on Amazon’s
request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) two days after Amazon
noticed its appeal, we must consider the context as it existed on September
27—the date on which Amazon had to file its response at the NLRB, thus
making ripe the General Counsel’s motion for summary judgment—not
September 29. On September 27, neither the district court nor Amazon
could know how long the Board would wait to issue a decision in the
Bargaining Case—two days, two weeks, two months, or longer. Accordingly,
I give little weight to the fact that the district court ruled on the motion two
days later. 36
        Importantly, I do not see—and the majority opinion has not offered—
any principled way for us to determine whether the district court failed to

“timely rule on [Amazon’s] preliminary-injunction motion” 37 other than by
tethering that inquiry to the show-cause deadline. Assume Amazon had not
noticed its appeal on September 27 and assume the district court did not
eventually act on September 29. How long after the show-cause deadline
would have been too long of a delay by the district court? At what point could
Amazon have invoked our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction on an effective-
denial theory? After the show-cause deadline arrived, no one could know,
other than the NLRB, when the Board intended to issue a decision that could
moot Amazon’s district court claims. What was certain was that the Board
could issue a ruling after the show-cause deadline, at its convenience.
       Amazon’s basis for urgency was all the more legitimate given that the
Board had the power to moot Amazon’s claims against the NLRB. To moot
those claims, the Board only had to render an adverse order quickly against
Amazon disposing of all the issues in the Bargaining Case. It is notable that
the Board apparently declined requests to defer its proceedings. According
to Amazon, “[i]mmediately after filing suit, [it] asked the Board to
administratively stay the [Bargaining Case],” but “[t]he Board refused.”
Only after the district court on September 10 scheduled the motions hearing
for September 24 did the Board on September 11 extend the initial show-
cause deadline to September 27—thus setting the deadline after the district
court’s hearing on both Amazon’s motion and the NLRB’s motion to transfer.
Amazon represented to the district court after the motions hearing that it
“again requested” that the Board stay the Bargaining Case, but the “Board
[was] unwilling to do so.” Even the district court at the motions hearing
asked the NLRB why it was not “just agreeing to stay a decision until all this
is handled.” The NLRB responded: “Because the agency obviously has an

interest in continuing its orderly processes.” But that is exactly the point:
the Board’s continuing its orderly processes, which no doubt is a legitimate
interest, could moot Amazon’s district court claims. That potential outcome
provided Amazon’s legitimate basis for urgency in seeking preliminary relief.
                                        B
       The moving party also must act diligently. While Amazon was
arguably less diligent here than the moving party in Fort Worth, Amazon’s
efforts in this context were sufficient.
       Amazon filed suit on September 5—just six days after the Board
issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case—seeking
declaratory and permanent injunctive relief. Although the Bargaining Case
had begun a little more than a year prior, there was minimal action in the
Bargaining Case while the related Election Case proceeded; in fact, Amazon
had argued in response to the Board’s first notice to show cause that the
Board could not resolve issues in the Bargaining Case until it completed the
Election Case. The Board denied review of the Election Case on August 29,
2024, and issued its second notice to show cause in the Bargaining Case on
August 30. Amazon had little reason to challenge the effectively paused
Bargaining Case until the Election Case ended, and Amazon promptly sued
once it did.
       Amazon’s complaint also requested a TRO and a preliminary
injunction against the Bargaining Case. The complaint did more than merely
make clear “that the deadline to respond to the NLRB’s summary-judgment
motion was September 13.” 38 Rather, Amazon emphasized that its “need for
a temporary restraining order is imminent and dire because the NLRB may

issue an order in [the Bargaining Case] any time on or after September 13,
2024.” Amazon also requested that the court “set a hearing for a preliminary
injunction, and, after a properly noticed hearing, issue a preliminary
injunction.”
       On September 9, the court advised Amazon that a local rule required
submitting an application for temporary or preliminary relief in a separate
motion. Amazon filed its motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction on
September 10. Amazon’s motion reiterated the urgency it had raised in its
complaint, emphasizing that “Amazon must file any supplemental
opposition to the original Notice to Show Cause on or before Friday,
September 13, 2024” (bold, italics, and underline in original). 39
       Both the September 5 complaint and September 10 motion made clear
that Amazon’s show-cause deadline was (initially) September 13, after which
the Board would be poised to issue a ruling on the General Counsel’s
summary judgment motion, potentially mooting Amazon’s district court
claims. Amazon repeatedly emphasized the (postponed) September 27
show-cause deadline at the September 24 motions hearing, even stating at
one point that it “want[ed] the TRO today.” 40 At the end of the hearing,
Amazon represented that “a TRO or preliminary injunction does need to be
granted to, again, stop the NLRB from issuing an order in the” Bargaining
Case “[b]ecause if it goes forward after this Friday and issues an order
granting the summary judgment [motion], then the constitutional issues
again are mooted.” 41 Finally, Amazon’s September 26 letter brief told the

district court that Amazon would consider its motion effectively denied on
September 27. 42
       In my view, these facts show that Amazon “made clear from its first
filing that . . . [it] had an unusually short window of time” before it needed
injunctive relief, which it “repeated” multiple times. 43 I accept that Amazon
failed until September 26 to state expressly that it would consider its motion
“effectively denied” when the show-cause deadline arrived on September
27. But it was indisputably clear from the earlier filings that Amazon, if it
were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, needed a ruling before the
show-cause deadline, after which the Board’s action could leave Amazon’s
alleged injury “impossible to remedy.” 44 The NLRB argues that Amazon
tried “to impose a decisional deadline with barely one day’s notice.” Yet
even the district court commented at the motions hearing that Amazon was
“asking [it] to make a major decision on two weeks’ notice.” Given this
statement by the district court, I cannot agree with the majority opinion’s
conclusion that Amazon “failed to inform the district court of its need[]” for
a ruling by the show-cause deadline until just one day before that deadline. 45
       Ironically, whatever doubt there might have been from Amazon’s
failure to repeat some apparently talismanic phrase earlier, the NLRB’s
September 10 transfer motion made clear that “Amazon can claim that its
motion for injunctive relief has been ‘effectively denied,’ . . . [on] Friday,
September 13,” 46 which was the then-operative show-cause deadline. While

the NLRB’s brief in this court characterizes this concession as a suspicion
“that Amazon might seek to manufacture an effective-denial argument,” the
concession at the very least makes clear that the parties and district court
understood by September 10 that Amazon was seeking relief before the
Board-imposed show-cause deadline.
       The majority opinion faults Amazon for failing to object at the motions
hearing when the district court set the supplemental briefing deadline at noon
on September 27. 47 I do not believe this means Amazon failed to act
diligently. Amazon had repeatedly made clear—including, by my count, five
times earlier during that very hearing—that it needed relief by the show-
cause deadline. 48 Our decision in Fort Worth does not require that Amazon
have repeated its need for relief yet again.
       I do not mean to criticize the district court. “District courts have wide
discretion in managing their docket,” and “plaintiffs cannot simply say they
need an expedited ruling and then appeal by claiming effective denial when
they don’t get it on their preferred timeline.” 49 Amazon asked the court to
consider complex constitutional issues on an accelerated timeline, which no
doubt placed great pressure on the court. Notably, unlike in Fort Worth—

where the district judge sua sponte directed his attention to another matter
entirely—the judge here took some action on Amazon’s motion by
scheduling a hearing and eventually denying the TRO after Amazon
appealed. We have declined jurisdiction where the district court has done far
less because “mere inaction is not an order refusing injunctive relief, and is
not appealable.” 50         But at bottom, there was limited time in which
preliminary relief could preserve the district court’s ability to grant
meaningful permanent relief, assuming Amazon was entitled to either. Given
that legitimate basis for urgency, as well as Amazon’s relative diligence
pursuing its precise claims and the uncertainty as to what would transpire
(and when) after the show-cause deadline, I believe the principles in Fort
Worth support interlocutory appellate jurisdiction here.
                                      *        *         *
       For these reasons, I would exercise interlocutory appellate
jurisdiction to reach the merits of Amazon’s appeal. Because the court
instead dismisses the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, I respectfully dissent.

                    Defendants-Appellees.



          On Appeal from a Judgment of the United States
         District Court for the Eastern District of New York.



                       ARGUED: MAY 19, 2021
                     DECIDED: OCTOBER 18, 2022

         Before: JACOBS, CHIN, and NARDINI, Circuit Judges.



      This case involves claims brought by workers at Amazon’s
JFK8 fulfillment center and members of the workers’ households in
connection with the COVID-19 policies, practices, and procedures at
JFK8. In their amended complaint Plaintiffs allege causes of action for
public nuisance, breach of the duty to protect the health and safety of
employees under New York Labor Law (“NYLL”) § 200, violation of
NYLL § 191 for failure to pay, on time and in full, COVID-19 sick leave
under New York’s COVID-19 sick leave law, and injunctive relief
against future violations of NYLL § 191. The United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York (Brian M. Cogan, Judge)
dismissed Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, relying on the doctrine of
primary jurisdiction, as well as alternative grounds, to dispose of the
public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims, and dismissing Plaintiffs’
§ 191 claim for failure to state a claim for relief based on COVID-19
sick leave payments not falling within § 191’s definition of “wages.”
Plaintiffs now appeal. First, we reject Amazon’s contention that we
should partially dismiss this appeal as moot. Second, we agree with
Plaintiffs that the district court wrongly applied the primary
jurisdiction doctrine to their public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims.
Ultimately, however, only their § 200 claim survives. Accordingly,
we hold: (1) Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are not
moot; (2) the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply to
Plaintiffs’ public nuisance or NYLL § 200 claims; (3) Plaintiffs fail to
state a claim for public nuisance under New York law because they
do not allege a special injury; (4) Section 11 of the New York Workers’
Compensation Law does not preclude injunctive relief under NYLL
§ 200; and (5) COVID-19 sick leave payments are not “wages” under
NYLL § 191. We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of
Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 191 claims; and we VACATE
the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim and
REMAND to the district court for further proceedings on that claim.

opinion.

WILLIAM J. NARDINI, Circuit Judge:

      Workers at Amazon’s JFK8 fulfillment center and members of

their households (together, “Plaintiffs”) challenge workplace COVID-

19 policies, practices, and procedures at JFK8. Their suit against

Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC (together,

“Amazon”) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District

of New York (Brian M. Cogan, Judge) asserts causes of action under




                                     3
New York law for public nuisance, breach of the duty to protect the

health and safety of employees under New York Labor Law

(“NYLL”) § 200, violation of NYLL § 191 for failure to pay, on time

and in full, COVID-19 sick leave under New York’s COVID-19 sick

leave law, and injunctive relief against future violations of NYLL

§ 191. Amazon moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint. In

a memorandum decision and order filed on November 2, 2020, the

district court granted Amazon’s motion. On November 3, 2020, the

district court entered judgment dismissing Plaintiffs’ amended

complaint.

      The district court dismissed Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and

NYLL § 200 claims without prejudice under the primary jurisdiction

doctrine, concluding that the questions before the court turned on

factual issues requiring the technical and policy expertise of the

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). In the

alternative, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to allege




                                    4
the special injury required to state a claim for public nuisance; that

New York’s Workers’ Compensation Law preempts suit under NYLL

§ 200 for injunctive relief for past harm; and that Plaintiffs failed to

allege a cognizable injury under NYLL § 200 based on the threat of

future harm.    The district court then dismissed with prejudice

Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 191 claims, concluding that COVID-19 leave

payments are not “wages” as defined by § 191.

      Plaintiffs now appeal the district court’s dismissal. This appeal

presents five key questions: (1) whether Plaintiffs’ public nuisance

and NYLL § 200 claims are moot because they are premised on New

York Forward, a state-issued plan with industry-specific guidance for

businesses that has since been rescinded; (2) whether the district court

correctly applied the primary jurisdiction doctrine in dismissing

Plaintiffs’ state law claims in deference to OSHA; (3) whether

Plaintiffs plausibly plead a special injury to support a public nuisance

claim against Amazon; (4) whether the New York Workers’




                                   5
Compensation Law bars claims for injunctive relief under NYLL

§ 200; and (5) whether NYLL § 191 establishes how and when COVID-

19 sick leave pay must be paid.

      First, we hold that Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200

claims are not moot.      These claims continue to present a live

controversy because they are not based solely on since-rescinded

guidance associated with the New York Forward plan. Second, we

hold that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply to

Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims. The issues before

us—whether Amazon created a public nuisance and whether

Amazon has breached its duty owed to Plaintiffs under NYLL § 200—

turn on questions of state tort law that are within the conventional

experience of judges.     Although it is certainly within OSHA’s

competence to evaluate and create workplace health and safety

standards, OSHA’s expertise would not be a material aid here; the

issues before us are of a legal, not factual, nature and do not require




                                  6
the kind of highly factual inquiry that would typically be aided by

OSHA’s expertise. Furthermore, OSHA has not promulgated the

kind of cross-industry COVID-19 workplace safety standards that

might be applicable here. Third, we hold that although Plaintiffs may

plead a harm that is different in degree from the community at large,

they fail to plead a harm that is different in kind, thereby failing to

allege the special injury required to state a claim for public nuisance

under New York law. Fourth, we hold that New York’s Workers’

Compensation Law is concerned only with claims for monetary relief

and leaves open claims against employers for injunctive relief under

NYLL § 200. Lastly, we hold that NYLL § 191 determines the pay

frequency for “wages” but not “benefits or supplemental wages.”

Because COVID-19 leave payments are not “wages” as defined by

NYLL § 191, Plaintiffs do not have a private cause of action under

§ 191 for Amazon’s alleged failure to comply with New York’s

COVID-19 sick leave law.




                                  7
         Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of

Plaintiffs’ public nuisance claim and NYLL § 191 claims for damages

and injunctive relief; and we VACATE the district court’s dismissal of

Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim seeking a declaratory judgment and

injunctive relief and REMAND to the district court for further

proceedings on this claim.

I.       Background

         We assume the following facts, which are taken from Plaintiffs’

amended complaint, to be true for the purposes of this appeal.

Kolbasyuk v. Cap. Mgmt. Servs., LP, 918 F.3d 236, 238 n.1, 239 (2d Cir.

2019).

         A.    Amazon’s Operations at JFK8

         The JFK8 fulfillment center (“JFK8”) is a facility operated by

Amazon in Staten Island, New York. JFK8 covers approximately

840,000 square feet and runs twenty-four hours per day, seven days

per week. On average, JFK8 employs 3,500 workers at any given time.




                                    8
During peak seasons—the period around Amazon Prime Day in July

and the months leading up to Christmas—the workforce expands to

approximately 5,000. During the course of the pandemic, Amazon’s

national workforce expanded. As of April 2020, Amazon had hired

175,000 more workers to account for increased demand for online

shopping and product delivery.

      Amazon tracks its employees’ activity through devices workers

use to scan items and packages. It uses this information to determine

whether employees are on task and to calculate an employee’s total

time off task (“TOT”) for each shift. An employee’s TOT in a shift is

not to exceed thirty minutes. TOT greater than thirty minutes results

in a written warning; TOT greater than sixty minutes results in a final

written warning; and TOT greater than 120 minutes results in an

automatic termination.       Employees accumulate TOT during

bathroom breaks. An employee’s supervisor must re-code certain

TOT activities to prevent them from contributing to an employee’s




                                  9
total TOT. Supervisors cannot re-code TOT for bathroom breaks, but

they can decide whether to discipline an employee for exceeding TOT

limits because of those breaks.

      B.    New York’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic

      On March 1, 2020, New York announced its first confirmed case

of COVID-19. On March 20, 2020, then-New York Governor Andrew

Cuomo issued the New York State on PAUSE Executive Order. Exec.

Order No. 202.6 (N.Y. Mar. 22, 2020). The Order permitted essential

businesses—those providing products or services required to

maintain the health, safety, and welfare of New Yorkers—to remain

open. Amazon was deemed an essential business.

      In May 2020, New York began a phased reopening of non-

essential businesses under the New York Forward plan. The plan

provided detailed, industry-specific guidance for essential businesses

and non-essential businesses that were permitted to reopen. The

guidance outlined “minimum requirements” businesses needed to




                                  10
follow to remain open. JFK8 was subject to the New York Forward

Interim Guidance for the Wholesale Trade Sector.

      In parallel to the Governor’s executive action, on March 18,

2020, the New York legislature responded to the pandemic by

enacting a COVID-19 sick leave law (the “Leave Law”). See 2020 N.Y.

Sess. Laws ch. 25 (McKinney). The Leave Law requires employers to

pay sick leave to employees who are “subject to a mandatory or

precautionary order of quarantine or isolation issued by the state of

New York, the department of health, local board of health, or any

governmental entity duly authorized to issue such order to COVID-

19.” Id. § 1.1(a). The amount of sick leave an employer must provide

varies based on its number of employees.         Employers with a

workforce of one hundred or more must give at least fourteen days of

paid sick leave during any mandatory or precautionary order of

quarantine or isolation. Id. § 1.1(c).




                                    11
      C.    Plaintiffs’ allegations

      Plaintiffs are warehouse workers at JFK8 and members of the

employees’ households. The employee plaintiffs are Derrick Palmer,

Benita Rouse, Barbara Chandler, and Deasahni Bernard. Their roles

all involve working close to other team members, and most of their

roles include touching items that other workers have handled. The

remaining plaintiffs (together, the “Non-Employee Plaintiffs”) live in

the households of the employee plaintiffs: Kendia Mesidor is in a

relationship with Derrick Palmer, and Alexander Rouse and Luis

Pellot-Chandler are the children of Benita Rouse and Barbara

Chandler, respectively. Chandler and Bernard contracted COVID-19

while employed at JFK8.        Members of Chandler’s household

experienced symptoms of COVID-19, including her cousin who died

in April 2020.

      As the pandemic hit New York in spring 2020, Plaintiffs became

concerned that Amazon was disregarding federal and state




                                 12
guidance—namely, the New York Forward plan, the Leave Law, and

guidance from the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention (“CDC”)—and thereby creating an unsafe workplace

during a global pandemic.

      Plaintiffs allege that Amazon deters workers from social

distancing, washing hands, and disinfecting workstations. Plaintiffs

point to a primary root cause: TOT requirements. Although Amazon

purportedly suspended TOT tracking requirements and productivity

feedback in March 2020, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon did not inform

workers of this change until an announcement on July 13, 2020.

According to Plaintiffs, even after Amazon’s July announcement,

managers continued to post TOT rate goals around the JFK8 facility

and to encourage workers to meet those goals. Plaintiffs assert that

Amazon’s mixed messages and lack of communication concerning

TOT and rate policies discourage workers from leaving their

workstations to wash their hands and from taking time to disinfect




                                13
their work area. Although workers in some departments can re-code

their time to indicate that they are “off task” to address a dangerous

condition, equipment malfunction, or injury, Amazon does not

provide the same re-coding mechanism for employees breaking to

wash hands, social distance, or sanitize workstations.

      Next, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon failed to implement any

policy regarding social distancing. Only two of the breakrooms at

JFK8 are air-conditioned, concentrating workers in those rooms

during the hotter spring and summer months. Moreover, Amazon

changed its break policies, shifting from two twenty-minute breaks

plus lunch per shift to one thirty-five-minute break plus lunch per

shift. Plaintiffs allege this change thwarts workers’ ability to social

distance because more employees are in breakrooms, bathrooms, and

hallways at a given time.

      Plaintiffs further allege that Amazon makes COVID-19 sick

leave inaccessible and fails to pay workers on time and in full under




                                  14
the Leave Law, which encourages workers to forgo taking leave and

attend work while sick.     A JFK8 worker who has symptoms of

COVID-19 or who is exposed to someone with the virus is required to

communicate with Amazon’s human resources (“HR”) team before

taking sick leave pursuant to the Leave Law. The process for learning

whether the employee can stay home is lengthy and confusing.

Plaintiffs recount situations in which they repeatedly called the HR

team but were unable to speak with one of its team members. Once

an employee finally learns that they must quarantine, Amazon fails

to timely provide the employee with full payment of COVID-19 sick

pay.

       Plaintiffs also allege that Amazon’s handling of contact-tracing

fails to adequately track employees who test positive for COVID-19

and the coworkers with whom they came into close contact. Amazon

does not track the symptoms of workers who report exposure to

COVID-19, and it allegedly discourages workers from informing their




                                  15
colleagues that they tested positive for the virus. Amazon also does

not ask COVID-19-positive employees with whom they have come

into close contact at JFK8. Amazon relies solely on surveillance

technology to make these contact determinations, which Plaintiffs

argue is inadequate.

      Lastly, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon fails to deep clean JFK8

and close the facility, whether in whole or in part, after receiving

confirmation that a worker tested positive for COVID-19.

      D.    District court proceedings

      On June 3, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District

Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting claims for public

nuisance, breach of duty under NYLL § 200, and violations of NYLL

§ 191 for failure to pay, on time and in full, COVID-19 sick leave.

Plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which they

subsequently withdrew after Amazon’s announcement on July 13,

2020, concerning changes to productivity policies.

      On July 28, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended four-count



                                  16
complaint expanding their NYLL § 191 claims into a statewide class

action and adding an additional named Plaintiff. In Count I, Plaintiffs

assert that Amazon is creating a public nuisance by failing to comply

with minimum basic health and safety standards at JFK8. Plaintiffs

seek injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C.

§ 2201. In Count II, Plaintiffs allege that Amazon is breaching its duty

to protect the health and safety of its employees under NYLL § 200,

seeking injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C.

§ 2201. In Count III, Plaintiffs seek damages for Amazon’s alleged

failure to timely pay earned COVID-19 sick leave under NYLL § 191.

In Count IV, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Amazon from future failures to

pay earned COVID-19 sick leave on time under NYLL § 191.

      On August 11, 2020, Amazon filed a motion to dismiss the

amended complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)

and 12(b)(6).    The district court granted Amazon’s motion on

November 2, 2020, and entered judgment the following day. Under




                                  17
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the district court dismissed,

without prejudice, Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims.

The court concluded that because the relief Plaintiffs seek “involves

detailed aspects of how Amazon regulates its workplace,” Plaintiffs’

claims turned “on factual issues requiring [OSHA’s] technical and

policy expertise.” App’x at 137. The risk of inconsistent rulings

absent agency deferral and the advantages of applying the doctrine

also tipped in favor of invoking primary jurisdiction.           In the

alternative, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs fail to state a

public nuisance claim because they do not allege special injury, that

Plaintiffs’ claim for past harm under NYLL § 200 is preempted by

New York’s Workers’ Compensation Law, and that Plaintiffs’ NYLL

§ 200 claim based on the threat of future harm fails to allege a

cognizable injury. As to Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 191 claims, the district

court concluded that Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for relief because

COVID-19 sick leave payments are not “wages” under § 191.




                                   18
       On November 24, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.

II.   Discussion

      We review de novo a district court’s grant of a motion to dismiss

under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations in the

complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of

the plaintiff. Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398, 403 (2d Cir.

2015); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). When a district

court invokes the primary jurisdiction doctrine, our standard of

review is likewise de novo. Nat’l Commc’ns Ass’n, Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Tel.

Co., 46 F.3d 220, 222 (2d Cir. 1995) [hereinafter AT&T Co.] (“[T]he

standard of review [of a dismissal on the basis of the primary

jurisdiction doctrine] is essentially de novo.” (citation omitted)); see also

Seneca Nation of Indians v. New York, 988 F.3d 618, 629 (2d Cir. 2021)

(“We review a district court’s decision not to apply the doctrine of

primary jurisdiction de novo.”); Ellis v. Tribune Television Co., 

443 F.3d71, 83 n.14 (2d Cir. 2006) (same).




                                     19
        On appeal, Plaintiffs ask us to vacate the grant of Amazon’s

motion to dismiss, challenging the district court’s conclusions that:

deference is due to OSHA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine;

Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege special harm sufficient to state a claim

for public nuisance; the claim under NYLL § 200 is preempted by

New York’s Workers’ Compensation Law; and COVID-19 sick leave

payments do not constitute “wages” as defined by NYLL § 191.

Amazon moves for partial dismissal of Plaintiffs’ appeal, arguing that

Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are moot because

New York has since rescinded the guidance upon which these claims

rely.

        As a preliminary matter, we deny Amazon’s motion for partial

dismissal. Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are not

moot because these claims do not rely solely upon rescinded New

York guidance, and it is still possible for a court to grant Plaintiffs

injunctive and declaratory relief if they are the prevailing party.




                                    20
Turning to the merits, we agree with Plaintiffs that the district court

wrongly applied the primary jurisdiction doctrine to their public

nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims. But ultimately, as we explain below,

only Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim survives dismissal.

      A.     Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are
             not moot

      As a threshold matter, we must consider Amazon’s motion for

partial dismissal of the appeal on mootness grounds. “[M]ootness

doctrine ensures that [a] litigant’s interest in the outcome continues

to exist throughout the life of the lawsuit.” Conn. Citizens Def. League,

Inc. v. Lamont, 6 F.4th 439, 444 (2d Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks

omitted). If because of changed circumstances “a case that presented

an actual redressable injury at the time it was filed ceases to involve

such an injury, it ceases to fall within a federal court’s Article III

subject matter jurisdiction and must be dismissed for mootness.” Id.
(internal quotation marks omitted). “A case becomes moot when it is

impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the




                                   21
prevailing party.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

       Amazon argues that Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200

claims are moot because the guidance on which these claims rely, the

New York Forward plan, has since been rescinded. 1 We read the

amended complaint differently. Contrary to Amazon’s argument,

Plaintiffs’ claims do not rely solely on alleged violations of New York

Forward guidance. Instead, Plaintiffs use the New York Forward

guidance as one of several guideposts—alongside, for example, the

Leave Law and CDC guidance—for establishing the minimum duty

Amazon owes to Plaintiffs with respect to worker health and safety at

JFK8 in the face of COVID-19.

       Accordingly, a live controversy remains.              In particular,

rescission of the New York Forward guidance did not resolve




       1   As of June 15, 2021, New York lifted most COVID-19 restrictions,
including most New York Forward guidance. New York State, New York Forward,
Archived Industry Guidance, https://forward.ny.gov/archived-industry-guidance
(last visited October 14, 2022) (explaining how the “archived New York Forward
industry reopening guidance documents are no longer mandatory”).




                                     22
whether Amazon “provide[s] reasonable and adequate protection to

the lives, health and safety” of its employees in conformity with

NYLL § 200, 2 App’x at 120, nor did it resolve whether Amazon has

created a public nuisance. Even if Plaintiffs now lack their preferred

guidepost to establish Amazon’s minimum duty to its employees,

“[a]s long as [Plaintiffs] have a concrete interest in the outcome of the

litigation, the case is not moot.” Firefighter’s Local 1784 v. Stotts, 

467U.S. 561, 568 (1984); see New Eng. Health Care Emps. Union, Dist. 1199

v. Mount Sinai Hosp., 65 F.3d 1024, 1029 (2d Cir. 1995) (“[S]o long as




       2 Amazon also points to a May 10, 2022, decision of the First Department
of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court to argue that Plaintiffs’
NYLL § 200 claim should be dismissed as moot. See Appellees’ Rule 28(j) Ltr. (May
12, 2022). There, the First Department concluded that the New York Attorney
General’s NYLL § 200 claim “seeking a permanent injunction requiring Amazon
to undertake policies consistent with COVID-19 workplace guidelines issued by
the State must be dismissed as moot, as the State has withdrawn the public health
guidance that the claim seeks to enforce, including by prospective injunctive
relief.” New York v. Amazon.com, 205 A.D.3d 485, 487 (1st Dep’t 2022). That
decision does not alter our conclusion here. At bottom, the New York Attorney
General in the New York case specifically sought to enforce guidance that is no
longer in place. In comparison, as we explain above, Plaintiffs do not seek to
enforce the now-withdrawn New York guidance. Rather, Plaintiffs rely upon New
York guidance as one of several guideposts to argue that Amazon is breaching the
duty of care it owes to JFK8 workers under NYLL § 200.




                                       23
the appellant retains some interest in the case, so that a decision in its

favor will inure to its benefit, its appeal is not moot.”). Having

considered the remainder of Amazon’s justiciability arguments, we

find them meritless and turn to the substance of Plaintiffs’ appeal.

      B.     The district court incorrectly applied the primary
             jurisdiction doctrine in dismissing Plaintiffs’ state law
             claims in deference to OSHA

      The     federal    courts    have     a   “virtually     unflagging

obligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction given them.”       Tassy v.

Brunswick Hosp. Ctr., Inc., 296 F.3d 65, 73 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Colo.

River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976)).

Here, we must address a “relatively narrow” exception to this

obligation: the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Goya Foods, Inc. v.

Tropicana Prods., Inc., 846 F.2d 848, 851 (2d Cir. 1988). The doctrine is

a prudential one, Schiller v. Tower Semiconductor Ltd., 449 F.3d 286,

294–95 (2d Cir. 2006), fashioned by the courts, TCG N.Y., Inc. v. City of

White Plains, 305 F.3d 67, 74 (2d Cir. 2002), concerned primarily with

“promoting relationships between the courts and [the] administrative



                                    24
agencies charged with particular regulatory duties,” Ellis, 

443 F.3d at81 (quoting United States v. W. Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63 (1956)),

and with ensuring the two “do not work at cross-purposes,” id.
(internal quotation marks omitted).         The doctrine of primary

jurisdiction “applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the

courts, but enforcement of the claim requires, or is materially aided

by, the resolution of threshold issues, usually of a factual nature,

which are placed within the special competence of the administrative

body.” Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians v. Weicker, 39 F.3d 51,

58–59 (2d Cir. 1994).

      For a court to invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine, it must

determine that the agency, not the courts, should have the “initial

decisionmaking responsibility.”      Ellis, 443 F.3d at 81 (emphasis

added) (internal quotation marks omitted). A court’s application of

the primary jurisdiction doctrine thus “does not [necessarily] deprive

the court of jurisdiction.” Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 268–69 (1993).




                                   25
Rather, once a court determines that the doctrine applies, it has

discretion either: (1) to retain jurisdiction or (2) to dismiss the case

without prejudice. Id.
      If the court retains jurisdiction, the case is “held pending the

conclusion of an appropriate administrative proceeding.” Gen. Am.

Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado T. Co., 308 U.S. 422, 433 (1940); see W. Pac.

R.R. Co., 352 U.S. at 64 (“[T]he judicial process is suspended pending

referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.”). In

other words, the case is “stayed so as to give the plaintiff a reasonable

opportunity within which to apply to the [agency] for a ruling.”

Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pa. R.R. Co., 230 U.S. 247, 267 (1913); see also

Reiter, 507 U.S. at 268 n.3 (observing that “‘[r]eferral’ is sometimes

loosely described as a process whereby a court refers an issue to an

agency,” and clarifying that the Supreme Court’s decision in Mitchell

Coal “spelled out the actual procedure contemplated [in] holding that

further action by the district court should be stayed so as to give the




                                    26
plaintiff a reasonable opportunity within which to apply to the

[agency] for a ruling as to the reasonableness of the practice” (internal

quotation marks omitted)).

      A court in its discretion may choose to dismiss the case without

prejudice—but only “if the parties would not be unfairly

disadvantaged.” Reiter, 507 U.S. at 268. To determine whether a party

will be unfairly disadvantaged, a court can look to the relief the party

is seeking.   For example, in Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound

Conference, the Supreme Court distinguished between a plaintiff

seeking injunctive relief and a plaintiff seeking damages. 383 U.S. 213,

222–23 (1966). There, the Supreme Court noted how, unlike a suit for

injunctive relief from continuing conduct—a suit that “could easily be

reinstituted if and when the [agency] determined” the questions at

issue—a “damage[s] action for past conduct cannot be easily

reinstated at a later time” because “[s]uch claims are subject to the

Statute of Limitations.” Id. Our Court applied these principles in




                                   27
Mathirampuzha v. Potter, where we vacated the district court’s

dismissal and remanded with instructions to stay the proceedings

pending a final determination by the administrative agency because

dismissing the case presented “a significant danger of unfair

disadvantage . . . inasmuch as the plaintiff’s claim [was] subject to a

statute of limitations.” 548 F.3d 70, 84–85 (2d Cir. 2008).

      When determining whether to apply the doctrine of primary

jurisdiction, a court must look to “whether the reasons for the

existence of the doctrine are present and whether the purposes it

serves will be aided by its application in the particular litigation.” W.

Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. at 64. These reasons and purposes are two-fold.

Tassy, 296 F.3d at 68. First, the doctrine seeks to foster “uniformity

and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular

agency.” Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 851 (alteration omitted) (quoting

Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 426 U.S. 290, 303–04 (1976)); see Tex. &

Pac. Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 440 (1907)




                                    28
(concluding that “without previous action by the [agency], power

might be exerted by courts and juries generally to determine the

reasonableness of an established rate, [and] it would follow that

unless all courts reached an identical conclusion a uniform standard

of rates in the future would be impossible”). Second, the doctrine

recognizes that, for certain matters, “‘the expert and specialized

knowledge of the agencies’ should be ascertained before judicial

consideration of the legal claim.” Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 851 (quoting

W. Pac. R.R., 352 U.S. at 64); see Great N. Ry. Co. v. Merchs.’ Elevator Co.,

259 U.S. 285, 291 (1922) (invoking primary jurisdiction because “the

inquiry is essentially one of fact and of discretion in technical

matters”).

       With the doctrine’s reasons and purposes in mind, we turn to

whether deferring to OSHA here is appropriate. Although “[n]o fixed

formula exists for applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,” Ellis,

443 F.3d at 82 (quoting W. Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. at 64), and we




                                     29
generally conduct our analysis on a “case-by-case basis,” Gen. Elec.

Co. v. MV Nedlloyd, 817 F.2d 1022, 1026 (2d Cir. 1987), in Ellis v. Tribune

Television Co., our Court highlighted four factors—which we refer to

here as the “Ellis factors”—upon which we focus our analysis:

      (1) whether the question at issue is within the
      conventional experience of judges or whether it involves
      technical or policy considerations within the agency’s
      particular field of expertise; (2) whether the question at
      issue is particularly within the agency’s discretion;
      (3) whether there exists a substantial danger of
      inconsistent rulings; and (4) whether a prior application
      to the agency has been made.

443 F.3d at 82–83. We must also “balance the advantages of applying

the doctrine against the potential costs resulting from complications

and delay in the administrative proceedings.” Id. at 83 (quoting

AT&T Co., 46 F.3d at 223).

          1.     The Ellis Factors

      Upon weighing the Ellis factors, balancing the advantages of

applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction with the potential costs,

and considering the doctrine’s two-fold aim—particularly the




                                     30
importance of the courts staying their hand in favor of an agency’s

knowledge and expertise—we conclude that the district court

incorrectly applied the doctrine to Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and

NYLL § 200 claims.

             a.    The question at issue is within the conventional
                   experience of judges

      Amazon argues that “Plaintiffs have asked the district court to

craft out of whole cloth a series of regulations applicable to JFK8

alone,” which it contends “is not the core competence of courts.”

Amazon Br. at 21. But the issues before us are tort-based claims—

public nuisance and breach of NYLL § 200—that are within the

conventional experience of judges.

      Generally, we decline to apply the doctrine of primary

jurisdiction “when the issue at stake is legal in nature and lies within

the traditional realm of judicial competence.” Goya Foods, 

846 F.2d at851. For instance, in determining whether it was appropriate to apply

the doctrine, we have identified the following as within “the daily fare




                                  31
of federal judges,” Schiller, 449 F.3d at 295: statutory interpretation,

id.; applying “reasonably settled definitions” in a statute to the facts

of a case, F.T.C. v. Verity Int’l, Ltd., 443 F.3d 48, 60 (2d Cir. 2006); issues

of contract interpretation, Fulton Cogeneration Assocs. v. Niagara

Mohawk Power Corp., 84 F.3d 91, 97 (2d Cir. 1996); and issues involving

“the application of common law principles,” Gen. Elec. Co., 817 F.2d

at 1027–28.

       Looking at the questions before us here, courts routinely decide

whether a defendant’s conduct constitutes a public nuisance. See, e.g.,

Benoit v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., 959 F.3d 491, 504–05

(2d Cir. 2020); Connecticut v. Am. Elec. Power Co., 582 F.3d 309, 353 (2d

Cir. 2009), rev’d on other grounds, 564 U.S. 410 (2011); New York v. Shore

Realty Corp., 759 F.2d 1032, 1050–52 (2d Cir. 1985); 532 Madison Ave.

Gourmet Foods v. Finlandia Ctr., 96 N.Y.2d 280, 292 (2001); see also Tull

v. United States, 481 U.S. 412, 423 (1987) (“A public nuisance action

was a classic example of the kind of suit that relied on injunctive relief




                                      32
provided by courts in equity.”). In addressing this issue, we must

answer antecedent questions of whether a defendant is endangering

the health or safety of a considerable number of persons and whether

a plaintiff has alleged that they suffer special injury beyond that

suffered by the community at large. See Benoit, 959 F.3d at 504–05; 532

Madison Ave., 96 N.Y.2d at 292.

       Similarly, Plaintiffs’ § 200 claim presents questions sounding in

state tort law, and routinely addressed by courts: what duty of care

Amazon owes to Plaintiffs and whether Amazon is in breach of its

duty. See, e.g., In re World Trade Ctr. Lower Manhattan Disaster Site

Litig., 758 F.3d 202, 210 (2d Cir. 2014); Caronia v. Philip Morris USA,

Inc., 715 F.3d 417, 428 (2d Cir. 2013); Akins v. Glens Falls City Sch. Dist.,

53 N.Y.2d 325, 331, 333 (1981). As NYLL § 200 is a codification of the

common law duty to provide workers with a safe work environment,

e.g., Lombardi v. Stout, 80 N.Y.2d 290, 294 (N.Y. 1992); Everitt v.

Nozkowski, 285 A.D.2d 442, 443 (2d Dep’t 2001), a federal court here




                                     33
can look to New York’s common law to inform its determination as

to whether Amazon breached the duty of care it owed to Plaintiffs.

And where common law principles are at play, we have determined

that the issues should be addressed in a judicial forum. See, e.g., Gen.

Elec. Co., 817 F.2d at 1027–28 (“[T]he application of common law

principles [is] more competently decided in a judicial forum”

(internal citations omitted)).

      Amazon also takes issue with the relief Plaintiffs seek, arguing

that Plaintiffs ask the district court to regulate through an injunction

and to address “detailed aspects” of operations at JFK8, thereby

making OSHA, not the courts, the forum best positioned to evaluate

Plaintiffs’ claims. Amazon Br. at 23–24. But Amazon’s arguments

about the possible scope of relief do not transform the traditional state

tort law questions before us into issues requiring OSHA’s technical

and policy expertise. Before relief can be fashioned, questions of

injury, duty, and breach must be addressed.           These questions,




                                   34
including whether the relief requested exceeds that warranted by the

injuries alleged, are squarely within a district court’s bailiwick.

             b.     The question at issue is not particularly within
                    the agency’s discretion

      To determine whether a question falls particularly within an

agency’s discretion, a court looks not to whether administrative

proceedings will make any contribution to resolving the question

before it, but whether administrative proceedings are “likely to make

a meaningful contribution” to resolving the question. Ricci v. Chi.

Mercantile Exch., 409 U.S. 289, 306 (1973) (emphasis added) (internal

quotation marks omitted). Thus, under the second Ellis factor we ask

“whether an agency’s review of the facts ‘will be a material aid’ to the

court ultimately charged with applying” the facts to the law. Tassy,

296 F.3d at 73 (emphasis added) (quoting Ricci, 409 U.S. at 305).

OSHA’s review of these facts would not be such an aid.

      Congress created OSHA through the Occupational Safety and

Health Act of 1970 (the “OSH Act”) to “assure . . . safe and healthful




                                   35
working conditions” for workers by setting and enforcing standards

and providing research, education, and training in the field of

occupational safety and health. 29 U.S.C. § 651. It is therefore within

OSHA’s competence to evaluate and create workplace health and

safety standards.    But even assuming this case falls within that

competence, “[i]n the primary jurisdiction context, whether an agency

is statutorily authorized to resolve a particular issue is not itself

determinative of whether to apply the doctrine.” Tassy, 

296 F.3d at73.

      To determine whether an agency’s expertise would materially

aid the court, we often assess whether a given issue is “legal in

nature,” Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 851–52, or “of a factual nature,” Golden

Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians, 39 F.3d at 58–59. For example, we have

concluded that it is particularly within the Bureau of Indian Affairs’

discretion to resolve “factual issues regarding tribal status,” Id. at 60,

and that the Federal Communications Commission’s exclusive




                                   36
authority over licensing materially aids the “highly factual inquiry”

of whether to apply a license waiver. Ellis, 443 F.3d at 83–85. But even

in those instances, categorizing the nature of the issue does not end

our inquiry.

      When a court is asked to resolve a factual issue the subject-

matter of which falls within an agency’s purview, the question is not

whether, in the abstract, it would be helpful for the agency to set

standards of its own. The issue is instead whether the agency’s

expertise would materially assist the court in resolving difficult

factual questions to determine whether specified legal standards have

been violated. For instance, in Tassy v. Brunswick Hospital Center, Inc.,

an agency’s medical expertise was not required to resolve the

pertinent factual issue before the Court: whether the defendant

committed the alleged sexual harassment. 296 F.3d at 70–71. The

issue did not “implicate any medical data or complex records,” and

so, it was not particularly difficult for a court to handle, nor




                                   37
particularly necessary for an agency to resolve. Id. Similarly, in AT&T

Co., determining whether a party qualified for a lower contract tariff

rate depended on answering the “rather simple factual question” of

whether a party had timely paid its bills, a question whose resolution

was “within the district court’s experience” and did not require the

FCC’s “policy expertise, or its specialized knowledge.” 46 F.3d at 223.

      In support of its contention that the public nuisance and NYLL

§ 200 questions before us are particularly within OSHA’s discretion,

Amazon argues that Plaintiffs’ claims “turn on factual issues

requiring both technical and policy expertise.”       Amazon Br. 23

(internal quotation marks omitted). Amazon highlights how, as of

December 2020, OSHA had “conduct[ed] more than 1,430 COVID-

related inspections and issu[ed] citations totaling more than

$3,849,222 to 294 employers.” Id. at 25. But Amazon fails to mention

that OSHA issued most of those COVID-related citations to

employers in the healthcare sector. See Dep’t of Labor Br. at 33, AFT




                                  38
v. OSHA, No. 20-73203 (9th Cir. Dec. 31, 2020) (noting that, of the 294

employers to have received COVID-related citations, 261 were

employers in the healthcare sector). As such, the COVID-related

citations are consistent with OSHA’s other actions during the

pandemic that have prioritized healthcare workers—namely, its

issuance of an emergency temporary standard (“ETS,” discussed at

greater length below) governing the health and safety of healthcare

and healthcare support workers. These healthcare-focused actions,

therefore, do not necessarily suggest that OSHA’s expertise would

materially aid the court in resolving the issues relating to JFK8.

      Indeed, no OSHA action to date, nor any executive order

concerning worker health and safety, confirms that deferring to

OSHA would be appropriate. On January 21, 2021, President Biden

issued a proclamation directing OSHA to issue revised guidance for

employers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to “consider whether

any emergency temporary standards on COVID-19 . . . are necessary.”




                                  39
Proclamation No. 13999, 86 Fed. Reg. 7,211, § 2(b) (Jan. 21, 2021). In

response, OSHA issued the following in January 2021: (1) guidance

clarifying that OSHA’s existing standards that protect workers from

infectious diseases—see, e.g., 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.134 (standard for

respiratory protection), 1910.136 (standard for personal protective

equipment), 1910.141 (standard for sanitation)—remain in place as

protection from contracting and spreading COVID-19, see Dep’t of

Labor, Occupational Safety & Health Admin., Protecting Workers:

Guidance on Mitigating and Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in the

Workplace (posted Jan. 29, 2021) (updated June 10, 2021),

https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework; and (2) an ETS “to

protect healthcare and healthcare support service workers from

occupational exposure to COVID-19,” 86 Fed. Reg. 32,376, 32,376. On

November 5, 2021, OSHA issued another ETS, one aimed at

protecting “unvaccinated employees of large employers (100 or more

employees) from the risk of contracting COVID-19 by strongly




                                 40
encouraging vaccination.” 3 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402, 61,402. The Supreme

Court temporarily stayed the latter ETS on January 13, 2022, see Nat’l

Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 142 S. Ct. 661, 666–67 (2022), and

shortly thereafter, OSHA withdrew it, see 87 Fed. Reg. 3,928.

       Although OSHA has since rescinded the November 2021

vaccination and testing ETS, Amazon argues that “even if the ETS

never takes effect, it still represents an unambiguous assertion of

OSHA’s expertise and jurisdiction over the health-and-safety issues

at issue here.” Amazon 28(j) Ltr. at 2 (Jan. 20, 2022). And that “[e]ven

if the ETS currently lacks preemptive force,” the OSH Act still

preempts Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim. Id. We disagree.

       With the ETS rescinded, there is no risk that, by resolving

Plaintiffs’ claims, a court would be wading into an area already


3OSHA issued the vaccination and testing ETS after President Biden urged the
agency to promulgate an emergency temporary standard requiring “all employers
with 100 or more employees . . . to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or
show a negative test at least once a week.” President Joseph Biden, Remarks on
Fighting      the       COVID-19         Pandemic        (Sept.       9,     2021),

                                        41
occupied by OSHA. And even had OSHA not rescinded the ETS,

there is no reason to think that the agency was poised to

“unambiguous[ly] assert[]” jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, which

concern, among other things, social distancing and sick leave. Indeed,

the rescinded ETS limited itself to vaccination. Accordingly, even if

OSHA were to indicate that it was on the verge of re-entering the fray

on vaccination, that would hardly lead to the conclusion that the

agency was planning to go so far as to regulate sick leave, social

distancing, or any other areas implicated by Plaintiffs’ claims. Under

these circumstances, we conclude that OSHA’s particular expertise

would not materially aid the resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims.

             c.    There is no substantial danger of inconsistent
                   rulings

      Because OSHA has chosen not to promulgate a cross-industry,

COVID-19-specific standard that would govern the facts of this case,

our conclusion that the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply

presents no substantial danger of inconsistent rulings.          “Federal




                                  42
regulation of the workplace [under the OSH Act] was not intended to

be all encompassing.” Gade v. Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 

505 U.S.88, 96 (1992). Instead, “Congress expressly saved two areas from

federal pre-emption”: (1) “Section 4(b)(4) of the OSH Act states that

the Act does not . . . ‘enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner

the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers

and employees under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or

death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment,’”

id. (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 653(b)(4)); and (2) “Section 18(a) provides that

the Act does not ‘prevent any State agency or court from asserting

jurisdiction under State law over any occupational safety or health

issue with respect to which no [federal] standard is in effect.’” Id. at

96–97 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 667(a)).

      There are no federal standards in effect governing the COVID-

19 protocols at JFK8 that Plaintiffs challenge in their amended

complaint. And even where there may be some overlap between




                                   43
agency and court action, overlap alone does not justify invoking the

primary jurisdiction doctrine, see Goya Foods, 846 F.2d at 850
(concluding that “the pendency of a [Patent and Trademark Office]

proceeding was not a proper basis to forestall [the plaintiff’s]

lawsuit”), especially where the agency’s organic statute permits a

parallel enforcement scheme, as is the case here with the OSH Act, see,

e.g., Nader, 426 U.S. at 299–302 (concluding that the common law tort

action for fraudulent misrepresentation and the Federal Aviation Act

“are not ‘absolutely inconsistent’ and may coexist”).

      Moreover, even if OSHA’s vaccination and testing ETS were

still in effect, that ETS would not alter this conclusion, as a state

occupational safety or health standard is only preempted to the extent

that it is “inconsistent” and “relate[s] to the issues addressed by [the]

ETS.” 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402, 61,505. As the ETS said, “[s]tate and local

requirements that ban or otherwise limit workplace vaccination, face

covering, or testing clearly ‘relate’ to the occupational safety and




                                   44
health ‘issues’ that OSHA is regulating in this ETS.” 86 Fed. Reg.

61,402, 61,508; see also Gade, 505 U.S. at 99 (“The principal indication

that Congress intended to pre-empt state law is § 18(b)’s statement

that a State ‘shall’ submit a plan if it wishes to ‘assume responsibility’

for ‘development and enforcement . . . of occupational safety and

health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue

with respect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated.’”

(emphasis added)). Plaintiffs’ claims do not relate to those issues.

Accordingly, there is no substantial risk of inconsistent rulings.

             d.     Plaintiffs have not made a prior application to
                    the agency

      Finally, while not determinative, the fact that Plaintiffs have

made no prior application to OSHA weighs against applying the

doctrine of primary jurisdiction. “If prior application to the agency is

present, this factor provides support for the conclusion that the

doctrine of primary jurisdiction is appropriate.” Ellis, 443 F.3d at 89
(emphasis added); see also Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians, 39




                                   45
F.3d at 60 (concluding deferral to the agency was “fully warranted . . .

where the plaintiff has already invoked the BIA’s authority”). Thus,

“if prior application to the agency is absent, this factor may weigh

against referral of the matter to the agency.” Ellis, 443 F.3d at 89
(emphasis added); see also Schiller, 449 F.3d at 295 (noting how,

ordinarily, the fact that “the party challenging the agency action . . .

made no prior application to the agency,” would “weigh against

primary jurisdiction”). The fourth Ellis factor, in other words, seeks

to accomplish one of the doctrine’s central aims: “to ensure that courts

and agencies with concurrent jurisdiction over a matter do not work

at cross-purposes.” Fulton Cogeneration Assocs., 84 F.3d at 97. Here,

there is no pending proceeding before the agency, and there is no

indication that the agency is poised to take up the specific questions

before us, meaning that there is minimal, if any, concern that a court

will resolve Plaintiffs’ claims and fashion a remedy in a way that

would work at a “cross-purpose” with OSHA’s actions.




                                  46
         2.    Balancing the advantages and the costs

      In deciding whether to apply the primary jurisdiction doctrine,

we must also “balance the advantages of applying the doctrine

against the potential costs resulting from complications and delay in

the administrative proceedings.”      Ellis, 443 F.3d at 83 (internal

quotation marks omitted).     We conclude that the potential costs

would outweigh the advantages. Given OSHA’s understandable

prioritization during the COVID-19 pandemic of the healthcare sector

and the issuance of nationwide mandates such as vaccination

requirements for certain private employers, it is not apparent that

OSHA is likely, as a policy matter, to shift gears and prioritize

developing more general workplace COVID-19 safety standards—

much less standards that would provide meaningful guidance with

respect to Amazon’s JFK8 facility. We discern that abstention in favor

of action by OSHA has the potential to delay this litigation, without

any likelihood of countervailing advantages.

      In sum, we conclude that the district court erred in abstaining



                                 47
based on the primary jurisdiction doctrine.

      C.     Plaintiffs do not plausibly plead a special injury to
             support a public nuisance claim against Amazon

      The district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs’ public nuisance

claim because Plaintiffs fail to allege special injury. Under New York

law, “[a] cause of action for public nuisance ‘exists for conduct that

amounts to a substantial interference with the exercise of a common

right,’ such as ‘endangering’ the ‘health[ or] safety . . . of a

considerable number of persons.’” Benoit, 959 F.3d at 504 (quoting

532 Madison Ave., 96 N.Y.2d at 292). A private person has a cause of

action for public nuisance “only if it is shown that the person suffered

special injury beyond that suffered by the community at large.” Id. at

505 (internal quotation marks omitted). “The injury must be different

in ‘kind,’ not simply ‘degree.’” Id. (quoting 532 Madison Ave., 96

N.Y.2d at 293–94). It therefore is not enough that a private person

“has suffered the same kind of harm or interference but to a greater

extent or degree.” Am. Elec. Power Co., 582 F.3d at 367 (quoting




                                  48
Restatement (Second) Torts § 812C, cmt. b).           The Restatement

(Second) of Torts provides helpful insight into the rule that a private

person must suffer a special injury to state a claim for public nuisance.

Comment a to Section 821C states that “it is uniformly agreed that a

private individual has no tort action for the invasion of the purely

public right, unless his damage is to be distinguished from that

sustained by other members of the public.”

      Plaintiffs argue that “Amazon’s maintenance of an unsafe work

environment causes a different kind of harm to Plaintiffs because it is

a direct affront to their health and safety in their homes and

workplaces.” Plaintiffs Br. at 34. Plaintiffs contend that, unlike

members of the public at large, who can protect themselves from the

virus by avoiding public places, they lack the autonomy to avoid the

reach of Amazon’s conduct since they cannot avoid JFK8 or their

homes. According to Plaintiffs, they have “no meaningful choice but

to subject themselves to Amazon’s misconduct.” Id. at 38.




                                   49
      Amazon counters with the argument that “everyone in New

York who goes to work, the grocery store, or anywhere else risks

being ‘directly exposed’ to COVID-19. The physical, emotional, and

financial harms visited on New York by the virus are common to the

entire community, not unique to Plaintiffs.” Amazon Br. at 40. And

with respect to the Non-Employee Plaintiffs, Amazon argues that

they experience the “same kind of risk that all New Yorkers face when

a family member interacts with others in the community, either by

going to work, shopping at a grocery store, or having a service

technician or other person visit their home.” Id. at 41. Although we

do not discount the risks Plaintiffs allege they face nor the harms

Plaintiffs allege they experience, we agree with Amazon that

Plaintiffs’ alleged harms are different in degree, not in kind, and so

do not make out the requisite special injury to state a claim for public

nuisance. 4


      4
          To claim that their harm is different in kind and not merely degree,




                                      50
       Similarly, Plaintiffs’ allegations that they have suffered

financial losses, including lost wages, because they have avoided

work as a result of Amazon’s workplace safety practices, fail to meet

the special injury requirement. Again, because of the pandemic, the

public at large has suffered the same kind of harm—often devastating

financial losses—that Plaintiffs allege. In fact, Plaintiffs agree that

“the New York economy has been hard-hit by the pandemic.” App’x

at 82. Like Plaintiffs, many other residents of New York have forgone

attending work because of a generalized risk of contracting COVID-




Plaintiffs rely on the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Ileto v. Glock, 349 F.3d 1191 (9th
Cir. 2003). Plaintiffs Br. at 37. There, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs
sufficiently alleged that they “suffered an injury, namely trauma resulting from an
assault with a gun and gun shot wounds, different in kind” from the injuries
experienced by the general public. Ileto, 349 F.3d at 1212 (internal quotation marks
omitted).
        Plaintiffs’ reliance on Ileto is misplaced. As shooting victims, the Ileto
plaintiffs alleged harms (gunshot wounds and trauma) different in kind from the
generalized fear and anxiety the plaintiffs alleged that the public experienced
following the shooting. Id. at 1211–12. Without expressing any view on the
correctness of the Ninth Circuit’s decision, we conclude that Plaintiffs here have
not alleged any analogous harm. Regardless of whether a person works at JFK8,
is a member of a JFK8 employee’s household, or is a member of the public at large,
the alleged harm remains the same: an interference with one’s health and safety—
whether through contracting the virus or through fear of contracting the virus.




                                          51
19. And as New York courts have made clear, when “pecuniary

damages are ‘so general and widespread as to affect a whole

community, or a very wide area within it,’” that injury is the same in

kind. 532 Madison Ave., 96 N.Y.2d at 293.

       Plaintiffs compare their situation to that of the plaintiff-

homeowners in Fresh Air for the Eastside, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt. of New

York, 405 F. Supp. 3d 408 (W.D.N.Y. 2019), who owned property near

a noxious landfill. See Plaintiffs Br. 34. Plaintiffs effectively assert that

their inability to avoid their workplaces and their homes is akin to the

Fresh Air plaintiffs’ “inability to fully utilize their homes” and the

diminution in value of their homes resulting from living adjacent to a

noxious landfill. 405 F. Supp. 3d at 442. But in the case of the noxious

landfill, the plaintiffs’ special injury arose from the landfill’s

interference with their property rights, not from a lack of autonomy

over leaving their homes. Id. Here, the public at large shares in the

risk of contracting COVID-19, regardless of property ownership and




                                     52
employment. As the district court correctly concluded, the general

public cannot avoid the risk of exposure to COVID-19 “simply by

avoiding JFK8, its immediate surrounding area, and its employees.”

App’x at 140.

      To be sure, in Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co, Inc., our

Court suggested that “[d]ifference in degree . . . as a measure of a

different kind of harm, is not entirely out of the picture.” 

582 F.3d at368. This statement relied on comment c to § 821C of the Restatement

(Second) of Torts, which provides that “[d]ifference in degree of

interference cannot . . . be entirely disregarded in determining

whether there has been difference in kind.” The comment provides

an example:

      Normally there may be no difference in the kind of
      interference with one who travels a road once a week and
      one who travels it every day. But if the plaintiff traverses
      the road a dozen times a day he nearly always has some
      special reason to do so, and that reason will almost
      invariably be based upon some special interest of his
      own, not common to the community. Significant
      interference with that interest may be particular damage,




                                  53
      sufficient to support the action in tort. . . . Thus in
      determining whether there is a difference in the kind of
      harm, the degree of interference may be a factor of
      importance that must be considered.

But in American Electric Power Co. we did not need to “demarcate the

outer limits of § 821C(1)’s requirement that the harms be different in

kind (sometimes called ‘special injury’), because the harms asserted

by the [plaintiffs] qualif[ied]” as a special injury (i.e., a harm that was

different in kind). 582 F.3d at 368. We thus did not go so far as to hold

that the degree of a plaintiff’s harm plays a part in determining

whether that harm is different in kind.         And because Plaintiffs’

asserted injury from COVID-19 exposure is not so markedly greater

in degree than that faced by large numbers of the public, we likewise

decline to reach that question today.

      D.     The New York Workers’ Compensation Law does not
             bar claims for injunctive relief under NYLL § 200

      Amazon argues that the New York Workers’ Compensation

Law (“NYWCL”) precludes Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief

under New York Labor Law (“NYLL”) § 200. We disagree.



                                    54
      The New York Court of Appeals has not yet had the

opportunity to decide this question of New York law, so our task is to

predict how it would rule. See In re Brooklyn Navy Yard Asbestos Litig.,

971 F.2d 831, 850 (2d Cir. 1992). And where the highest court of the

state has not spoken, “the best indicators of how it would decide are

often the decisions of lower state courts.” Id. Here, the text, history,

and underlying purposes of the NYWCL, coupled with relevant

precedent from New York’s intermediate courts, enable us to predict

what the New York Court of Appeals would hold: the NYWCL’s

exclusivity provision does not bar claims for injunctive relief under

NYLL § 200.

      Construing New York law, “[o]ur analysis begins with the

language of the statute.” People v. Francis, 30 N.Y.3d 737, 745 (2018).

In addition to statutory language itself, the specific context in which

statutory language is used and the broader context of the statute as a

whole assist the court in ascertaining the text’s plain meaning. See




                                  55
Scott v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 86 N.Y.2d 429, 435 (1995); see also

Albano v. Kirby, 36 N.Y.2d 526, 530 (1975) (“No rule of construction . . .

permits the segregation of a few words from their context and from

all the rest of the section or rule . . . .”). And “[l]iteral meanings of

words are not to be adhered to or suffered to ‘defeat the general

purpose and manifest policy intended to be promoted’” by a given

statute. Council of City of New York v. Giuliani, 93 N.Y.2d 60, 69 (1999)

(quoting People v. Ryan, 274 N.Y. 149, 152 (1937)).

      In this case, we must ascertain the plain meaning of both NYLL

§ 200 and NYWCL § 11. NYLL § 200 outlines the general duty of

employers to safeguard their employees’ well-being by providing

“reasonable and adequate protection to [their] lives, health and

safety” in the workplace. As NYLL § 200 is “a codification of the

common-law duty to provide workers with a safe work

environment,” it essentially codifies a claim for common law

negligence. Everitt, 285 A.D.2d at 443; In re World Trade Ctr. Lower




                                   56
Manhattan Disaster Site Litig., 758 F.3d at 210 (“Codifying common law

negligence, New York Labor Law § 200 provides for a general duty to

protect the health and safety of employees.”).

       The NYWCL focuses on monetary compensation for workers’

injuries. Section 10 requires that an employer “secure compensation

to his employees and pay or provide compensation for their disability

or death from injury arising out of and in the course of the

employment.” And section 11 clarifies that this liability “shall be

exclusive and in place of any other liability whatsoever, to such

employee . . . entitled to recover damages, contribution or indemnity,

at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury or death or

liability arising therefrom . . . .”

       To argue that the NYWCL bars Plaintiffs’ claims, Amazon relies

on the language in NYWCL § 11 providing that the law is exclusive

of “any other liability whatsoever.”        This language, Amazon

contends, illustrates that section 11 protects “employers from suit,”




                                       57
including suits in both law and equity. Amazon Br. at 48 (internal

quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs, on the other hand, interpret the

exclusivity provision to preclude employees from seeking damages,

but not injunctive relief, from employers under NYLL § 200. 5

       The text of NYWCL § 11 supports Plaintiffs’ interpretation.

Namely,      the   language      Amazon       cites—“any       other    liability

whatsoever”—cannot be divorced from the monetary awards listed

later in the same sentence: “damages, contribution, or indemnity.”

N.Y. Workers’ Comp. Law § 11 (McKinney 2017); see Albano, 

36N.Y.2d at 530; see also King v. Time Warner Cable Inc., 894 F.3d 473, 477
(2d Cir. 2018) (“[W]ords to be interpreted are not considered in

isolation.”); City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 524 F.3d 384, 401
(2d Cir. 2008) (“[W]here specific words follow a general word, the



5 As a threshold matter, we do not find it necessary to separate Plaintiffs’
arguments under NYLL § 200 into distinct backward- and forward-looking claims.
Plaintiffs asked the district court to enjoin Amazon from continuing with its
alleged breach of duty under NYLL § 200. That Plaintiffs cite both past and
ongoing conduct to support their need for injunctive relief does not require us to
split their single claim in two.




                                       58
specific words restrict application of the general term to things that

are similar to those enumerated.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

That list of monetary awards confirms that the “liability” referenced

in the NYWCL’s exclusivity provision is confined to claims for

retrospective damages and does not encompass claims for injunctive

relief.

          The NYWCL’s legislative history and New York appellate court

cases further demonstrate that the NYWCL seeks to balance the

monetary interests of employers and employees, while the NYLL

focuses more on regulating employers’ conduct. See, e.g., Acevedo v.

Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc., 189 A.D.2d 497, 502–03 (1st

Dep’t 1993) (“The courts of this state have long held that, if an injury

or disease is covered in any way by Workers’ Compensation, recovery

at law for a particular type of damage resulting from that injury or

disease, even though not compensable, will also be barred.”

(emphasis added)); Huston v. Hayden Bldg. Maintenance Corp., 205




                                   
59A.D.2d 68, 71 (2d Dep’t 1994) (“In our view the primary purpose of

the [NYLL] is to regulate conduct.”).

      The NYWCL was adopted pursuant to a 1913 amendment to

New York’s constitution, which provided that the legislature could

“fix the right to compensation to be paid by an employer for death

resulting to an employee for injuries received in the course of his

employment,” and that “the right of such compensation, and the

remedy therefor shall be exclusive of all other rights and remedies.”

Shanahan v. Monarch Eng’g Co., 219 N.Y. 469, 475–76 (1916) (quoting

1913 constitutional amendment). When promulgating the NYWCL,

the New York legislature thereby created a scheme in which both

employer and employee “gained benefits and made concessions.” 

Id.at 478.

      As part of this tradeoff, the employee receives “the security of

knowing that fixed benefits will be paid,” but forgoes the possibility

of “a more substantial recovery through a jury award.” Dumervil v.




                                 60
Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 163 A.D.3d 628, 629 (2d Dep’t 2018). The

employer is on the hook for “no-fault liability,” but is protected from

the “large damage verdicts which the statute was intended to

foreclose.” Reich v. Manhattan Boiler & Equip. Corp., 91 N.Y.2d 772, 780
(1998); see also Shanahan, 219 N.Y. at 477 (noting that part of the

tradeoff between employers and employees includes an employer not

needing to defend against “unjust or excessive claims”).

       In other words, the legislature was concerned primarily with

the predictability of monetary compensation when adopting the

NYWCL.       See Werner v. State, 53 N.Y.2d 346, 353 (1981) (“[T]he

obvious purpose of those provisions [is] to foreclose the possibility of

duplicative recoveries.”). 6 Had the legislature intended to extend the

NYWCL’s exclusivity provision to injunctive relief as well, it could




       6 Here, there is no risk of duplicative recoveries because the Workmen’s
Compensation Board cannot issue the remedy Plaintiffs seek—an injunction
compelling Amazon to cease the conduct alleged as jeopardizing the health and
safety of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. See N.Y. Workers’ Comp.
Law § 142 (outlining the Board’s “[g]eneral powers and duties”).




                                      61
have so provided, and so altered the tradeoff for both employers and

employees. In the absence of such a statement from the legislature,

however, we decline to extend the exclusivity provision’s reach.

      E.    COVID-19 leave payments are not “wages” under
            NYLL § 191

      Lastly, Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for a violation of NYLL

§ 191 because, as the district court correctly concluded, COVID-19

leave payments are not “wages” as defined by § 191.

      NYLL § 191 outlines the frequency with which an employer

shall pay an employee “wages.” Wages are defined as “the earnings

of an employee for labor or services rendered, regardless of whether

the amount of earnings is determined on a time, piece, commission or

other basis.” N.Y. Lab. Law § 190(1) (McKinney 2008). For purposes

of NYLL § 191, the term “wages” does not include “benefits or wage

supplements.”     Id.    Benefits or wage supplements include

“reimbursement for expenses; health, welfare, and retirement

benefits; and vacation, separation or holiday pay.” Id. § 198-c(2),




                                 62
preempted on other grounds by 75 A.D.3d 755 (3d Dep’t 2010). And New

York’s Leave Law “provid[es] requirements for sick leave and the

provision of certain employee benefits when such employee is subject

to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation due

to COVID-19.” 2020 N.Y. Sess. Laws ch. 25, § 1.1.(a) (McKinney).

      Plaintiffs argue that excepting COVID-19 sick leave from NYLL

§ 191’s “frequency-of-pay provisions” for wages would undermine

the Leave Law’s purpose because the “[p]romise of wages at some

unspecified future date is unlikely to convince a potentially infected

worker to self-isolate if that worker is subsisting week-to-week.”

Plaintiffs Br. at 52. But the New York legislature, well aware that

NYLL § 191 explicitly excludes benefits or wage supplements from its

provisions, described the purpose of the Leave Law as “providing

requirements for sick leave and the provision of certain employee

benefits.” 2020 N.Y. Laws 8091.

      Moreover, COVID-19 sick leave need not be subject to NYLL




                                  63
§ 191’s pay frequency requirements to serve as an “effective tool[] at

protecting public health.” Plaintiffs Br. at 51. Plaintiffs still have a

form of redress available under the Leave Law: they can file a

complaint with the New York Department of Labor (the “NYDOL”).

N.Y.     State,    Dep’t     of    Labor,     COVID-19       Complaint,

https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Department-of-Labor-COVID-19-Complaint

(last visited October 14, 2022).

       Plaintiffs next assert that COVID-19 sick leave payments are

“wages” for purposes of NYLL § 191 because the pay is a statutory

entitlement rather than an “ancillary benefit or wage supplement”

created by employment contract. Plaintiffs Br. at 54. As we explained

in Myers v. Hertz Corp., however, “plaintiffs may not use Labor Law

§ 191 to seek unpaid wages to which they claim to be entitled under a

statute; rather § 191 guarantees only that the wages the employer and

employee have ‘agreed’ upon be paid in a ‘timely’ manner again

according to the ‘terms of [the employee’s] employment.” 





624 F.3d64537, 545 n.1 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting N.Y. Lab. Law § 191).

      We also reject Plaintiffs’ contention that the district court

improperly ignored the NYDOL’s Frequently Asked Questions (the

“FAQ”) concerning COVID-19 sick leave. In pertinent part, the FAQ

explains that “[t]he paid COVID-19 sick leave payments are subject to

the frequency of pay requirements of Section 191.” N.Y. State, New

York Paid Family Leave COVID-19: Frequently Asked Questions

[hereinafter        Paid          Family         Leave          FAQs],

https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/new-york-paid-family-leave-covid-

19-faqs (last visited October 14, 2022). Plaintiffs apparently take this

to mean that COVID-19 sick leave payments are wages for purposes

of NYLL § 191. But as the State of New York explained in its amicus

brief, that FAQ is not guidance regarding NYLL § 191, but more a

“shorthand to explain that the new quarantine leave payments should

be made on the same schedule and in the same manner as wages

subject to Labor Law § 191.” State of New York, Amicus Curiae Br. at




                                  65
24.

      Even if the NYDOL’s FAQ page were a more formal,

authoritative agency pronouncement entitled to deference, it more

strongly suggests that COVID-19 leave payments are benefits, not

wages.   The FAQ does not state that Leave Law payments are

“wages” as defined by § 191. Nor does the FAQ advise that an

employer violates § 191 if it fails to make Leave Law payments per

§ 191’s schedule. Rather, the FAQ suggests that COVID-19 leave

payments are benefits. In the very same FAQ upon which Plaintiffs

rely, the NYDOL titles a section “Benefits” and repeatedly uses the

word thereafter to explain what pay an individual is entitled to under

the Leave Law when subject to an order of quarantine or isolation.

See, e.g., Paid Family Leave FAQs (“How does this affect NY’s COVID-

19 quarantine leave benefits? . . . NY’s COVID-19 quarantine leave

benefits are only available during the order of quarantine or isolation.

. . . This new law provides benefits in cases where an individual is




                                  66
under     an     order    of    quarantine   –   either   mandatory    or

precautionary. . . .” (emphasis added)).

        Furthermore, in describing COVID-19 workplace regulations,

the NYDOL states the following:

        Former Governor Cuomo enacted a law that provides
        benefits – including sick leave, paid family leave, and
        disability benefits – to New York employees impacted by
        the mandatory or precautionary orders of quarantine or
        isolation due to COVID-19. These benefits do not have
        an expiration date. If your employer does not comply
        with this law, you have the right to file a complaint.

N.Y.    State,    Dep’t    of   Labor,    COVID-19    Paid   Sick   Leave,

https://dol.ny.gov (last visited October 14, 2022).

        An agency’s interpretation of a statute “is entitled to great

deference, particularly when that interpretation has been followed

consistently over a long period of time.” United States v. Clark, 

454U.S. 555, 565 (1982). As the district court explained, the NYDOL has

consistently instructed that paid sick leave is a “benefit[]” and that

there is “‘no “correct” or prescribed method’ of provision or

payment.” App’x at 149–50.



                                     67
       Finally, Plaintiffs do not perform any labor at JFK8 while under

mandatory or precautionary COVID-19 quarantine or isolation.

Therefore, the payments Plaintiffs are entitled to receive under the

Leave Law cannot be “wages” under NYLL § 191. See N.Y. Lab. Law

§ 190(1) (defining “wages” as “earnings for labor or services

rendered”). And because payments provided for under the Leave

Law are not “wages” for purposes of NYLL § 191, Plaintiffs do not

have a claim under NYLL § 191 for Amazon’s alleged violations of the

Leave Law.

III.   CONCLUSION

       In sum, we hold as follows:

       (1)   Plaintiffs’ public nuisance and NYLL § 200 claims are not

             moot.

       (2)   The doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply to

             Plaintiffs’ public nuisance or NYLL § 200 claims.




                                  68
      (3)   Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for public nuisance under

            New York law because they do not allege a special injury.

      (4)   Section 11 of the New York Workers’ Compensation Law

            does not preclude injunctive relief under NYLL § 200.

      (5)   Leave Law payments are not “wages” for purposes of

            NYLL § 191.

      We therefore AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’

public nuisance claim and NYLL § 191 claims for damages and

injunctive relief; and we VACATE the district court’s dismissal of

Plaintiffs’ NYLL § 200 claim seeking a declaratory judgment and

injunctive relief and REMAND to the district court for further

proceedings on that claim.

DENNY CHIN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:

             I agree with the majority's holdings that (1) Plaintiffs' public

nuisance and New York Labor Law (""NYLL"") § 200 claims are not moot, (2) the

primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply to those claims, (3) § 11 of the New

York Workers' Compensation Law does not preclude injunctive relief under

NYLL § 200, and (4) COVID-19 sick leave payments are not ""wages"" under NYLL

§ 191. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's conclusion that the

district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs' public nuisance claim. I would find

that the harm Plaintiffs faced was different in kind -- not just degree -- from that

faced by the community at large. Accordingly, I would conclude that Plaintiffs

adequately pleaded special injury to support their public nuisance claim.

             Under New York law, ""[a] cause of action for public nuisance 'exists

for conduct that amounts to a substantial interference with the exercise of a

common right,' such as 'endangering' the 'health or safety of a considerable

number of persons.'"" Benoit v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., 

959 F.3d491, 504 (2d Cir. 2020) (alterations omitted) (quoting 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet

Foods, Inc. v. Finlandia Ctr., Inc., 96 N.Y.2d 280, 292 (2001)). ""A 'public nuisance is

actionable by a private person only if it is shown that the person suffered special
injury beyond that suffered by the community at large.'"" Id. at 505 (quoting 532

Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc., 96 N.Y.2d at 292). ""The injury must be different

in 'kind,' not simply 'degree.'"" Id. (quoting 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc.,

96 N.Y.2d at 294); see Connecticut v. Am. Elec. Power Co., Inc., 582 F.3d 309, 367 (2d

Cir. 2009) (""It is not enough that he has suffered the same kind of harm or

interference but to a greater extent or degree.""), rev'd on other grounds, 

564 U.S.410 (2011). As the majority acknowledges, however, a “[d]ifference in degree of

interference cannot . . . be entirely disregarded in determining whether there has

been difference in kind.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821C, cmt. c.

             The majority observes that because all New Yorkers faced the risk of

contracting COVID-19, any injury suffered by Plaintiffs is one of a difference

only in degree, not in kind. I disagree. Plaintiffs are not alleging that the

generalized risk of contracting COVID-19 constitutes a public nuisance, but

rather that Amazon's conduct created a public nuisance that disproportionately

injured them. First, Plaintiffs faced heightened COVID-19 risks due to the

conditions of their employment. Second, they risked financial losses if they

dared to mitigate those conditions. The harms here -- employment conditions

and financial losses -- are different in kind from those the public faced because



                                          2
the community at large was not subjected to the conditions that the workers at

JFK8 endured. The public at large did not even enter JFK8.

               As alleged in the amended complaint (and assumed to be true for

purposes of this appeal), Plaintiffs faced conditions that significantly increased

their risk of contracting COVID-19 and were forced to face these heightened risks

under threat of discipline or termination. Amazon's demanding productivity

requirements at JFK8, an 840,000 square foot fulfillment center on Staten Island, 1

prevented workers from engaging in social distancing or basic hygiene and

sanitation practices. See, e.g., J. App'x at 108 ¶ 250 (workers ""fear taking the time

to clean their stations for fear it will result in a writeup for [productivity] issues);

id. at 109 ¶ 253 (because of changes to employee break schedules, ""bathroom

lines and break rooms are more crowded during the break time"").

               Moreover, Amazon implemented a contact-tracing plan that was

effectively inoperative, discouraged employees from informing their colleagues

if they had tested positive, and penalized workers who raised concerns about the

lack of COVID-19 safety protocols at the warehouse. See, e.g., J. App'x at 111




1 JFK8 operates 24 hours, seven days a week. On average, there are approximately 3,500 workers at one
time, but during peak seasons around the holidays or Amazon Prime Day in July, this number can
increase to 5,000 workers. See J. App'x at 88 ¶ 86; 127-28.
                                                   3
¶ 280 (Amazon's contact tracing system consisted ""entirely of reviewing

surveillance footage to monitor the workplace contacts of workers diagnosed

with COVID-19""); id. at 113 ¶ 290 (workers who tested positive were discouraged

from telling their coworkers and were given no guidance on how to ""monitor

their health at home, quarantine when not at work, or to seek medical advice"").

Though Amazon suspended the tracking requirements for the ""total time off

task"" (""TOT"") system in March 2020, workers were not informed until July 2020.

See id. at 106 ¶¶ 232-33 (Amazon instructed managers ""not to post the talking

points [about the change in TOT rate enforcement] publicly""). Until then, the

strict TOT system and the risk of termination forced Plaintiffs to continue

working in conditions that rendered them particularly susceptible to COVID-19.

See, e.g., id. at 107 ¶ 238 (the TOT system ""forced [workers] to work at a frenzied

pace""); id. at 108 ¶ 245 (the productivity requirements ""discourage[d] workers

from leaving their workstations to wash their hands and from taking the time to

wipe down their workstations"").

             Plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the threat of discipline or

termination if they failed to meet their productivity requirements kept them

confined to the hazardous environment inside JFK8. Warehouse workers were at



                                          4
particular risk of contracting COVID-19. First, warehouses often contained

thousands of employees working in ""cramped or tight spaces"" at high work rates

and talking at elevated volumes to overcome the din of machinery. Br. of Amici

Curiae Occupational Health Physicians et al. in support of Plaintiff-Appellants

(""Br. of Amici Curiae"") at 3-4. Such conditions increased the risk of transmission

of an airborne virus such as COVID-19 because employees were discouraged

from leaving their workstations to sanitize themselves after each potential

exposure. Id. This heightened risk was exacerbated where, as here, workers

were deprived of preventative safety measures and were unable to easily access

sick leave, resulting in an increased risk of infecting their coworkers and families.

             Plaintiffs lacked the autonomy to avoid the hazardous conditions

arising from Amazon's conduct. And unlike many members of the public,

Plaintiffs were not permitted to work remotely. If anything, because the demand

for packages increased during the pandemic, they had even less flexibility in that

respect. See, e.g., J. App'x at 88 ¶ 87 (Amazon said it hired 175,000 new workers

in April 2020, many of whom were ""temporary workers hired to meet increased

demand during the pandemic"").




                                          5
             At the end of each nearly 11-hour shift working under these

conditions, Plaintiffs would then take the increased risk of infection home to

their families. While Amazon may have created an indirect harm to the public in

the form of community spread, its practices directly endangered Plaintiffs in the

workplace and further endangered the communities with whom Plaintiffs

interacted. See Br. of Amici Curiae at 24. Plaintiffs Chandler and Bernard

contracted COVID-19 while working at JFK8, and Chandler's cousin, with whom

she lived, died during that time from the disease. The physical and emotional

injuries that followed were distinct from those the community faced because

they arose proximately from Amazon's conduct.

             Plaintiffs also suffered economic harm not suffered by members of

the public because they faced loss of pay and sick leave. See, e.g., J. App'x at 92

¶¶ 120-24 (workers felt ""increased pressure to attend work while sick"" because

they feared losing the opportunity to accrue limited unpaid leave time); id. at 89

¶ 98 (Amazon retaliated against workers who spoke out about workplace safety

and COVID-19). New York courts have long recognized that economic harm can

be a sufficient special injury for a private plaintiff to maintain a public nuisance

claim. See 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc., 96 N.Y.2d at 293 (private right of



                                          6
action where public nuisance ""had a devastating effect on [plaintiffs'] ability to

earn a living""). Further, ""[o]n the matter of special damage . . . there is no

requirement that there be directness of such damage, or that there be any

particular quantum, before there is a right to a private remedy, such as

injunction."" Graceland Corp. v. Consol. Laundries Corp., 180 N.Y.S.2d 644, 648
(1958), aff'd, 6 N.Y.2d 900 (1959). Defendants made it difficult for workers who

tested positive for COVID-19 to obtain sick leave and allegedly did not pay the

full amount of COVID-19 sick pay.

             Constrained by the demanding requirements of the TOT system,

Plaintiffs were faced with an unenviable choice: continue working in a

dangerous and demanding work environment or avoid it to protect their health

but face a high likelihood of losing their jobs. Although it is true, as the majority

observes, that many New Yorkers suffered financial losses as a result of the

pandemic, the losses Plaintiffs allege are different in kind because they resulted

from Amazon's affirmative decisions not to implement any sufficient measures

to mitigate the high risk of COVID-19 transmission inherent in warehouse work.

See, e.g., Br. of Amici Curiae at 7 (due to ""certain environmental design

characteristics that make social distancing difficult [in warehouses], . . . it [is] all



                                            7
the more important that employers implement all mitigation measures to

prevent COVID-19 infection."").

            Plaintiffs have thus plausibly pleaded special injury that they faced a

heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19 and threat of economic harm because

of conditions at JFK8. Thus, I would hold that the lower court erred in

dismissing Plaintiffs' public nuisance claim.

                                Case No. CV-22-967669


                                            Appearances:

                 Nick Iannetta, pro se.

                 Steptoe & Johnson PLLC and Dallas F. Kratzer III, for
                 appellee.


MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J.:

                   Plaintiff-appellant Nick Iannetta (“Iannetta”), pro se, appeals the trial

court’s order granting defendant-appellee Amazon Inc.’s (“Amazon”) motion to

dismiss. For the following reasons, we affirm.
Factual and Procedural History

               Iannetta’s lawsuit stems from his sale of paperback and eBooks

through Authorhouse, a third-party publishing company, who listed and sold the

books on Amazon. Iannetta disputes whether his Authorhouse account accurately

reflects the number of books sold on Amazon. Specifically, Iannetta argues that

Amazon’s website shows it has more books available for sale than the number of

books sold to Amazon through Authorhouse. Iannetta also argues that Amazon lists

him as an Amazon bestseller, which denotes sales of at least 3,000 books, but

Iannetta’s Authorhouse account reflects the sale of fewer books. The record does

not demonstrate whether Iannetta executed contracts with Authorhouse or Amazon.

               In or around May 2018, Iannetta initiated arbitration proceedings in

Ohio against Authorhouse. Pursuant to those proceedings, a subpoena was issued,

at Iannetta’s request, to Amazon in Washington state seeking (1) a record, printout,

or report stating the number of copies Amazon sold of Iannetta’s book titled “2015

Top Pro Football Prospects Scouting Reports” and (2) a statement, printout, or

report that reflected the number of new and used copies of the book that Amazon

had for sale. On June 22, 2018, Amazon filed objections to the subpoena and

Iannetta allegedly did not respond to those objections.1 Amazon did not provide the

information requested in the subpoena. Iannetta claims that without the requested

information from Amazon he was forced to “waive” the arbitration proceedings.



      1 The record does not include any documents from Iannetta’s 2018 action other than

a copy of Amazon’s objections to the subpoena.
              Approximately four years later, on August 19, 2022, Iannetta filed a

complaint in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-22-967669 against Amazon titled “pre-suit

complaint for discovery.” The complaint reads verbatim:

      Amazon denied the arbitration subpoena in Cleveland Municipal Court
      to obtain sales results for the paperback book and e-book from the first
      day the book went on sale on amazon, and I was not able to complete
      the arbitration with Authorhouse and the arbitration was waived. If
      Amazon intentionally did not notify Authorhouse of all the books sold
      on amazon or hid book sales from Authorhouse which would have
      prevented Authorhouse from paying me my royalties, I would expect to
      be paid compensatory damages, attorney fees, court costs, and punitive
      damages from amazon. Therefore, I was not able to receive money
      from amazon through Authorhouse for the books sold on Amazon. I
      am also entitled to any other monetary relief at law and in equity from
      Amazon.

      Objective: Is to obtain sales results from amazon for the paperback
      book and e-book from the first day the book went on sale on amazon.

      The number of used and new paperback books that were up for sale
      on amazon is more than the number of paperback books recorded sold
      in the author house account. Amazon indicated that I sold e-books,
      and this is significant because not one amazon electronic book is
      recorded sold in my Authorhouse account. Both the e-book version
      and paperback version are listed as amazon bestsellers on amazon.
      For the paperback and e-book versions, the minimum number of
      books sold by an author to qualify as an amazon bestseller is 3,000
      books. I expect the number of books sold on amazon to be higher than
      that since the paperback and e-book versions sales ranks are ranked
      much higher than that.

      At the time, the paperback sold for $35 and the e-book sold for $20. I
      never saw any amazon account statement. It sure seems like more
      books are sold on amazon than the number of books Authorhouse
      reported sold on amazon.

      I am requesting a one page transaction summary of all books sold on
      amazon from the first day the book went on sale on Amazon. I was
      not able to obtain the appropriate sales information from
      Authorhouse.
      What facts do you know about the case?

      How many paperback books did Amazon sell from the first day the
      book went on sale on Amazon?
      ISBN-10: 1524602639 and 13: 9781524602635

      How many e-books did Amazon sell from the first day the book went
      on sale on Amazon? Former ASIN Number: B01EFU8HVY (Now has a
      new ASIN number)

Complaint, August 19, 2022. Attached to the complaint are printouts from various

book sellers’ websites that advertise Iannetta’s book for sale and a royalty report

from an unknown source that reflects the sale of six copies of Iannetta’s book.

              The complaint was served on Amazon in January 2023. On February

2, 2023, Amazon filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Civ.R.

12(B)(6). The motion to dismiss was unopposed, and the trial court summarily

granted the motion on February 22, 2023.

              On March 24, 2023, Iannetta filed a timely appeal, presenting this

assignment of error for our review: “The trial court did [err] granting Amazon’s

motion to dismiss.”

Legal Analysis

              Iannetta argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed his

discovery lawsuit filed pursuant to R.C. 2317.48 seeking the exact number of his

books that Amazon had sold. Amazon disputes that Iannetta filed a discovery

complaint merely seeking discovery. Amazon argues that the trial court properly

dismissed Iannetta’s complaint because (1) Ohio does not recognize an independent
cause of action to enforce or seek damages relating to a subpoena and, (2)

alternatively, assuming an independent cause of action to seek damages stemming

from a subpoena was available, the action must fail because the subpoena in

question was invalid and unenforceable.        We find that regardless of whether

Iannetta’s complaint was meant to initiate a lawsuit or obtain discovery under R.C.

2317.48, the trial court did not err when it granted Amazon’s motion to dismiss.

               A Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on

which relief can be granted “is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint.”

State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs., 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605

N.E.2d 378 (1992), citing Assn. for Defense of Washington Local School Dist. v.

Kiger, 42 Ohio St.3d 116, 117, 537 N.E.2d 1292 (1989). We review a dismissal

pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) de novo. Perrysburg Twp. v. Rossford, 

103 Ohio St.3d79, 2004-Ohio-4362, 814 N.E.2d 44, ¶ 5.

               In our review of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, we must accept

the material allegations of the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences

in favor of the plaintiff. Jenkins v. Cleveland, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104768, 2017-

Ohio-1054, ¶ 8, citing Johnson v. Microsoft Corp., 106 Ohio St.3d 278, 2005-Ohio-

4985, 834 N.E.2d 791, ¶ 6. For a party to ultimately prevail on the motion, it must

appear from the face of the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that

would justify a trial court granting relief. Jenkins at id., citing O’Brien v. Univ.

Community Tenants Union, Inc., 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 245, 327 N.E.2d 753 (1975).
               The basis of Iannetta’s complaint is not readily discernible. Initially,

we review the complaint under the most likely premise that Iannetta filed a

discovery complaint in accordance with R.C. 2317.48. Although the pleading does

not reference the statute, it is titled “pre-suit complaint for discovery” and seeks the

answers to three interrogatory questions.

               R.C. 2317.48 allows a party to obtain discovery prior to filing a

complaint, and provides:

      When a person claiming to have a cause of action or a defense to an
      action commenced against him, without the discovery of a fact from the
      adverse party, is unable to file his complaint or answer, he may bring
      an action for discovery, setting forth in his complaint in the action for
      discovery the necessity and the grounds for the action, with any
      interrogatories relating to the subject matter of the discovery that are
      necessary to procure the discovery sought. Unless a motion to dismiss
      the action is filed under Civil Rule 12, the complaint shall be fully and
      directly answered under oath by the defendant. Upon the final
      disposition of the action, the costs of the action shall be taxed in the
      manner the court deems equitable.

               “An action for discovery is to be used only to uncover facts necessary

for pleading, not to gather proof to support a claim or to determine whether a cause

of action exists.” Huge v. Ford Motor Co., 155 Ohio App.3d 730, 2004-Ohio-232,

803 N.E.2d 859, ¶ 10 (8th Dist.), citing Marsalis v. Wilson, 149 Ohio App.3d 637,

2002-Ohio-5534, 778 N.E.2d 612 (2d Dist.). “This form of action occupies a small

niche between an unacceptable ‘fishing expedition’ and a short and plain statement

of a complaint or a defense filed pursuant to the Civil Rules.” Poulos v. Parker

Sweeper Co., 44 Ohio St.3d 124, 127, 541 N.E.2d 1031 (1989). In other words, R.C.

2317.48 provides “a ‘satisfactory middle course’ for litigants who require additional
facts in order to sufficiently file a valid complaint, but who already have enough

factual basis for their assertions that the discovery process would not be turned into

a ‘fishing expedition.’” Fasteners for Retail v. Peck, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 70818,

1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 1334, 3 (Apr. 3, 1997), citing Poulos at 126. “Broad assertions

of potential claims will not suffice; instead, ‘[i]t must be clear to the court what the

underlying claim is about.’” TILR Corp. v. TalentNow, LLC, 1st Dist. Hamilton No.

C-220323, 2023-Ohio-1345, ¶ 19, quoting Colegate v. Lohbeck, 

78 Ohio App.3d 727,730, 605 N.E.2d 1301 (1st Dist.1992).

                Here, Iannetta’s discovery complaint asked what facts Amazon knew

about the case and how many of Iannetta’s books Amazon sold since it first listed his

book for sale. Iannetta sought information to determine if he had a cause of action

against Amazon rather than requesting information to clarify a specific fact.

Iannetta sought information that is exactly what Poulos described as a fishing

expedition and is not permitted under R.C. 2317.48. Thus, Iannetta did not raise a

justiciable cause of action against Amazon and discovery was not permissible per

R.C. 2317.48.

                Alternatively, assuming Iannetta filed a complaint to initiate a lawsuit

as argued by Amazon, the pleading failed to state a claim upon which relief could be

granted. A plain reading of the complaint indicates Iannetta alleged if Amazon failed

to notify Authorhouse of the actual number of Iannetta’s books it had sold on its

website, Amazon owed Iannetta compensatory and punitive damages, attorney fees,
and court costs. It is unclear whether Iannetta’s allegations are based upon a

contract dispute or a deficiency related to the subpoena.

               To state a claim for breach-of-contract, the plaintiff must allege (1)

the existence of a binding contract, (2) the nonbreaching party performed his or her

contractual obligations, (3) the other party failed to fulfill its contractual obligations

without legal excuse, and (4) the nonbreaching party suffered damages as a result of

the breach. Cynergies Consulting, Inc. v. Wheeler, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90225,

2008-Ohio-3362, ¶ 15, citing All Star Land Title Agency, Inc. v. Surewin Invest.,

Inc., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87569, 2006-Ohio-5729. Iannetta failed to reference

or attach a contract — either with Authorhouse or Amazon — in support of his

allegations and did not state that he performed any contractual obligations. Absent

such allegations, Iannetta’s complaint failed to state a claim for breach of contract

upon which relief could be granted. Further, if the complaint sought compliance

with Iannetta’s previously issued subpoena — as argued by Amazon — Iannetta did

not identify such a cause of action or reference a relevant statute, code section, or

case law in support of such an allegation.

               Accordingly, Iannetta’s complaint did not state a claim upon which

relief could be granted and his assignment of error is overruled.

               Judgment affirmed.

      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.

      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.
      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the

common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.

      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27

of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

[*1]David Solomon, Plaintiff-Appellant,

v

Amazon.com, Inc. et al., Defendants-Respondents, Froebel Chungata, etc., et al., Defendants.



David Solomon, appellant pro se.
The Chartwell Law Offices, LLP, White Plains (Carmen A. Nicolaou of counsel), for respondents.
Order, Supreme Court, Bronx County (Paul L. Alpert, J.), entered on or about September 15, 2022, which granted the motion of defendants The Chartwell Law Offices LLP, Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market Group Inc., Carmen Nicolaou, individually and as lawyer employed by The Chartwell Law Offices LLP, and Jay Warren, individually (WFM/Chartwell defendants) to dismiss the complaint, unanimously affirmed, without costs.
Order, same court and Justice, entered on or about April 26, 2023, which, insofar as appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied as moot the following nine motions brought by plaintiff: a motion to strike defendants' reply on their motion to dismiss, two motions to find defendants guilty of perjury, a motion to deny defendants' cross-motion for sanctions, a motion to add a case citation to the prior motion to strike, a motion to transfer the case to the Appellate Division, a motion for a default judgment pursuant to CPLR 3126, a motion to compel defendants to admit transfer to the Appellate Division, and a motion to reverse plaintiff's suspension from the practice of law, unanimously affirmed, without costs.
The motion court properly dismissed the complaint as against the WFM/Chartwell defendants. Plaintiff purports to assert a claim under 42 USC §§ 1983 and 1985 for deprivation of his constitutional rights to cross-examine the underlying anonymous complainants in a discrimination proceeding he initiated with the New York State Division of Human Rights and to ""a judgment that is not based entirely on the[ir] hearsay accusations."" This claim must fail because plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that any such rights (to the extent they exist) were violated here, that the WFM/Chartwell defendants acted under color of state law, or the existence of a conspiracy involving these defendants.
Having dismissed the complaint as against the WFM/Chartwell defendants, the motion court properly denied plaintiff's various motions aimed at those defendants as moot.

[*1]The People of the State of New York, etc., Plaintiff-Respondent,

v

Amazon.com., et al., Defendants-Appellants, HR Policy Association, Amicus Curiae, The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, Amicus curiae.



Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, Washington, D.C. (Jason C. Schwartz of the bar of the District of Columbia and State of Maryland, admitted pro hac vice, of counsel), for appellants.
Letitia James, Attorney General, New York (Ester Murdukhayeva of counsel), for respondent.
Fisher & Phillips LLP, New York (Seth Kaufman, G. Roger King and Gregory Hoff of counsel), for HR Policy Association, amicus curiae.
Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, New York (Jennifer L. Bloom and Shawn Patrick Regan of counsel), for The Chambers of Commerce of the United States of America, amicus curiae.
Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Nancy M. Bannon, J.), entered on or about October 18, 2021, which, insofar as appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, unanimously reversed, on the law, and the motion granted. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.
The complaint alleges that defendants (collectively, Amazon) repeatedly and persistently failed to institute reasonable health and safety measures at its facilities (the JFK8 fulfillment center and the DBK1 delivery station) during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect its workers from COVID-19, in violation of Labor Law § 200, and retaliated against workers who raised related complaints about safety conditions, in violation of Labor Law §§ 215 and 740.
Contrary to the motion court, we find that the Labor Law §§ 215 and 740 claims alleging retaliation against workers based, in part, on their participation in protests against unsafe working conditions plainly relate to the workers' participation in ""concerted activities for the purpose of . . . mutual aid or protection,"" i.e., activities that are protected by the NLRA (Hoesten v Best, 34 AD3d 143, 154 [1st Dept 2006]), and therefore that the claims are preempted (see San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, Millmen's Union, Local 2020 v Garmon, 359 US 236, 242-243 [1959]). Where conduct is clearly protected or prohibited by the NLRA, the NLRB, and not the states, should serve as the forum for disputes arising out of the conduct (id.). As no exception to Garmon preemption, including the local interest exception, applies to claims that are clearly covered by the NLRA (see Brown v Hotel & Rest. Empls. & Bartenders Intl. Union Local 54, 468 US 491, 502-503 [1984]), these claims must be dismissed with no further analysis.
Even if the claims were only ""arguably protected"" by the NLRA and therefore application of the local interest exception was not foreclosed (see id.), and even assuming the State made a sufficient showing of a ""'deeply rooted'"" State interest in protecting employees against retaliation for protesting workplace safety conditions under its police powers that might, in some circumstances, be a basis for an exception from Garmon preemption (see Brown, 468 US at 502-503), the exception would not properly be applied in this case. There is a proceeding pending before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) involving essentially the same allegations of retaliation, and the possibility of inconsistent rulings on the same issue poses an ""obvious and substantial"" ""risk of interference with the [NLRB's] jurisdiction"" (Local 926, Intl. Union of Operating Engrs., AFL-CIO v Jones, 460 US 669, 682-683 [1983]).
The Labor Law § 200 claim seeking a permanent injunction requiring Amazon to undertake policies consistent with COVID-19 workplace guidelines issued by the State must be dismissed as moot, as the State has withdrawn the public health guidance that the claim seeks to enforce, including [*2]by prospective injunctive relief.

In this interlocutory appeal, the employee contends she injured her right knee and both
ankles when she fell off a motorized scooter while at work. The employer initially
authorized certain medical treatment, but it later declined to approve the authorized treating
physician’s referral to an orthopedic specialist or provide a panel of orthopedic physicians,
repeatedly insisting that the employee must attend an examination with a physician of the
employer’s choice first. The employee refused, and the employer filed a motion to compel
the examination. Following a hearing, the court granted the motion but ordered the
employer to honor the orthopedic referral made by the authorized physician before the
employer’s examination could proceed. The employer has appealed. Upon careful review
of the record and consideration of the pertinent statutory language, we affirm the trial
court’s order and remand the case.
Judge Pele I. Godkin delivered the opinion of the Appeals Board in which Presiding Judge
Timothy W. Conner and Judge Meredith B. Weaver joined.
Kristen C. Stevenson, Knoxville, Tennessee, for the employer-appellant, Amazon.com
David B. Weatherman, Franklin, Tennessee for the employee-appellee, Sabrina Rooks
                             Factual and Procedural History
      On May 29, 2024, Sabrina Rooks (“Employee”) was working for Amazon.com
(“Employer”) when she fell from a knee scooter and reported sustaining several injuries.
Employee was using a scooter due to a non-work-related injury and asserted she “was
walking in the Amazon warehouse when debris caused my knee scooter to slip out from
                                              1
under me. I fell and felt immediate severe pain in [my] foot, ankle, and knee.” 1 Employee
reported the incident to Employer and testified that she was advised to go to the emergency
room because AmCare, Employer’s on-site medical facility, was closed. 2
       Thereafter, Employee was seen at AmCare and provided Employer with paperwork
from her emergency room visit. At that time, Employee was offered a panel of physicians,
although she did not immediately select a provider from the panel because she wanted to
continue treating with Dr. Christopher Jones, the doctor who was treating her non-work-
related injury. Employee also claimed that she did not understand the panel process and
that certain adjusters allegedly told her she could seek treatment with Dr. Jones. When
Employee saw Dr. Jones the following month, however, Employee was informed that he
“couldn’t do anything[] when he found out it was workers’ comp.” Employer, for its part,
argued that Employee refused to be treated by a panel physician for “approximately five
weeks” and that her visit with Dr. Jones in June was unauthorized.
        Employee selected Concentra and Dr. Frank Thomas from an Employer-provided
panel in June. She was first seen by Dr. Thomas on July 3, 2024, who diagnosed a right
distal fracture of the fibula. In medical documentation Employee provided to Employer,
Dr. Thomas marked that Employee’s injury was “work-related.” At that time, Dr. Thomas
also assigned work restrictions and referred Employee to Dr. Jones, the orthopedic surgeon
Employee had already been seeing, for additional treatment. Instead of authorizing this
direct referral or providing a panel of alternative specialists, however, Employer proceeded
to schedule an employer’s examination with Dr. Jeffrey Hazlewood, which Employee
declined to attend. Dr. Thomas made additional referrals to Dr. Jones on August 5, 8, 19,
and 21. Employer did not approve the referrals and eventually suspended Employee’s
benefits due to “medical noncompliance as she would not attend the [employer’s
examination].”
          Employee filed a PBD on August 28, 2024, stating that
          My [authorized treating physician] Dr. Frank Thomas referred me to Ortho
          Dr. Christopher Jones, but Employer will not schedule an appointment with
          him, nor have I been provided a panel of Orthos. I was let go from my job
          on August 22, 2024, and am totally disabled from working, but I have not
          been paid any TTD.

  There is conflicting information in the record as to where Employee’s fall occurred. In her petition for
benefit determination (“PBD”), Employee stated she was “[w]alking out to her car” and that her fall was
caused by debris; however, in her Rule 72 Declaration, Employee stated she was “walking in the Amazon
warehouse” when the incident occurred. In her deposition, Employee testified that she was “walking
through an area” when she fell. The trial court’s order references a fall in the parking lot.
2
    No medical records of an emergency room visit are included in the record.
                                                      2
In her petition, Employee alleged injuries to her right knee, right ankle, and left knee. In
December, in conjunction with her request for an expedited hearing, Employee attached a
Rule 72 declaration and Employer’s “Healthcare Provider Request for Information Form,”
which was signed by Dr. Thomas. In her declaration, Employee stated that no appointment
was scheduled with Dr. Jones despite several referrals. Moreover, on August 15, Employer
asked her to submit to an employer’s examination with Dr. Hazlewood.
       In January 2025, a dispute certification notice (“DCN”) was issued that identified
compensability, medical benefits, and temporary disability benefits as disputed issues.
Employer also raised additional defenses on the DCN, asserting that some or all of
Employee’s claimed injuries are “related to a pre-existing condition and/or subsequent
intervening event and not an accidental injury arising primarily out of employment” and
are “idiopathic and not related to a hazard incident to employment.” On February 12,
Employer notified Employee it had scheduled an appointment with Dr. Hazlewood in
March, but Employee indicated she would not attend that appointment until Employer
authorized an appointment with Dr. Jones. On February 14, Employer filed a motion to
compel Employee’s examination by Dr. Hazlewood. In her response to the motion,
Employee requested that the court order Employer to provide treatment with Dr. Jones as
outlined in her request for an expedited hearing.
       The court addressed the motion to compel at the March 3, 2025 expedited hearing.
The court focused on sworn statements and testimony offered by Employee in support of
her position that Dr. Thomas was selected from an Employer-provided panel and that Dr.
Thomas initiated a direct referral to Dr. Jones. Moreover, the court emphasized that
Employer had offered the adjuster’s “unsworn and unauthenticated emails dated several
weeks later” in support of its argument that Employee had refused panels of physicians, a
position the court ultimately concluded was not supported by the evidence. In finding that
Employer’s refusal to honor the direct referral or otherwise offer a panel of specialists was
unreasonable, the court stressed that the emails Employer offered into evidence were
circulated three weeks after Employee saw Dr. Thomas, the authorized doctor, who made
the direct referral to Dr. Jones. Thereafter, the court noted that Dr. Thomas made four
additional referrals, none of which were honored. 3
       Employer argued that it refused to authorize the direct referral to Dr. Jones because
Employee was medically non-compliant, asserting that Employee initially refused to select
a doctor from a panel. In its order, the court noted that Employee had testified she did not
understand the panel requirement and eventually “changed course on July 3.” It
determined she was compliant from that date forward and, although she initially refused
Employer’s request for an employer examination in July, Employer “did not renew its
request on this record until February – seven months after the specialist referral.” The
court considered the delay “troubling” and pointed to mandatory language in Tennessee
3
 The court determined that Employee’s visits to the emergency room and her visit to Dr. Jones in June
were also authorized because each visit was approved by her adjuster or a representative of Employer.
                                                 3
Code Annotated section 50-6-204(a)(3)(A)(ii), which states that, in circumstances where
an authorized physician refers the employee to a specific physician, “[t]he employer shall
be deemed to have accepted the referral” unless the employer provides a panel of alternate
specialists within three business days.
       Ultimately, the court determined that Employer had offered nothing to justify its
refusal either to schedule an appointment with Dr. Jones or to offer a panel of specialists
despite five separate referrals from Dr. Thomas. The court stressed that an authorized
treating physician’s referral is not conditioned on whether an employee agrees to undergo
an employer’s examination. As a result, the court ordered Employer to honor the referral
and also ordered Employee to attend an employer’s examination “after the statutorily
mandated appointment with Dr. Jones.” 4 Employer has appealed.
                                         Standard of Review
       The standard we apply in reviewing the trial court’s decision presumes that the
court’s factual findings are correct unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.
See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-239(c)(7) (2024). When the trial judge has had the
opportunity to observe a witness’s demeanor and to hear in-court testimony, we give
considerable deference to factual findings made by the trial court. Madden v. Holland Grp.
of Tenn., Inc., 277 S.W.3d 896, 898 (Tenn. 2009). However, “[n]o similar deference need
be afforded the trial court’s findings based upon documentary evidence.” Goodman v.
Schwarz Paper Co., No. W2016-02594-SC-R3-WC, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 8, at *6 (Tenn.
Workers’ Comp. Panel Jan. 18, 2018). Moreover, the interpretation and application of
statutes and regulations are questions of law that are reviewed de novo with no presumption
of correctness afforded the trial court’s conclusions. See Batey v. Deliver This, Inc., 568 S.W.3d 91, 95-96 (Tenn. 2019). We are also mindful of our obligation to construe the
workers’ compensation statutes “fairly, impartially, and in accordance with basic principles
of statutory construction” and in a way that does not favor either the employee or the
employer. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-116 (2024).
                                                Analysis
       On appeal, Employer asserts “the trial court erred and abused its discretion by
placing a limitation on Employer’s statutory right to an IME and finding that Employer’s
entitlement to an IME was subject to Amazon’s first honoring a referral to orthopedist
Christopher Jones before the IME could proceed.” Specifically, Employer argues that the
court improperly applied Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-204 and failed to give
“proper weight” to the statutory language that an employee “must submit to examination
4
  Although not relevant to the appeal in this case, the trial court also referred Employer to the Compliance
Program for investigation pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-118(a)(8) for Employer’s
failure to timely provide reasonable and necessary medical treatment recommended by the authorized
treating physician.
                                                     4
by the employer’s physician at all reasonable times.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-204(d)(1)
(2024). Conversely, Employee asserts the court did not err and properly ordered Employer
to comply with the referral of the authorized treating physician from July 2024 before she
would be required to attend the employer examination with Dr. Hazlewood.
        In general, we agree with Employer’s assertion that an injured worker must attend
an employer’s examination “at all reasonable times” during the course of a claim. Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-204(d)(1). In the present case, however, Employer’s right to obtain an
employer’s examination is not disputed. In fact, the court granted Employer’s motion to
compel Employee to attend an examination with Dr. Hazlewood and noted that, pursuant
to section 50-6-204(d)(1), an “injured employee must submit to examination by the
employer’s physician at all reasonable times if requested to do so by the employer.”
(Emphasis added.) The court, citing our previous decision in King v. Big Binder Express,
LLC, No. 2016-07-0378, 2016 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 92, at *9 (Tenn. Workers’
Comp. App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2016), also stressed, however, that “an employer’s right to an
examination of an employee pursuant to section 50-6-204(d)(1) by a physician of the
employer’s choosing is not without limits. Both by statute and case law, the employer’s
request must be reasonable.” As the trial court noted, the employer’s request must be made
at a “reasonable time” and “be reasonable, as a whole, in light of the surrounding
circumstances.” Citing id. at *10-11 (emphasis in original). Furthermore, as we have
stated numerous times, “a trial court has the necessary discretion to control the pace of
litigation through the use of case supervision and docket management.” Valladares v.
Transco Products, Inc., Nos. 2015-01-0117 & -0118, 2016 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd.
LEXIS 31, at *26 (Tenn. Workers’ Comp. App. Bd. July 27, 2016).
        In the case at hand, it is undisputed that during Employee’s first visit with her panel-
selected, authorized treating physician on July 3, 2024, Dr. Thomas made a direct referral
to Dr. Jones, an orthopedic surgeon. Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 50-6-
204(a)(3)(A)(ii), Employer had three business days after receiving that referral to either
authorize the referral or offer a panel of alternative specialists. It did neither. Instead,
Employer attempted to schedule an employer’s examination with Dr. Hazlewood, which
Employee declined to attend. Subsequently, the following month, Dr. Thomas made four
additional referrals, but it was not until February 2025, seven months after the original
referral, that Employer filed its motion to compel Employee’s attendance at the
appointment with Dr. Hazlewood. In short, the trial court determined that both parties bear
certain obligations and that Employer must comply with its statutorily-mandated obligation
to authorize a referral for treatment before Employee will be compelled to appear for its
employer’s examination. Under the circumstances of this case, we agree.
                                         Conclusion
        For the foregoing reasons, the trial court’s order is affirmed in its entirety, and the
case is remanded. Costs on appeal are taxed to Employer.

           IN RE VOLT ELECTRICITY PROVIDER, LP, Relator


            Original Proceeding on Petition for Writ of Mandamus


                          MEMORANDUM OPINION

      Relator, Volt Electricity Provider, LP, has filed a petition for a writ of

mandamus challenging the trial court’s order denying its plea to the jurisdiction and

its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction which asserted that the

claims of real party in interest, Dalal Said, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Public Utility Commission (the “PUC”) pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory

Act.1

        We deny relator’s petition for writ of mandamus.2

        Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is only available in limited

circumstances. See Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40 (Tex. 1992).

“Mandamus relief is available only if the trial court clearly abused its discretion and

the party has no adequate remedy by appeal.” In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 

35 S.W.3d602, 605 (Tex. 2000). Generally, mandamus relief is not available to correct

incidental trial court rulings where there is a remedy by appeal, including the

granting or denial of a plea to the jurisdiction. See In re Entergy Corp., 

142 S.W.3d316, 320 (Tex. 2004). However, Texas law recognizes an exception to this general

rule, allowing mandamus review of a trial court’s order denying a plea to the

jurisdiction where a party has failed to exhaust administrative remedies before the

PUC because “permitting a trial to go forward would interfere with the important

legislatively mandated function and purpose of the PUC.” Id. at 321; see also In re

Tex.-N.M. Power Co., No. 10-19-00166-CV, 2019 WL 3822274, at *2 (Tex. App.—

Waco Aug. 14, 2019, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.).


1
        See TEX. UTIL. CODE § 11.001 et seq.
2
        The underlying case is Dalal Said, on behalf of herself and all others similarly
        situated v. Volt Electricity Provider, LP, Cause No. 2020-13088, in the 215th
        District Court of Harris County, Texas, the Honorable Elaine Palmer presiding.

                                            2
      While this exception applies here, the burden to establish an abuse of

discretion by the trial court remains with relator, who must show that the trial court

has reached a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and

prejudicial error of law by its failure to analyze or apply the law correctly. See In re

Olshan Found. Repair Co., 328 S.W.3d 883, 888 (Tex. 2010). We conclude that

relator has not demonstrated that the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in

denying relator’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss.

      Accordingly, we deny relator’s petition for writ of mandamus. See TEX. R.

APP. P. 52.8(a), (d). All pending motions are dismissed as moot.

                                   PER CURIAM
Panel consists of Justices Goodman, Landau, and Adams.

 Judge Pamela K. Chen, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
1

New York, sitting by designation. 

                                                        1 
       
      Plaintiffs, a group of electrical generators and trade groups of electrical 
generators, appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Caproni, J.) granting Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) 
motions to dismiss.  Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of New York’s Zero 
Emissions Credit (“ZEC”) program, which subsidizes qualifying nuclear power 
plants with “ZECs”: state‐created and state‐issued credits certifying the zero‐
emission attributes of electricity produced by a participating nuclear plant. 

      Plaintiffs argue that the program is preempted under the Federal Power 
Act (“FPA”) and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause.  We conclude as 
follows: (1) the ZEC program is not field preempted because Plaintiffs have 
failed to identify an impermissible “tether” under Hughes v. Talen Energy 
Marketing, LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1293 (2016), between the ZEC program and 
wholesale market participation; (2) the ZEC program is not conflict preempted 
because Plaintiffs have failed to identify any clear damage to federal goals; and 
(3) Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to raise a dormant Commerce Clause claim.  
Affirmed.

DENNIS JACOBS, Circuit Judge: 
 
       Plaintiffs, a group of electrical generators and trade groups of electrical 
generators, appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (Caproni, J.) granting Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) 
motions to dismiss.  In August 2016, the New York Public Service Commission 
(“PSC”) adopted the Zero Emissions Credit (“ZEC”) program as part of a larger 
energy reform plan to reduce greenhouse‐gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030.  
The program subsidizes qualifying nuclear power plants by creating “ZECs”: 
state‐created and state‐issued credits certifying the zero‐emission attributes of 
electricity produced by a participating nuclear plant.  The PSC has determined 
that three nuclear power plants (FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point) qualify 
for the ZEC program; other facilities, including facilities located outside New 
York, may be selected in the future. 
 
       Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program influences the prices that result 
from the wholesale auction system established by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (“FERC”) and distorts the market mechanism for determining 
which energy generators should close.  Plaintiffs challenge the program’s 
constitutionality on two grounds: that the program is preempted under the 
Federal Power Act (“FPA”) and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause.  



                                        5 
Defendants, who are members of the PSC, and Intervenors, who are the nuclear 
generators (and their owners, including Exelon Corporation) receiving ZECs, 
moved to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack a private cause of action to 
pursue their preemption claims because the FPA implicitly forecloses equity 
jurisdiction, and that (in any event) Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law. 
 
       We conclude that the ZEC program is not field preempted, because 
Plaintiffs have failed to identify an impermissible “tether” under Hughes v. 
Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1293 (2016) between the ZEC 
program and wholesale market participation; that the ZEC program is not 
conflict preempted, because Plaintiffs have failed to identify any clear damage to 
federal goals; and that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing as to the dormant 
Commerce Clause claim.  These conclusions are consistent with the recent 
Seventh Circuit decision in Elec. Power Supply Assʹn v. Star, No. 17‐2433, 2018 
WL 4356683, at *1 (7th Cir. Sept. 13, 2018). 
 
       The judgment of the district court is affirmed. 
        
                                            I 
                                              
                                            A 
 
       The FPA establishes a collaborative scheme between the states and federal 
government to regulate electricity generation.  States have exclusive jurisdiction 
over “facilities used for the generation of electric energy,” including production 
and retail sales.  16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1).  FERC regulates electricity sales at 
wholesale, ensuring “rates and charges made, demanded, or received . . . for or 
in connection with” such sales are “just and reasonable.”  Id. § 824d(a). 
        
       FERC has determined that just and reasonable rates for wholesale 
electricity should be set by competitive auctions.  The New York Independent 
System Operator (“NYISO”) manages two types of wholesale auctions under 
FERC‐approved rules and procedures: energy and capacity.  In energy auctions, 
generators bid the lowest price they will accept to sell a given quantity of 
electrical output; in capacity auctions, generators bid (and NYISO purchases) 
options to call upon the generator to produce a specified quantity of electricity in 



                                         6 
the future.  Both types of auction employ “stacking” of bids from lowest to 
highest price until demand is satisfied.  App’x 50, 54 (Compl. ¶¶ 33, 39‐40).  The 
price of the highest‐stacked bid sets the “market clearing price.”  Id.  Any 
generator that bids at or below the market clearing price “clears” the auction and 
receives the market clearing price, regardless of the price the generator actually 
bid.  Id.  “A high clearing price in the capacity auction encourages new 
generators to enter the market, increasing supply and thereby lowering the 
clearing price . . . .  [A] low clearing price discourages new entry and encourages 
retirement of existing high‐cost generators.”  Hughes, 136 S. Ct. at 1293.   
 
        Nuclear generators bid into the NYISO auctions as price‐takers: since, 
unlike other types of electricity generation, they are unable to vary their output 
depending on price, they sell their entire output at the market clearing price, 
even if the price is below the cost of production. 
 
                                             B 
 
        In August 2016, the PSC issued the Clean Energy Standard (“CES”) Order 
as an overall scheme to reduce greenhouse‐gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030.  
The CES Order created two programs that bear upon this appeal: Renewable 
Energy Credits (“RECs”) and ZECs.  Plaintiffs challenge only the ZEC program, 
arguing that it is preempted by the FPA and violates the dormant Commerce 
Clause. 
 
        The REC program awards to generators one REC for each megawatt‐hour 
(MWh) of energy that is produced from renewable sources like wind and solar.  
App’x 190 (CES Order at 106).  The New York State Energy Research and 
Development Authority (“NYSERDA”) purchases RECs from generators, 
thereby providing them a subsidy.  App’x 100 (CES Order at 16).  In turn, 
NYSERDA sells the RECs to local utilities that sell energy to consumers at retail.  
Id.  The CES Order requires the utilities either to purchase RECs in an amount 
based on the percentage of the total load served by that utility or to make an 
alternative compliance payment.  App’x 98‐100 (CES Order at 14‐16).  The 
utilities may (and no doubt do) pass on the cost of RECs to consumers.  App’x 
101 (CES Order at 17). 
 



                                         7 
       The ZEC program aims to prevent nuclear generators that do not emit 
carbon dioxide from retiring until renewable sources of energy can pick up the 
slack.  A ZEC is a subsidy: a “credit for the zero‐emissions attributes of one 
megawatt‐hour of electricity production by” a participating nuclear power plant.  
App’x 254.  The PSC selects plants for the ZEC program based on five criteria: (1) 
“verifiable historic contribution . . . to the clean energy resource mix . . . in New 
York”; (2) the degree to which projected wholesale revenues are insufficient to 
prevent retirement; (3) costs and benefits of ZECs relative to clean‐energy 
alternatives; (4) impacts on ratepayers; and (5) the public interest.  App’x 208 
(CES Order at 124).  Based on these criteria, the PSC chose three nuclear plants 
for the ZEC program: FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point; it is asserted that 
other facilities, including facilities located outside New York, may be selected in 
the future.  App’x 209 (CES Order at 125). 
        
       The ZEC price is based on the so‐called “social cost of carbon”: a federal 
inter‐agency task force’s estimate of the damage from carbon emissions, which 
the PSC uses to measure the hypothetical environmental damage from nuclear 
plants’ retirement.  App’x 215 (CES Order at 131).2  The PSC then subtracts the 
portion of that cost already captured through New York’s participation in the 
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”), and multiplies the result by the 
tons of carbon avoided per MWh of zero‐emission energy.  App’x 219‐20 (CES 
Order at 135‐36).  The ZEC price generated for the program’s first two years is 
$17.48.  App’x 69 (Compl ¶ 70).  Accordingly, “each qualifying nuclear generator 
will get an additional $17.48 for each MWh of electricity it generates (subject to a 
possible cap), in addition to the price the facility receives for the sale of the 
electricity and capacity in the [NYISO] market.”  Id. 
 
       Beginning in 2019, the PSC intends to calculate a new ZEC price every two 
years.  The price may be reduced based on two considerations.  First, if the New 
York energy market experiences “additional renewable energy penetration,” 
App’x 221 (CES Order at 137), the price will fall, reflecting the reduced value of 
nuclear plants if renewable energy generation gains steam.  Second, the ZEC 
price may be adjusted downward based on forecast wholesale prices.  App’x 222

Climate Change While Strengthening the Nation’s Energy System, 44 COLUM. J. ENVTL. L. 
(forthcoming Jan. 2019). 

                                              8 
(CES Order at 138).  For each two‐year period, the PSC calculates a “reference 
price forecast” that is equal to the sum of forecast NYISO “Zone A” (i.e., Western 
New York) energy and capacity prices during the period.  Id.  The reference price 
forecast is not paid to the ZEC plants, but rather sets a benchmark for reducing 
the ZEC price: if the reference price forecast exceeds $39/MWh (a historical 
approximation of Zone A energy and capacity prices), the two‐year ZEC price is 
reduced by the difference.  Id. 
 
       As in the REC program, the NYSERDA purchases ZECs from the selected 
plants, and local utilities are required to purchase ZECs from NYSERDA in 
proportion to its share of total state electric load.  App’x 70‐71 (Compl. ¶ 73).  
Alternatively, the utilities may purchase both ZECs and energy directly from the 
generators.  App’x 235‐36 (CES Order at 151‐52).  The utilities may then pass 
along these costs to consumers. 
        
                                              C 
        
       The complaint, filed October 19, 2016, alleges that the ZEC program alters 
the prices that result from FERC’s auction system and distorts the market 
mechanism for determining which nuclear power plants should close.  The 
subsidized nuclear generators receive the value of the ZECs in addition to what 
they earn in the wholesale markets; as a result (it is alleged), New York “is using 
the ZEC subsidy to exert a large depressive effect on energy and capacity prices, 
which one group of experts estimated at $15 billion over 12 years.”  App’x 58‐59 
(Compl. ¶ 47).  Plaintiffs claim that the depressive effect will cause (1) generators 
(such as themselves) to receive a lower price than they would have otherwise 
and, as a result, (2) their bids to fail to clear auctions when they otherwise would 
have cleared.  App’x 71, 74 (Compl. ¶¶ 74, 87). 
        
       Accordingly, the complaint claims that the ZEC portion of the CES Order 
is both field and conflict preempted by FERC’s authority over wholesale 
electricity sales, and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause because the 
ZECs benefit only nuclear power plants located in New York.  App’x 42‐43 
(Compl. ¶¶ 7‐8).  The nuclear plants (and their owners), beneficiaries of the ZEC 
program, intervened as a Defendant.   
 



                                          9 
       The district court granted the motions by Intervenors and the state 
Defendants to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  As to the preemption claim, the court 
held that the FPA forecloses parties from invoking equity jurisdiction to bring a 
claim under the FPA, and that, in any event, Plaintiffs failed to state a plausible 
claim.  As to the Commerce Clause claim, the court held that Plaintiffs lack a 
cause of action because their alleged injuries did not fall within the zone of 
interests protected by the dormant Commerce Clause; as to the merits, the court 
held the Plaintiffs’ claim fails because New York was acting as a market 
participant, rather than a regulator, when it created ZECs. 
        
       This appeal followed. 
 
                                           II 
 
       We review de novo a district court’s grant of a motion to dismiss under 
Rule 12(b)(6), “construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual 
allegations as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.”  
Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 230 (2d Cir. 2016).  The complaint 
must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 
556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  
“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that 
allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for 
the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  For Rule 12(b)(6) purposes, the complaint 
“include[s] any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements 
or documents incorporated in it by reference.”  Allco Finance Ltd. v. Klee, 
861 F.3d 82, 97 n.13 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
        
                                          III 
 
       Plaintiffs invoke the court’s equity jurisdiction to prevent enforcement of 
the CES Order on the ground that it is preempted by the FPA, while Defendants 
argue that such jurisdiction is implicitly foreclosed by the same statute.  See 
Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, 135 S. Ct. 1378 (2015).  However, as the 
Seventh Circuit recognized in Electric Power Supply Association, this dispute 
does not implicate the district court’s subject‐matter jurisdiction, which rests 
securely on 18 U.S.C. § 1331 and 16 U.S.C. § 825p.  See 2018 WL 4356683, at *1.  



                                         10 
We need not consider the parties’ disagreement regarding equity jurisdiction 
because we conclude (as did the Seventh Circuit) that federal law does not 
preempt the state statute ‐‐ that is, since Plaintiffs’ claims fail either on the merits 
or for lack of standing, the question regarding equity is obviated. 
 
                                           IV 
 
       The laws of the United States are “the supreme Law of the Land . . . any 
Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  
U.S. Const. art. VI cl. 2.  Congress therefore may preempt state law through 
federal legislation.  “Our inquiry into the scope of a [federal] statuteʹs pre‐
emptive effect is guided by the rule that the purpose of Congress is the ultimate 
touchstone in every pre‐emption case.”  Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 
555 U.S. 70, 76 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).   
 
       If Congress has not expressly preempted a state statute, it may do so 
implicitly through either “field” or “conflict” preemption.  Under field 
preemption, a state law is preempted if “Congress has legislated 
comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the 
States to supplement federal law.”  Nw. Cent. Pipeline Corp. v. State Corp. 
Commʹn of Kan., 489 U.S. 493, 509 (1989).  Conflict preemption arises “where 
compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or where the state law 
stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes 
and objectives of Congress.”  Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1591, 1599 
(2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs challenge the ZEC program 
on both scores.  We consider field preemption first and conflict preemption next. 
 
                                            V 
 
       The FPA divides responsibility for regulating energy between the states 
and the federal government.  FERC has exclusive power to regulate “the sale of 
electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.”  16 U.S.C § 824(a).  FERC 
must ensure that “[a]ll rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any 
public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable.”  16 
U.S.C. § 824d(a).  While FERC’s authority extends to “rules or practices affecting 



                                          11 
wholesale rates,” this affecting jurisdiction is limited to “rules or practices that 
directly affect the [wholesale] rate” so that FERC’s jurisdiction does not “assum[e] 
near‐infinite breadth.”  FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n, 136 S. Ct. 760, 774 
(2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis and alteration in original). 
        
       However, “the law places beyond FERC’s power, and leaves to the States 
alone, the regulation of ‘any other sale’—most notably, any retail sale—of 
electricity.”  Id. at 766 (quoting 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)).  The states are thus 
authorized to regulate energy production, 16 U.S.C. § 824(b), and facilities used 
for the generation of electric energy, 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1).  See Pac. Gas & Elec. 
Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation and Dev. Commʹn, 461 U.S. 190, 205 (1983) 
(“Need for new power facilities, their economic feasibility, and rates and 
services, are areas that have been characteristically governed by the States.”). 
        
       When “coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary 
administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for 
federal pre‐emption becomes a less persuasive one.” New York State Dept. of 
Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 421 (1973).  Courts must avoid mistaking 
the “‘congressionally designed interplay between state and federal regulation’ 
for impermissible tension that requires pre‐emption under the Supremacy 
Clause.” Hughes, 136 S. Ct. at 1300 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quoting 
Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 518).  In this Circuit, there is a “strong 
presumption against finding that the [State’s] powers” are preempted by the 
FPA, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Hudson River‐Black River Regulating 
Dist., 673 F.3d 84, 94 (2d Cir. 2012), legislation that was “drawn with meticulous 
regard for the continued exercise of state power,” Rochester Gas & Elec. Corp. v. 
PSC of N.Y., 754 F.2d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 1985).  That presumption may be overcome 
only if displacing state authority was Congress’ “clear and manifest purpose.”  
Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565 (2009). 
        
                                            A 
 
       An FPA field preemption claim was recently considered by the Supreme 
Court in Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288 (2016).  A 
Maryland program required utilities to enter into a “contract‐for‐differences” 
with a favored power plant.  135 S. Ct. at 1294.  Local utilities were required to 



                                         12 
pay the shortfall if the plant cleared the capacity auction, but the clearing price 
fell below the state‐determined contract price; if the clearing price exceeded the 
contract price, the plant paid the difference to the utilities.  Id. at 1295.  The 
Maryland program thus provided subsidies to the generator that were 
conditioned on the generator’s sale of capacity into a FERC‐regulated auction.  
Id. at 1292.  By guaranteeing a rate distinct from the auction clearing price, 
“Maryland’s program invade[d] FERC’s regulatory turf,” and was therefore 
preempted.  Id. at 1297.   
        
       The Court cautioned, however, that “[n]othing in this opinion should be 
read to foreclose Maryland and other States from encouraging production of new 
or clean generation through measures untethered to a generatorʹs wholesale market 
participation.”  Id. at 1299 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).  
The Court expressly left open the viability of other measures to develop energy 
generation, such as “tax incentives, land grants, direct subsidies, construction of 
state‐owned generation facilities, or re‐regulation of the energy sector.”  Id.  “So 
long as a State does not condition payment of funds on capacity clearing the 
auction, the State’s program would not suffer from the fatal defect that renders 
Maryland’s program unacceptable.”  Id. 
        
       Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is indistinguishable from the 
Maryland program preempted in Hughes.  The program is said to be “expressly 
tethered to wholesale prices resulting from the NYISO auctions” because (1) “the 
state requires [utilities] to make up the difference between the state’s rate and the 
FERC‐approved market rates”; (2) “the subsidy varies inversely with FERC‐
approved auction rates”; and (3) “the subsidy is ‘received’ by the favored 
producers ‘in connection with’ the sale of electricity on wholesale markets.”  Br. 
of Appellants 6, 32 (quoting 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a), 824d(e)).  Plaintiffs 
mischaracterize Hughes and the ZEC program. 
 
       The Maryland contract‐for‐differences program insulated generators from 
fluctuations in wholesale prices by guaranteeing that they would receive “the 
difference between . . . the clearing price” and the state‐determined “price 
guaranteed in the contract for differences.”  Hughes, 135 S. Ct. at 1295.  New 
York’s scheme avoids (or skirts) the Hughes prohibition.  Until 2019, the ZEC 
price cannot vary from the social cost of carbon, as determined by a federal 



                                         13 
interagency workgroup.  App’x 213–14, 266.  After 2019, the ZEC price is fixed 
for two‐year periods, and does not fluctuate during those periods to match the 
wholesale clearing price.  Because the fixed ZEC price is capped based on an 
independent variable (the social cost of carbon), generators are exposed to 
market risk in the event that energy prices fall.  Moreover, the price may be fixed 
below the social cost of carbon, but only on the basis of forecast wholesale prices ‐
‐ forecasts based on futures prices that FERC does not regulate, Hunter v. FERC, 
711 F.3d 155, 157 (D.C. Cir. 2013) ‐‐ and there is no true‐up to reconcile forecasts 
with actual rates.  The ZEC price also adjusts based on the amount of renewable 
energy generation in New York.  App’x 221 (CES Order at 137).  Accordingly, 
there is no support for Plaintiffs’ contention that the “subsidy varies in almost 
exactly the same manner” as in Hughes.  Br. of Appellants 38.   
 
        Plaintiffs argue that Hughes preempts state programs if they are tethered 
to “FERC‐regulated wholesale electricity prices.”  Br. of Appellants 10; see also 
id. at 40–42, 48.  But the tether in Hughes is tied to “wholesale market 
participation,” not prices, 136 S. Ct. at 1299 (emphasis added); the Maryland 
program was unlawful because it conditioned payment on auction sales. 
 
        As the district court held, Rochester Gas forecloses Plaintiffs’ price‐
tethering theory.  It was argued in that case that the FPA preempted the PSC’s 
policy of calculating intrastate retail rates by making a “reasonable estimate” of 
wholesale sales revenues.  Id. at 100–01.  We held that tying retail prices (which 
are under state jurisdiction) to estimates of wholesale revenues (which are under 
FERC’s) is permissible because there is “a distinction between” a state 
impermissibly “regulating [wholesale] sales” and a state “reflecting the profits 
from a reasonable estimate of those sales” when acting within its jurisdiction.  Id. 
at 105. 
 
        Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish Rochester Gas on two grounds.  First, they 
argue that Rochester Gas addresses only retail rate‐making, whereas the ZEC 
program addresses wholesale rate‐making.  But that argument mischaracterizes 
the ZEC program, which avoids setting wholesale prices and instead regulates 
the environmental attributes of energy generation and in the process considers 
forecasts of wholesale pricing. 
         



                                         14 
        Second, Plaintiffs distinguish Rochester Gas on the ground that the ZEC 
program has a direct impact on the generators’ “position toward” the wholesale 
markets.  Br. of Appellants 39.  But the same was true in Rochester Gas: the PSC 
policy allowed generators to keep operating, regardless of wholesale revenue, 
because recovery of costs was guaranteed through retail rates.  What mattered in 
Rochester Gas was whether the retail rate adjustment, which factored in expected 
wholesale revenues, intruded on FERC’s jurisdictional turf by compelling 
wholesale market participation.  The analogous question here would be whether 
ZECs compel generators to make wholesale sales.  We conclude that they do not. 
         
        Plaintiffs argue that the plants’ owners are “Exempt Wholesale 
Generators” (“EWGs”), which are “legally required to sell their output into 
wholesale markets.”  Br. of Appellants 33.  Accepting the allegations of the 
complaint as true (and ignoring the fact that neither Exelon nor LIPA have EWG 
status), Plaintiffs point to nothing in the CES Order that requires the ZEC plants 
to participate in the wholesale market.  EWG status affords an exemption from 
certain regulations; but a ZEC plant may relinquish EWG status in order to sell 
directly to consumers (if it deems the tradeoff worthwhile) ‐‐ and still receive 
ZECs.  As the district court concluded, a generator’s decision to sell power into 
the wholesale markets is a business decision that does not give rise to 
preemption concerns.  Special App’x 20‐21.  Accordingly, there is no support for 
Plaintiffs’ assertion that the CES Order tethers the ZEC plants’ receipt of ZECs to 
participation in the wholesale markets ‐‐ the “fatal defect” that doomed the 
contract‐for‐differences program in Hughes.  136 S. Ct. at 1299. 
         
        Citing Allco Finance Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2015), Plaintiffs argue 
that the absence of a statutory compulsion for generators to sell into the 
wholesale market does not save a state program that would otherwise be 
preempted.  Allco considered a Connecticut statute that arranged for utilities to 
enter into bilateral wholesale electricity contracts with renewable energy 
generators.  The plaintiff argued that the statute “[c]ompe[lled] a wholesale 
transaction” between the generators and utilities and thus regulated wholesale 
sales.  Id. at 97.  We disagreed, because generators and utilities (rather than the 
state) made the ultimate decision to sign the contracts.  Id. at 98, 100.   
         
        Plaintiffs contend that Allco supports their argument because the Court 



                                          15 
emphasized that the contracts were subject to FERC evaluation as just and 
reasonable, whereas the ZEC transactions are not.  Id. at 199.  However, the 
evident reason that the contracts were subject to FERC review is that they were 
contracts for wholesale electricity sales, over which FERC has jurisdiction.  Here, 
the only transactions New York compels are ZEC sales, and ZECs are sold 
separately from wholesale sales.  Because there is no wholesale sale when ZECs 
change hands, FERC lacks jurisdiction to decide whether the ZEC transactions 
are just and reasonable.  Allco is therefore inapposite. 
        
                                            B 
 
       Plaintiffs concede that the ZEC program “does not expressly mandate that 
the plants receiving ZEC subsidies bid into the NYISO auctions,” Br. of 
Appellants 8; rather, they argue that the “practical effect” of the ZEC program is 
to regulate wholesale prices, id. at 35, and that a state law is preempted even if it 
does not formally regulate wholesale prices, if that is its practical effect.  
Plaintiffs rely on Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Commission of 
Kansas, 372 U.S. 84 (1963), in which a Kansas law requiring an interstate pipeline 
to purchase gas ratably from producers was preempted by the Natural Gas Act 
(“NGA”).3  The state rule did not expressly regulate wholesale prices, but the 
Court reasoned that “our inquiry is not at an end because the orders do not deal 
in terms with prices or volumes of purchases . . . .  The federal regulatory scheme 
leaves no room either for direct state regulation of the prices of interstate 
wholesales of natural gas, or for state regulations which would indirectly achieve 
the same result.”  Id. at 90‐91 (citations omitted). 
 
       However, Northern Natural held that the Kansas law was preempted 
because it was “unmistakably and unambiguously directed at purchasers [i.e., 
interstate pipelines] who take gas in Kansas for resale after transportation in 
interstate commerce.”  Id. at 92.  The Court emphasized that “our cases have 
consistently recognized a significant distinction,” with “constitutional 
consequences, between conservation measures aimed directly at interstate 
purchasers and wholesales for resale, and those aimed at producers and 
production.”  Id. at 94. 

3 The Supreme Court has “routinely relied on NGA cases in determining the scope of 
the FPA.”  Hughes, 136 S. Ct. at 1298 n. 10. 

                                         16 
         
        This distinction between regulating purchasers and producers yielded the 
opposite result in Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v. State Corp. Commission 
of Kansas, 489 U.S. 493 (1989).  Kansas hit on another way to encourage interstate 
pipelines to purchase additional Kansas‐Hugoton gas, but did so by regulating 
the producers: unless they produced their allowable quantity of gas within a 
certain timeframe, they would lose the right to produce it later ‐‐ and of course 
the pipelines could not purchase gas unless it was produced.  Id. at 497, 505.  
Relying on Northern Natural for the proposition that federal law preempts state 
regulations that have “either a direct or indirect effect on matters within federal 
control,” the pipelines asked the Court to invalidate the Kansas rule “because it 
exert[ed] pressure” on them to “increase purchases from Hugoton producers.”  
Id. at 497, 507.   
         
        FERC’s brief to the Court argued that while Kansas “intended to 
influence” the pipeline’s purchasing decisions, the state did “no more than fix[] 
limits on when producers may produce their gas” and therefore stayed within its 
jurisdiction.  Northwest Central FERC Br. at *20.  Furthermore, FERC regulation 
of the pipelines does not “protect [them] from the effect of state regulations that 
form the environment in which [they] conduct[] business within the state.”  Id. at 
*32.   
         
        The Supreme Court agreed: it would be “strange indeed” to hold that 
Congress intended to allow the states to regulate production, but only if doing so 
did not affect interstate rates.  Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 512‐13.  In Northern 
Natural, Kansas “crossed the dividing line . . . by imposing purchasing 
requirements on interstate pipelines,” but in Northwest Central, the state 
achieved the same end result by “regulat[ing] production,” a matter “firmly on 
the States’ side of that dividing line.”  Id.  The Court concluded that “we must 
take seriously the lines Congress drew in establishing [this] dual regulatory 
system,” and therefore held that the Kansas law was not preempted.  Id. 
         
        New York has kept the line in sight, and gone as near as can be without 
crossing it.  ZECs are created when electricity is produced in a statutorily‐
defined manner, regardless of whether or how the electricity is ultimately sold.  
They are defined as “the zero‐emissions attributes of one megawatt‐hour of 



                                         17 
electricity production by an eligible Zero Carbon Electric Generating Facility.”  
App’x 254 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, Northwest Central defeats Plaintiffs’ 
argument premised on practical effect: even though the ZEC program exerts 
downward pressure on wholesale electricity rates, that incidental effect is 
insufficient to state a claim for field preemption under the FPA. 
        
                                            C 
 
       FERC has confirmed that REC programs fall within the jurisdiction of the 
states, which is telling because RECs and ZECs share many similar 
characteristics.  WSPP, Inc., 139 FERC ¶ 61,061 (2012), concerned an agreement 
that facilitated wholesale sales among 300 Canadian and American parties.  The 
parties asked FERC to determine if it had jurisdiction over “unbundled” REC 
transactions.  Id. PP 2, 5 & 9.  FERC asserted jurisdiction over bundled REC 
transactions, in which “a wholesale energy sale and a REC sale take place as part 
of the same transaction,” but disclaimed jurisdiction over unbundled REC sales.  
Id.  “RECs are state‐created and state‐issued instruments certifying that electric 
energy was generated pursuant to certain requirements.”  Id. P 21.  When RECs 
are unbundled, the payment is “not a charge in connection with a wholesale 
sale,” does not “affect wholesale electricity rates,” and therefore “falls outside 
FERC jurisdiction.”  Id. P 24. 
        
       As the district court observed: “Like a REC, a ZEC is a certification of an 
energy attribute that is separate from a wholesale charge or rate . . . .  Like a REC, 
the purchase or sale of a ZEC is independent of the purchase or sale of wholesale 
energy.  Like a REC, payment for a ZEC is not conditioned on the generator’s 
participation in the wholesale auction; rather, RECs and ZECs are given in 
exchange for the renewable energy or zero‐emissions production of energy by 
generators.”  Special App’x 27 (emphases in original).  Plaintiffs argue that ZECs 
and RECs are nevertheless distinguishable for the purposes of preemption 
analysis, for two reasons. 
        
       First, Plaintiffs argue that, unlike RECs, the ZEC subsidy is tethered to 
wholesale prices.  For reasons explained above, Plaintiffs’ price‐tethering theory 
is foreclosed by Hughes and Rochester Gas; furthermore, it mischaracterizes the 
ZEC program: ZEC prices are capped by the social cost of carbon, and may 



                                          18 
adjust downwards in future years on the basis of forecast wholesale energy 
prices.   See supra Part V.A. 
        
       Second, Plaintiffs allege that ZECs are available only to generators that sell 
in the NYISO auctions, thereby guaranteeing that ZEC transactions are tied to the 
sale of electricity at wholesale.  True, ZEC plants may sell the electricity they 
generate into the wholesale auction, and all of them may well do so, but (as 
described above, supra at Part V.B), there is no support for Plaintiffs’ argument 
that the CES Order requires ZEC plants to sell power into the wholesale market.  
Under the program, the production of zero‐emissions energy results in the 
creation of ZECs; how those plants sell their electricity is a business decision that 
does not raise preemption concerns.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ two proposed 
distinctions fall flat. 
        
       Plaintiffs rely on a distortion of WSPP’s holding.  First, they assert that 
FERC “was careful to limit its holding to the features of the three specific REC 
products before it.”  Br. of Appellants 42.  However, WSPP clearly disclaims 
FERC jurisdiction over RECs when they are sold separately from electricity: the 
only REC feature that was dispositive was whether the REC was “unbundled” 
(sold separately from electricity) or “bundled” (sold together).  139 FERC ¶ 
61,064, P 24.  There is no dispute that ZECs are similarly unbundled from 
electricity transactions.  Second, Plaintiffs quote FERC’s observation that REC 
(and therefore presumably ZEC) transactions “could still fall under [FERC’s 
jurisdiction” if they were “in connection with” or “affect[ed]” wholesale rates.  
Br. of Appellants 43 (quoting 139 FERC ¶ 61,061 P 22).  But when FERC applied 
this jurisdictional standard two paragraphs later, it held (categorically) that 
unbundled REC transactions are not “in connection with a wholesale sale” and 
“do[] not affect wholesale electricity rates.”  139 FERC ¶ 61,061 P 24.  Finally, 
Plaintiffs emphasize that the REC program had “no connection to an organized 
market with energy and capacity auctions.”  Br. of Appellants 42.  But WSPP 
acknowledged that some REC recipients (like certain ZEC recipients) are EWGs, 
who are required to sell their output exclusively at wholesale.  139 FERC ¶ 61,061 
P 9.  And several states addressed in WSPP required renewable generators to bid 
into wholesale auctions.  See West‐Wide Must‐Offer Requirements, 157 FERC ¶ 
61, 051, PP 2–5 (2016) (western states subject to must‐offer capacity mandate from 
2001 to 2016 to address California energy crisis).  Yet WSPP nevertheless upheld 



                                         19 
their REC programs. 
 
       It is telling that Plaintiffs cannot persuasively explain why FERC’s holding 
regarding RECs does not apply equally to ZECs.  We conclude that Plaintiffs 
have failed to state a plausible claim of field preemption. 
 
                                            VI 
 
       A state law may be conflict preempted if it “stands as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,” 
Oneok, 135 S. Ct. at 1595, or “interferes with the method by which the federal 
statute was designed to reach this goal,” Int’l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 
479 U.S. 481, 494 (1987).  Given the FPA’s dual regulatory scheme, “conflict‐pre‐emption 
analysis must be applied sensitively in this area, so as to prevent the diminution 
of the role Congress reserved to the States while at the same time preserving the 
federal role.”  Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 515.  So long as a state is 
“regulat[ing] production or other subjects of state jurisdiction, and the means 
chosen [are] at least plausibly . . . related to matters of legitimate state concern,” 
there is no conflict preemption “unless clear damage to federal goals would 
result.”  Id. at 518, 522.   
        
       The FPA seeks to ensure, through FERC, that rates for wholesale sales 
remain just and reasonable, while simultaneously preserving state authority to 
regulate generation facilities and retail sales.  16 U.S.C. §§ 824d(a), 824(b).  As 
explained above, the ZEC program regulates production: its stated aspiration is 
to “preserve existing zero‐emissions nuclear generation resources as a bridge to 
the clean energy future,” and to “prevent backsliding” that otherwise “likely 
could not be avoided.”  App’x 85, 229.  Accordingly, ZEC program is not conflict 
preempted unless Plaintiffs can show that it would cause clear damage to federal 
goals. 
        
       Plaintiffs describe “the very goal of FERC’s wholesale market design” as 
“competition from more efficient generators.”  Br. of Appellants 46.  ZECs, 
Plaintiffs argue, “enable[] the unprofitable plants to keep dumping substantial 
amounts of electricity in the FERC markets for over a decade, even though the 
FERC‐approved price signals should cause the plants to retire.”  Id.  



                                          20 
Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program “distort[s] price signals to all 
other wholesale generators by encouraging the favored generators to bid as price 
takers and thereby artificially depress market prices.”  Id.   
        
       However, FERC itself has sanctioned state programs that increase capacity 
or affect wholesale market prices, so long as the states regulate matters within 
their jurisdiction.  Thus, states may “grant loans, subsidies or tax credits to 
particular facilities on environmental or policy grounds,” Cal. PUC, 133 FERC ¶ 
61,059, P 31 n.62, including when that makes clean generation “more competitive 
in a cost comparison with fossil‐fueled generation” or “allow[s] states to affect” 
the price, S. Cal. Edison Co., 71 FERC ¶ 61,269, 62,080 (1995).  States may 
“require retirement of existing generators” or construction of “environmentally‐
friendly units, or . . . take any other action in their role as regulators of 
generation,” even though it may “affect[] the market clearing price.”  Conn. 
Dep’t of Pub. Util. Control v. FERC, 569 F.3d 477, 481 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see also 
New England States Comm. on Elec. v. ISO New England Inc., 142 FERC ¶ 
61,108, at 61,490 (2013) (LaFleur, Comm’r, concurring) (“[S]tates have the 
unquestioned right to make policy choices through the subsidization of 
capacity.”); N.Y. State PSC, 158 FERC ¶ 61,137, 2017 WL 496267, at *11 (2017) 
(Bay, Comm’r, concurring) (observing that “all energy resources” receive 
subsidies, and that “an idealized vision of markets free from the influence of 
public policies . . . does not exist”).  Similarly, FERC told the Supreme Court in 
Hughes that states are “free” to adopt such programs, “even if the price signals 
in the regional wholesale capacity market indicate that no [such] resources are 
needed.”  Hughes U.S. Amicus Brief at 33.   
        
       As explained above, Allco considered a state initiative to raise revenue for 
clean energy generators via long‐term bilateral contracts, thereby “increas[ing] 
the supply of electricity” and “plac[ing] downward pressure on” wholesale 
prices.  861 F.3d at 89.  But the Court concluded that “[t]his incidental effect on 
wholesale prices does not . . . amount to a regulation of the interstate wholesale 
electricity market that infringes on FERC’s jurisdiction.”  Id. at 1014; see also 

4 Allco did not explicitly state whether its holding fell under a field or conflict 
preemption analysis.  However, as the district court notes, Special App’x 33 n.22, there 
is no basis to conclude that an “incidental effect” on wholesale prices withstands field 
preemption, but not conflict preemption. 

                                           21 
Northwest Central, 489 U.S. at 516 (“[R]egulating producers in such a way as to 
have some impact on the purchasing decisions and hence costs of interstate 
pipelines does not without more result in conflict pre‐emption.”). 
        
       Faced with this precedent, Plaintiffs concede New York’s authority to 
enact “measures that may have an indirect effect on . . . price signals,” but insist 
that “New York cannot directly distort the price signals that the auctions send by 
setting a higher, state‐approved rate for wholesale electricity sales.”  Br. of 
Appellants 49.  To the extent the ZEC program distorts an efficient wholesale 
market, it does so by increasing revenues for qualifying nuclear plants, which in 
turn increases the supply of electricity, which in turn lowers auction clearing 
prices.  But that is (at best) an incidental effect resulting from New York’s 
regulation of producers.  In any event, ZECs do not guarantee a certain 
wholesale price that displaces the NYISO auction price.   
        
       FERC uses auctions to set wholesale prices and to promote efficiency with 
the background assumption that the FPA establishes a dual regulatory system 
between the states and federal government and that the states engage in public 
policies that affect the wholesale markets.  Accordingly, the ZEC program does 
not cause clear damage to federal goals, and Plaintiffs have failed to state a 
plausible claim for conflict preemption. 
        
                                           VII 
 
       The Commerce Clause authorizes Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce . . . 
among the several States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  “[T]he Clause was 
designed in part to prevent trade barriers that had undermined efforts of the 
fledgling States to form a cohesive whole following their victory in the 
Revolution.”  Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 807 (1976).  
Accordingly, the Supreme Court has inferred a “negative or dormant 
implication” to the Commerce Clause, which “prohibits state taxation or 
regulation that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and 
thereby impedes free private trade in the national marketplace.”  Gen. Motors 
Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).   
        
       However, the states retain “a residuum of power . . . to make laws 



                                         22 
governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect 
interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.”  Kassel v. Consol. 
Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U.S. 662, 669 (1981) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  Accordingly, a state law or regulation offends the dormant Commerce 
Clause only if it “(1) clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of 
intrastate commerce, (2) imposes a burden on interstate commerce 
incommensurate with the local benefits secured, or (3) has the practical effect of 
extraterritorial control of commerce occurring entirely outside the boundaries of 
the state in question.”  Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth. 584 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir. 
2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
        
       Plaintiffs contend that the ZEC program violates the dormant Commerce 
Clause under the first two grounds: the program discriminates against interstate 
commerce by “deliberately propping up the in‐state Exelon plants via a 
distortion of the interstate energy market,” Br. of Appellants 52, and inflicts an 
undue burden on interstate commerce that outweighs any local interests by 
“impos[ing] market‐distorting burdens that will drive out, and deter entry of, 
more cost‐efficient, environmentally friendly out‐of‐state generators,” id. at 53.  
We do not reach the merits of these claims because we conclude that Plaintiffs 
lack Article III standing. 
        
       The jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited to “Cases” and 
“Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  There is no case or controversy unless a 
plaintiff has standing to challenge the defendant’s conduct.  Lujan v. Defenders 
of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  Although the district court did not address 
whether Plaintiffs have standing on their dormant Commerce Clause claim, 
“[t]he doctrine of standing . . . requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that 
the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy 
as to warrant his invocation of federal‐court jurisdiction.”  Summers v. Earth 
Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
        
       Article III standing requires a plaintiff to have suffered an “injury in fact” 
that is “fairly traceable” to the defendant’s challenged conduct and that is “likely 
to be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 
138 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  At the pleading stage, “the plaintiff must clearly allege facts 
demonstrating each element.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and ellipsis 



                                          23 
omitted).  Accordingly, to show standing for their dormant Commerce Clause 
claim, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that their alleged injuries are traceable to (i.e., 
“the result of,” City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983), or “a 
consequence of,” Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation 
of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 485 (1982)) discrimination against interstate 
commerce. 
        
       Plaintiffs allege that they are injured because the ZEC program allows 
“favored New York power plants to prevail in interstate competition against 
Plaintiffs” by underbidding them in the wholesale electricity markets.  Br. of 
Appellants 49.  Plaintiffs do not represent that they own any nuclear plants, in‐
state or out.  Special App’x 40.  If the PSC awarded ZECs in a non‐discriminatory 
manner to out‐of‐state nuclear plants (as it may do in the future under the terms 
of the CES Order), there would be no abatement in the injury Plaintiffs claim to 
suffer from the general market‐distorting effects of the ZEC program.  In short, 
Plaintiffs’ injuries “would continue to exist even if the [legislation] were cured” 
of the alleged discrimination.  Johnson v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 
783 F.3d 655, 662 (7th Cir. 2015).  Because Plaintiffs’ asserted injuries are not traceable to the 
alleged discrimination against out‐of‐state entities, but (rather) arises from their 
production of energy using fuels that New York disfavors, they lack Article III 
standing to challenge the ZEC program. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
       The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

""5. The program does not guarantee wholesale prices or displace federally regulated auction rates, and any effects on wholesale prices are incidental."",
""6. The ZEC program regulates production, which falls within state jurisdiction, and similar state-created energy credits have been recognized as outside federal jurisdiction when unbundled from wholesale sales."",
""7. Because the program regulates production and does not directly control wholesale market participation, plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim for field preemption."",

           EXPEDITED HEARING ORDER DENYING REQUESTED RELIEF
        Dionnie Walker alleged that her work for the Clarksville Department of Electricity
resulted in injuries to both shoulders. She seeks medical benefits for her left shoulder and
temporary disability benefits. The Department of Electricity counters that the statute of
limitations bars her left-shoulder claim, and no doctor has related that particular injury to
work.
        After a December 9, 2021 expedited hearing, the Court holds that the statute of
limitations has not run on her claim, but at this time, the medical proof does not support
that Ms. Walker’s left-shoulder condition is work-related. Therefore, the Court must deny
her requested relief.
                                            Claim History
       Ms. Walker injured her right shoulder while working for the Department of
Electricity on October 10, 2018. The Department of Electricity accepted the claim and
authorized treatment with Dr. Keith Starkweather. He performed surgery in late January
2019.1
1
 The medical proof contains a letter from the adjuster to Dr. Starkweather regarding whether Ms. Walker’s
post-surgery blood clots relate to work; he checked “no.” Ms. Walker’s mother testified, without
contradiction, that the nurse case manager presented this letter to the doctor at a visit. On this testimony
alone, it is unclear whether the nurse case manager’s conduct violated the Bureau’s rules, so the Court will
not refer the case to the Compliance Program for the potential imposition of penalties. However, the Court
cautions that a case manager “is prohibited from engaging in any activity that places him or her in an
                                                     1
        Before the surgery, Dr. Starkweather placed Ms. Walker on modified duty. She
testified that the Department of Electricity refused to accommodate her restriction, and she
had to continue her regular duties using her left arm exclusively. The Department of
Electricity offered no proof that it accommodated her restrictions.
        According to Ms. Walker, this led to overuse of the left arm. Ms. Walker’s mother
and son confirmed that, after the surgery, she had difficulty performing her daily living
activities because both arms appeared to be causing her significant pain.
       The medical records confirm that Ms. Walker discussed her left-shoulder pain with
Dr. Starkweather’s physician assistant. The February 4, 2019 notes state she was there “for
pain in her left shoulder. Her shoulder pain began a few weeks ago that has been worsening
over the past week. She is unable to lift things with the left arm.” The physician assistant
assessed “pain in left shoulder” and “tendinitis of left rotator cuff.” She injected the
shoulder. Notes from a return visit on February 18 state that Ms. Walker was there: “for
pain in her left shoulder rotator cuff tendinitis. She complains of pain since October.”
        The physician assistant ordered an MRI for the left shoulder, which never took
place. Ms. Walker testified that both her personal insurance and the workers’
compensation carrier declined to cover it, and she was unable to afford it on her own. The
workers’ compensation claims adjuster, Ruth Cromer, testified that she did not authorize
the left-shoulder MRI because she did not see a statement in the records relating it to work.2
Dr. Starkweather provided no more treatment for the left shoulder.
       Dr. Starkweather placed Ms. Walker at maximum medical improvement on July 9,
placed permanent restrictions, and assigned an impairment rating for the right shoulder.
The carrier stopped paying temporary disability benefits in June, according to Ms. Walker.
She testified without contradiction that the Department of Electricity did not offer her any
position afterward. She applied for and received unemployment insurance benefits in
March 2020. Ms. Walker said that she does not know when her termination actually
occurred—July 2019 or March 2020. The Department of Electricity offered no evidence
on this question.
       No other notes from the authorized doctor were admitted into evidence; however,
additional treatment records documented Ms. Walker’s bilateral shoulder problems. These
adversarial role to either the employee or the employer.” Philalom v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,
2021 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 34, at *17 (Oct. 8, 2021).
2
  The Department of Electricity did not disclose an intention to call Ms. Cromer as a witnesses, but Ms.
Walker did not object, so the Court permitted her testimony. The Court notes that Tennessee Compilation
Rules and Regulations 0800-02-21-.15(1)(a) states in relevant part that “[t]he party opposing the request
for expedited hearing must . . . provide a plain, concise statement detailing why the relief requested should
not be granted and listing any witnesses it intends to call at the expedited hearing.”
                                                     2
include an October 2019 MRI report of the right shoulder ordered by Dr. Starkweather. It
shows, in part, a “complete tear of the intra-articular biceps tendon with distal retraction
and blunting of the superior labral biceps anchor, chronic.” Likewise, an unauthorized
April 2021 right-shoulder MRI showed a “chronic tear long head of the biceps tendon” and
a “type II SLAP tear.” Ms. Walker underwent an MRI ̶ also unauthorized ̶ of her left
shoulder in June, which showed a type II SLAP tear and a “partial tear of the long head of
the biceps tendon.” Afterward, a doctor diagnosed right and left shoulder tears and outlined
several potential treatments, including the possibility of surgery for the left shoulder.
      Ms. Walker has since moved to New York state. She filed her petition for benefit
determination on May 13, 2021, listing the injured body part as her “right shoulder.”
       The Department of Electricity paid the last medical bill on June 5, 2020.
                        Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
       At an expedited hearing, Ms. Walker must provide sufficient evidence from which
the Court can determine she is likely to prevail at a hearing on the merits. McCord v.
Advantage Human Resourcing, 2015 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 6, at *7-8, 9 (Mar.
27, 2015).
        The threshold issue in this case is the Department of Electricity’s statute of
limitations defense. Under the Workers’ Compensation Law, in cases where the employer
has voluntarily paid benefits to or on behalf of the employee, the employee’s right to
recover compensation is forever barred unless she files a petition for benefit determination
within one year after the time the employer ceased to make payments of compensation to
or on behalf of the employee. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-203(b)(2) (2021).
        Here, the unrefuted evidence shows that Ms. Walker filed her claim within the above
limitations period. The last payment was on June 4, 2020; the petition was filed within a
year on May 13, 2021.
        The Department of Electricity argued that the statute ran on the left-shoulder claim.
It pointed out that her petition for benefit determination lists an injury to her right shoulder
only.
       The Court rejects this argument. The Department of Electricity cited no authority
for the proposition that, in cases where an employee claims injury to multiple body parts,
all must be pleaded contemporaneously for purposes of the statute of limitations. In fact,
persuasive case law suggests the opposite. See Norfleet v. J. W. Goad Constr., No. M2001-
00425-WC-R3-CV, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 811, at *6 (Tenn. Workers’ Comp. Panel Dec. 3,
2001) (Where employer argued the claims for additional conditions were not timely
because they were not included in the original complaint, but were added by amendment,
                                               3
which the employer asserted was not filed until after the statute of limitations had run, the
original complaint in the case was “sufficient” because the employer cited no rule requiring
a workers’ compensation claimant to specify his injuries in the complaint).
       Having denied this defense, the Court turns to whether Ms. Walker satisfied her
burden to show that she is entitled to additional treatment for her left shoulder.
Specifically, she must show that her left-shoulder condition is an injury “arising primarily
out of and in the course and scope of employment” that causes the need for medical
treatment. It must be shown to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the
employment contributed more than fifty percent in causing the injury, considering all
causes. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 50-6-102(14)(A)-(C). In addition:
        [A] subsequent injury, whether in the form of an aggravation of the original
        injury or a new and distinct injury, is compensable if it is the “direct and
        natural result” of a compensable injury. . . . [W]hen the primary injury is
        shown to have arisen out of and in the course of employment, every natural
        consequence that flows from the injury likewise arises out of the
        employment. Consequently, all the medical consequences and sequelae that
        flow from the primary injury are compensable.
UPS v. Brown, No. M2014-01332-SC-R3-WC, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 628, at *7-8 (Citations
omitted) (Aug. 11, 2015).
       Here, the Department of Electricity did not contest that the right-shoulder injury
arose primarily from employment.3 Rather, it argued that the medical records contain no
statements connecting the left-shoulder condition to work. The Court agrees.
       On February 4, Dr. Starkweather’s physician assistant treated Ms. Walker’s left-
shoulder pain, which “began a few weeks ago” and was worsening, with an injection. On
February 18, the notes state that Ms. Walker was there “for pain in her left shoulder rotator
cuff tendinitis. She complains of pain since October.” These notations support Ms.
Walker’s testimony regarding the timing of the onset of her left-shoulder pain.
       However, these statements do not say that the left-shoulder condition arose
primarily out of and in the course and scope of employment, causing the need for medical
treatment, and that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the employment
contributed more than fifty percent in causing the injury, considering all causes. The
physician assistant also gave no opinion as to whether the left-shoulder pain was the “direct
and natural result” of the right-shoulder injury. Likewise, the June 2021 MRI results show
3
  The Department of Electricity’s counsel stated that it made a settlement offer for the right shoulder that
remains in place, if Ms. Walker chooses to accept it. Further, the dispute certification notice lists only the
left shoulder as “disputed.” Therefore, it appears that the Department of Electricity remains willing to
provide treatment for Ms. Walker’s right shoulder.
                                                      4
tearing in the left shoulder, and a medical doctor discussed the tears with her, but the notes
do not show that he linked her left shoulder condition to her work. Simply put, the records
are silent on the cause of her left-shoulder pain.
       The Court finds Ms. Walker’s testimony wholly credible. She testified, and the
Court finds, that the Department of Electricity did not accommodate her restrictions in the
months following her right shoulder injury. She posited that complete reliance on her left
arm resulted in “overuse” and injury. The Court finds this entirely plausible.
       However, the Appeals Board has held, “It is well-settled that the employee in a
workers’ compensation claim has the burden of proof on all essential elements of the
claim.” Lurz v. Int’l Paper Co., 2018 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 8, at *14 (Feb. 14,
2018). Ms. Walker needs medical proof to support her argument. The record before this
Court at this time does not contain this evidence. Per the Appeals Board, “[J]udges are not
well-suited to make independent medical determinations without expert medical testimony
supporting such a determination. Likewise, parties . . . cannot rely solely on their own
medical interpretations of the evidence to successfully support their arguments.” Id. at *18(Citation omitted).
        Therefore, the Court holds that Ms. Walker has not satisfied her burden to show that
she is likely to prove her left-shoulder condition arose primarily out of her employment.
Nothing in this order precludes Ms. Walker from seeking that evidence and requesting
another expedited hearing.
        Finally, Ms. Walker seeks temporary disability benefits. An injured worker is
eligible for temporary disability benefits if: (1) the worker became disabled from working
due to a compensable injury; (2) there is a causal connection between the injury and the
inability to work; and (3) the worker established the duration of the period of disability.
Jones v. Crencor Leasing and Sales, 2015 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 48, at *7 (Dec.
11, 2015).
       Here, since the Court was unable to hold that Ms. Walker’s left-shoulder condition
arose primarily from work, it cannot find that she is likely to prove she became disabled
from working due to a compensable injury. The Court cannot hold that she is entitled to
these benefits at this time.
IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AS FOLLOWS:
   1. Ms. Walker’s requested relief is denied at this time.
   2. This case is set for a status hearing on February 7, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. Central
   Time. Please call (615) 532-9552 or (866) 943-0025. Failure to appear may result in
   a determination of the issues without your participation.

                           Expedited Hearing Order Right to Appeal:
     If you disagree with this Expedited Hearing Order, you may appeal to the Workers’
Compensation Appeals Board. To appeal an expedited hearing order, you must:
   1. Complete the enclosed form entitled: “Notice of Appeal,” and file the form with the
      Clerk of the Court of Workers’ Compensation Claims within seven business days of the
      date the expedited hearing order was filed. When filing the Notice of Appeal, you must
      serve a copy upon all parties.
   2. You must pay, via check, money order, or credit card, a $75.00 filing fee within ten
      calendar days after filing of the Notice of Appeal. Payments can be made in-person at
      any Bureau office or by U.S. mail, hand-delivery, or other delivery service. In the
      alternative, you may file an Affidavit of Indigency (form available on the Bureau’s
      website or any Bureau office) seeking a waiver of the fee. You must file the fully-
      completed Affidavit of Indigency within ten calendar days of filing the Notice of
      Appeal. Failure to timely pay the filing fee or file the Affidavit of Indigency will
      result in dismissal of the appeal.
   3. You bear the responsibility of ensuring a complete record on appeal. You may request
      from the court clerk the audio recording of the hearing for a $25.00 fee. If a transcript of
      the proceedings is to be filed, a licensed court reporter must prepare the transcript and file
      it with the court clerk within ten business days of the filing the Notice of
      Appeal. Alternatively, you may file a statement of the evidence prepared jointly by both
      parties within ten business days of the filing of the Notice of Appeal. The statement of
      the evidence must convey a complete and accurate account of the hearing. The Workers’
      Compensation Judge must approve the statement before the record is submitted to the
      Appeals Board. If the Appeals Board is called upon to review testimony or other proof
      concerning factual matters, the absence of a transcript or statement of the evidence can be
      a significant obstacle to meaningful appellate review.
   4. If you wish to file a position statement, you must file it with the court clerk within ten
      business days after the deadline to file a transcript or statement of the evidence. The
      party opposing the appeal may file a response with the court clerk within ten business
      days after you file your position statement. All position statements should include: (1) a
      statement summarizing the facts of the case from the evidence admitted during the
      expedited hearing; (2) a statement summarizing the disposition of the case as a result of
      the expedited hearing; (3) a statement of the issue(s) presented for review; and (4) an
      argument, citing appropriate statutes, case law, or other authority.

ZURICH AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY, Plaintiff, Appellant,
v.
ELECTRICITY MAINE, LLC ; Emile Clavet; Kevin Dean; Spark HoldCo, LLC ; Provider Power, LLC ; Katherine Veileux and Jennifer Chon, individually and behalf of all other similarly situated parties, Defendants, Appellees.No. 18-1968United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.June 17, 2019John S. Whitman, Esq., with whom Richardson, Whitman, Large, & Badger, Portland, ME, were on brief for appellant.Timothy E. Steigelman, with whom Melissa A. Hewey, and Drummond Woodsum, Portland, ME, were on brief for appellees.Before Howard, Chief Judge, Boudin and Barron, Circuit Judges.
Combined Opinion by Barron

BARRON, Circuit Judge.
Electricity Maine LLC is a private energy company that serves customers in Maine. It held a D&O insurance policy (the ""Policy"") with Zurich American Insurance Co. (""Zurich"") when, in November of 2015, a class action was brought against it, Spark HoldCo LLC, Emile Clavet, and Kevin Dean (together ""Electricity Maine""). The named plaintiffs were two of Electricity Maine's customers, Jennifer Chon and Katherine Veilleux. They sought to represent a class of nearly 200,000 of the company's customers. The complaint alleged that Electricity Maine had engaged in misconduct that resulted in customers receiving higher bills than Electricity Maine had represented that they would be. The complaint sought class-wide damages totaling approximately $ 35 million for a variety of Maine state common law claims, as well as for claims under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962 , 1964 ; and the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5 § 207.
*35 Electricity Maine tendered notice of the suit to Zurich. Zurich then initiated the present action against Electricity Maine in the United States District Court for the District of Maine on May 3, 2017, based on diversity jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1332 . Zurich seeks a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend Electricity Maine against the underlying action. Zurich contends that Electricity Maine's policy 1 with Zurich provides, in relevant part, that Zurich has a duty to defend Electricity Maine against any lawsuit that seeks damages for ""bodily injury"" caused by an ""occurrence"" and that the complaint in the underlying action fails to allege that Electricity Maine engaged in conduct that qualifies as an ""occurrence"" or that caused any ""bodily injury.""
Zurich and Electricity Maine cross-moved for summary judgment on a stipulated record. The District Court ruled for Electricity Maine. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Electricity Maine LLC , 325 F. Supp. 3d 198 , 202-03 (D. Me. 2018). This appeal followed. We affirm.
I.
We review the District Court's decisions on the parties' motions for summary judgment de novo. See Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Herbert H. Landy Ins. Agency, Inc. , 820 F.3d 36 , 41 (1st Cir. 2016). We must affirm the judgments below if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and the District Court's conclusions are correct as a matter of law. See id.
The parties agree that the only issues presented on appeal concern the District Court's interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Policy. Those issues present matters of law, which we review de novo. Massamont Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co. , 489 F.3d 71 , 72 (1st Cir. 2007).
The parties agree that Maine law controls the interpretive questions at issue on appeal. Under Maine law, ""[i]f the allegations in the underlying ... action are within the risk insured against and there is any potential basis for recovery, the insurer must defend the insured regardless of the actual facts on which the insured's ultimate liability may be based."" Elliott v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 711 A.2d 1310 , 1312 (Me. 1998).
To determine if the allegations in the underlying action are within the risk insured, we must ""compar[e] the complaint with the terms of the insurance contract."" Id. The key terms in the Policy that define the ""risk insured"" are ""occurrence"" and ""bodily injury.""
II.
The Policy defines an ""occurrence"" to be ""an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions."" The Policy does not define what constitutes an ""accident,"" but the Maine Law Court (the ""Law Court"") has explained that an ""accident"" is ""commonly understood to mean ... an event that takes place without one's forethought or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event."" Kelley v. N.E. Ins. Co. , 168 A.3d 779 , 782 (Me. 2017) (quoting Patrick v. J.B. Ham Co. , 119 Me. 510 , 111 A. 912 , 915 (1921) ).
The complaint in the underlying action sets forth a number of claims for intentional torts, but also includes a claim *36 for ""negligence"" and a claim for ""negligent misrepresentation."" The negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims would appear to seek recovery for the kind of conduct that fits comfortably within the definition of an ""accident,"" as these claims require proof only of ""event[s] that take[ ] place without one's forethought or expectation."" Kelley , 168 A.3d at 782 . Indeed, the Law Court has held multiple times that ""broad conclusory allegations of 'negligence,' "" pled in the alternative to claims that require proof of intentional misconduct, constitute allegations of ""accidental"" or ""[un]intentional"" activity that suffice to trigger the duty to defend under policies that cover ""accidents."" Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell , 414 A.2d 220 , 225-27 (Me. 1980) (finding a duty to defend for an ""accident[ ]"" where the complaint alleged negligent acts in the alternative to intentional conduct); Lavoie v. Dorchester Mut. Fire Ins. Co. , 560 A.2d 570 , 571 (Me. 1989) (finding a duty to defend under a policy with an exclusion for ""intentional"" acts where a complaint alleged negligence as an alternative to its intentional assault and battery claims).
To blunt the force of this precedent, Zurich relies on two Law Court cases- Allocca v. York Ins. Co. of Maine , 169 A.3d 938 (Me. 2017) and Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ben-Ami , 193 A.3d 178 (Me. 2018) -that were decided after Travelers and Lavoie . But, neither Allocca nor Ben-Ami involved complaints that, like the complaint at issue here, expressly allege claims for negligence (or negligent misrepresentation) alongside claims for intentional torts. Allocca , 169 A.3d at 940-41 ; Ben-Ami , 193 A.3d at 180-81 .
Zurich also attempts to distinguish Travelers and Lavoie from the present case on the ground that, unlike in those cases, the facts alleged in the complaint here ""make it impossible to sustain the fiction that Electricity Maine was 'negligent' and expected no harm to befall its customers."" Zurich is right that the portion of the complaint that sets forth the RICO claims, alleges that Electricity Maine promised its customers rates that were lower than those offered by the public utilities, raised those rates unexpectedly after the first year of the customers' contracts, notified its customers about the rate increases through emails that were sent to the customers' spam folders, and required that customers pay a $ 100 fee if they wanted to leave these more expensive contracts. And, Zurich is also right that this portion of the complaint does allege that the company engaged in that conduct intentionally, just as one would expect, given that RICO claims seek recovery for intentional torts.
But we do not see why, when the complaint goes on to incorporate by reference the same factual allegations into its claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation, it must be read to be alleging, with respect to those claims, that Electricity Maine acted intentionally rather than inadvertently. Those claims, unlike the RICO claims, do not require proof of intentional conduct. We note, moreover, that this conclusion accords with Harlor v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co , 150 A.3d 793 (Me. 2016). There, the Law Court explained that the duty to defend is triggered so long as a complaint ""reveals ... any legal or factual basis that could potentially be developed at trial"" for proving conduct that would fall within the risk insured. Id. at 797 (emphasis added). And, as we explained in Auto Europe, LLC v. Conn. Indem. Co. , after canvassing Maine law, the duty to defend is triggered under the state's law ""where a narrow reading of the complaint's factual allegations might preclude coverage, but the alleged cause of action is sufficiently broad that a modified version of the facts could *37 be developed at trial to show liability."" 321 F.3d 60 , 68 (1st Cir. 2003).
That is not to say that either the negligent misrepresentation claim or the negligence claim has merit. But, even a ""broad, conclusory allegation, such as negligence"" that is ""legally insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss"" will trigger an insurer's duty to defend ""whenever the allegations show a potential that liability will be established within the insurance coverage."" Travelers , 414 A.2d at 226 .
Zurich does point to precedents in which various courts, including our own, have, in construing Maine law, concluded that a particular complaint in an underlying suit failed to set forth factual allegations of a type that could trigger an insurer's duty to defend its insured against claims that had been set forth in that complaint. See Lyman Morse Boatbuilding, Inc. v. N. Assurance Co. of Am. , 772 F.3d 960 , 966 (1st Cir. 2014) ; Prime Tanning Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. , 750 F. Supp. 2d 198 , 214-15 (D. Me. 2010) ; Baywood Corp. v. Me. Bonding & Casualty Co. , 628 A.2d 1029 , 1031 (Me. 1993) ; A. Johnson & Co., Inc. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. , 933 F.2d 66 , 75 (1st Cir. 1991). But, none of the complaints in those cases pled claims for both intentional and unintentional torts and incorporated by reference facts that pertained to the former to support the latter in the way that the complaint at issue here does. Thus, none of those precedents undermines our conclusion that this complaint is fairly read to set forth-at least in a ""broad, conclusory"" fashion, Travelers , 414 A.2d at 226 -factual allegations of negligent conduct by Electricity Maine. Accordingly, none of those precedents supplies a basis for concluding that this complaint fails to allege facts that fall within the risk insured by the Policy, at least insofar as that risk is defined by the Policy's definition of an ""occurrence."" Id .
III.
Zurich separately contends that the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" does not encompass the allegations of misconduct by Electricity Maine contained in the complaint at issue. Thus, the company contends, for this reason as well, that the complaint fails to contain factual allegations that fall within the risk insured.
Electricity Maine acknowledges that the complaint does not allege that its conduct caused ""bodily injury."" The company contends, however, that Harlor makes clear that the complaint need not do so to trigger Zurich's duty to defend. We agree.
In Harlor , as in this case, the underlying complaint did not allege ""bodily injury."" Harlor , 150 A.3d at 800 . Nevertheless, the Law Court held that the insurer in that case had a duty to defend under the policy at issue, because the tortious conduct alleged in the complaint in the underlying action ""could have resulted in ... bodily harm due to emotional distress."" Id. ; see also York Ins. Grp. of Me. v. Lambert , 740 A.2d 984 , 985-86 (Me. 1999) (holding the same). Moreover, Harlor reached that conclusion even though the complaint in that underlying action did not expressly allege ""emotional distress."" Harlor , 150 A.3d at 800 .
Zurich contends that the Policy expressly defines ""bodily injury"" to encompass ""mental injury, shock, [or] fright ... resulting from bodily injury ...."" (Emphasis added). Zurich then goes on to argue that, in consequence, the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" is best read, impliedly, to exclude from its scope ""bodily injury"" that is caused by emotional distress. And, Zurich contends, this definition of ""bodily injury"" differs from the definition of ""bodily injury"" used in the policy that was at issue *38 in either Harlor or York , such that neither precedent supports Electricity Maine's position here.
But, while the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" states that it "" includes "" ""mental injury, shock, [or] fright resulting from bodily injury,"" (emphasis added), the definition does not state that it excludes coverage for ""bodily injury"" caused by those markers of emotional distress. Thus, because Maine law requires us to construe ambiguous policy language in favor of the insured, we reject Zurich's restrictive construction of the Policy. See Foremost Ins. Co. v. Levesque , 868 A.2d 244 , 246 (Me. 2005) (""Any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be resolved against the insurer and in favor of coverage."").
Zurich has one last argument for why, Harlor notwithstanding, the inclusion of the negligent misrepresentation and negligence claims provides no basis for concluding that the complaint sets forth factual allegations that fall within the ""risk insured,"" at least insofar as the Policy's definition of ""bodily injury"" establishes the risk that Zurich has agreed to insure. Zurich points out that a claim for ""negligent misrepresentation"" cannot give rise to damages for emotional distress under Maine law, see Veilleux v. National Broadcasting Co. , 206 F.3d 92 , 130 (1st Cir. 2000), and thus that the negligent misrepresentation claim here cannot be treated as one that seeks damages-even potentially-for bodily injury that arises from such emotional distress. Zurich further contends that the putatively stand-alone negligence claim is in fact just a mirror of the claim that Electricity Maine committed the tort of negligent misrepresentation. Accordingly, Zurich argues that, even though damages for emotional distress often may be recovered for a negligence claim, see Curran v. Richardson , 448 F. Supp. 2d 228 , 231 (D. Me. 2006) (citing Curtis v. Porter , 784 A.2d 18 , 27 (Me. 2001) ), the negligence claim that is set forth in the complaint at issue here cannot.
But, Zurich's argument overlooks the fact that the Law Court has, in construing Maine law, held that claims involving negligent omissions for which there was no statutory duty to disclose were not negligent misrepresentation claims, but were, instead, more appropriately characterized as pure negligence claims. See Binette v. Dyer Library Ass'n , 688 A.2d 898 , 905-06 (Me. 1996). Here, the face of the complaint is fairly read to permit the conclusion that the negligence claim includes allegations of negligent omissions of just that sort. The complaint alleges that Electricity Maine failed to notify its customers that their contracts would ""automatically renew"" at higher rates and, similarly, failed to notify its customers that they would face a $ 100 termination fee if they attempted to leave their contracts. Thus, in accord with Auto Europe , we conclude that, even though ""a narrow reading of the complaint's factual allegations might preclude coverage ... the alleged cause of action is sufficiently broad that a modified version of the facts could be developed at trial to show liability."" 321 F.3d at 68 .
Zurich does make the sweeping contention in its reply brief that emotional distress damages under Maine law may be recovered in negligence claims only for conduct that resulted in physical injuries, presumably to support the contention that damages may not be recovered in such claims for physical injuries that result from emotional distress. But, aside from the fact that arguments that are made for the first time in reply briefs are waived, see United States v. Torres , 162 F.3d 6 , 11 (1st Cir. 1998), Zurich does not cite to any precedent that supports its broad assertion about the limited circumstances in which damages for emotional distress may be *39 recovered for the tort of negligence in Maine. Nor does Zurich address the fact that the Law Court stated in Curtis that ""most tort actions"" can give rise to recovery for emotional distress. Curtis , 784 A.2d at 26 . Thus, we treat as waived for lack of development any argument that a negligence claim for an omission such as was alleged to have occurred here cannot give rise to emotional distress damages under Maine law. See United States v. Zannino , 895 F.2d 1 , 17 (1st Cir. 1990).
None of this is to deny that one might doubt whether, in the context of this case, the alleged negligence is of a type that could cause distress that would result in bodily injury. But, the Law Court has made clear that, for purposes of Maine insurance law, where ""general allegations for the particular claims asserted in the underlying complaint ... could potentially support an award of covered damages for bodily injury caused by emotional distress,"" the duty to defend exists. Harlor , 150 A.3d at 799 (emphasis added).
IV.
For the foregoing reasons we affirm the District Court's decisions granting summary judgment in favor of Electricity Maine and denying the appellants' Motion for Summary Judgment. The parties shall bear their own costs.
 1
The terms of the Policy were set forth in three successive contracts. The parties agree that the relevant language is identical from one contract to the next, and, therefore, should be treated as one policy.

MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER
VALERIE:CAPRQNI, United States District Judge:
Some say that human-caused global warming is a “hoax,”1 while others accept the overwhelming scientific conclusion that human activities, and particularly carbon dioxide discharges into the atmosphere, are causing the planet to warm. Although no individual State can reverse the trend all by itself, New York and many other States have decided that they will do their part to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming. The issue in this case is whether the method New York has chosen to facilitate its doing so is constitutional. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the New York program is constitutional,
Plaintiffs are various electrical generators and trade groups of electrical generators. They challenge one aspect of the Clean Energy Standard (“CES”) Order, adopted by the New York Public Service Commission (“PSC”), that awards credits to certain nuclear generators for their zero-emissions electricity production. Plaintiffs .claim that this program is preempted under the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause.
Defendants, who are PSC members, move to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that there is no private right of action for Plaintiffs’ preemption' claims and that, even if there were, Plaintiffs’ claims would fail as a matter of law. Notice of Defendants’ Motion to' Dismiss, Dkt. 54. Intervenors, who are the nuclear generators receiving the zero-emissions credits and their owners, also move to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Notice of Motion, Dkt. 76. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS both motions to dismiss.
BACKGROUND2
The Electricity Market
• In- New 'York, wholesale electricity is bought and sold through market-based *560auctions administered by the New York Independent System Operator (“NYISO”). Compl. ¶ 28. The NYISO, which is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), conducts two types of auctions: energy and capacity. Compl. ¶¶ 28-29. Energy auctions are for the purchase and sale of electricity itself, whereas capacity auctions are for the purchase and sale of options to purchase electricity. Compl. ¶36. Retail electricity suppliers, also called load-serving entities (“LSEs”), purchase electricity at wholesale from generators in these auctions. Compl. ¶ 35. Although some of the buyers are located outside New York, most of the buyers are in-state utilities that resell energy at retail to New York customers and businesses. Compl. ¶28. The energy suppliers in the wholesale auction include generators located inside and outside of New York. Compl. ¶ 28.
The NYISO auctions determine electricity prices in the New York wholesale market. Compl. ¶ 27. The auction operates by “stacking” bids from generators for the sale of energy or capacity, beginning with the lowest bid and moving up until demand is satisfied. Compl. ¶¶ 32-33. The price of the highest-stacked bid that satisfies demand is known as the “market clearing price.” Compl. ¶33. Any generator that bids at or below the market-clearing price “clears” the auction and is paid the market-clearing price, regardless of the price the generator actually bid.3 Compl. ¶¶ 33, 39. This pricing mechanism incentivizes generators to be efficient and cost-effective: “it creates price signals for new capacity to enter the market if [the generator] can supply capacity at prices below the clearing price. At the same time, the market provides price signals for existing suppliers to exit the market if they are unable to beat the clearing price.” Compl. ¶ 40 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Nuclear generators, such as Interve-nors, bid as so-called “price-takers” in the NYISO auctions, meaning that they sell their entire output at the market-clearing price. Compl. ¶34. Unlike other types of electricity generators that can adjust their output to produce more or less energy depending on price, nuclear generators run continuously at maximum output. Compl. ¶ 34. Nuclear generators thus sell their entire electricity output into the auctions regardless of the price — even if the price is below their cost of production. Compl. ¶ 34.
Plaintiffs allege that the nuclear generators’ price-taking behavior depresses market-clearing prices because the nuclear generators increase the energy supply available at auction. Compl. ¶ 34. Plaintiffs further allege that all electricity produced by these nuclear generators must be sold in the NYISO energy auctions because they have no alternative way to sell their output. Compl, ¶¶ 34, 64.
New York’s ZEC Program
In order to promote the development of clean energy as part of New York’s effort to stanch global warning, the PSC issued the CES Order. CES Order, Dkt. 76-1. *561The CES Order created two programs: Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) and Zero-Emission Credits (“ZECs”). CES Order at 13-14. The CES Order was adopted in furtherance of New York’s goal to generate fifty percent of its electricity using renewable"" sources by 2030, which supports New York’s broader mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide by forty percent by 2030. CES Order at 2,12.
Tier 1 of the CES Order, which implements the REC program, requires all New York LSEs “to serve their retail customers by procuring new renewable' resources.” CES Order at 14; see also Compl. ¶ 49. Generators that produce energy from renewable sources, like wind or solar, are awarded a credit (a REC) for each megawatt-hour (“MWh”) of renewable-generated electricity produced from renewable resources. Compl. ¶ 49; CES Order at 106. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (“NYSERDA”) purchases RECs from generators, thereby subsidizing their cost of production, and, in turn, sells those RECs to LSEs. CES Order at 16, 107-08. Each LSE is required to purchase RECs in an amount based on a percentage of the total load served by that LSE or make an alternative compliance payment. Compl. ¶ 49; CES Order at 14-16. The cost of the RECs is passed on to commodity custom^ ers. CES Order at 17.
Tier 3 of the CES Order establishes New York’s ZEC program, the .program challenged in this case. CES Order at 19. A ZEC is a “credit for the zero-emissions attributes of one megawatt-hour of electricity production by” an eligible nuclear facility. CES Order, App’x E,- at 1. Through the ZEC program, New York aims to “encourage the preservation of the environmental values or attributes of zero-emissions nuclear-powered electric generating facilities for the benefit of the electric system, its customers and environment.” CES Order, App’x E, at 1.- In particular, the ZEC program ensures that New York’s nuclear generators — which comprise thirty-one percent of New York’s electric generation mix and collectively avoid the emission of over fifteen million tons of carbon dioxide per year— continue to contribute to New York’s electric generation mix pending the development of new renewable energy resources between now and 2030. CES Order at 19. According to the CES Order, losing the nuclear energy contributed by the generators before new renewable resources are developed “would undoubtedly result in significantly increased air emissions” and a “dangerously higher reliance on natural gas”; without the carbon-free attributes of the nuclear generators, New York would have to rely more heavily on existing fossil-fueled energy plants or the construction of new natural gas plants for its electricity, all of which would significantly increase carbon emissions.4 CES Order at *56219. The CES .Order cites Germany as a case-.in .point:- when Germany abruptly closed its nuclear plants following the Fu-kushima nuclear disaster, the electricity that had formerly been produced by nuclear generation was replaced by electricity generated by coal, causing carbon emissions to rise despite a simultaneous and “aggressive” increase in solar generar tion. CES Order at.19.
A nuclear generator is eligible for ZECs if'it makes'a showing of “public necessity,” i.e., the facility’s revenues “are at & level that is insufficient -to provide adequate compensation to preserve the zero-emission environmental values or attributes historically provided by the facility.” Compl. ¶ 67 (quoting CES Order at 124). Any nuclear generator, regardless of its location, is eligible for ZECs, so long as the- generator has historically contributed to' the resource mix of clean energy consumed by New York retail consumers.5 Compl. ¶ 68 (citing CES Order at 124). Pursuant to the CES Order, the nuclear generators sell their ZECs to NYSERDA at a price administratively determined by the PSC. Compl. ¶ 69. LSEs are required to purchase ZECs from NYSERDA in an amount proportional to their customers’ share of the total energy consumed in New York.6 CES Order at 20,151; Compl. ¶ 73. The LSEs pass the costs of their ZEC purchases. to their customers, the retail ratepayers, CES Order at 20; Compl, ¶ 73.
ZEC prices are calculated by the PSC using the federal estimate of the social cost of carbon and a forecast of wholesale electricity prices.7 Compl. ¶71 (citing CES Order at Í31). Specifically, for a two-year period, the price of each ZEC is'the social cost of carbon less the generator’s putative value of avoided greenhouse gas emissions less the amount of the forecast energy price. Compl, ¶¶ 70-71 (citing CES Order at 13Í). Put differently, if the forecast wholesale price of electricity increases, the price of a ZEC decreases. Compl. ¶ 71. For the first two years of the ZEC program, *563from April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2019, the PSC has set the ZEC price at $17.48 per MWh. Compl. ¶ 70. Thus, “each qualifying nuclear generator will get an additional $17.48 for .each MWh of electricity it generates (subject to a possible cap), in addition to the price.the facility receives for the sale of the electricity and capacity in the [NYSIO] market.” Compl. ¶ 70.
Plaintiffs .allege that under the ZEC program, the nuclear generators eligible for ZECs effectively receive a higher price for their energy than they would have without the ZEC program and that the ZEC subsidies distort the market-clearing price in the NYISO auctions. Compl. ¶¶ 43-45. Plaintiffs allege that because the ZEC program allows the eligible nuclear generators to participate in the NYISO auctions when they otherwise would have gone out of business, New York “is using the ZEC subsidy to exert a large depressive effect on energy and capacity prices, which one group of experts estimated at $15 billion. over 12 years.” Compl, ¶ 47. According to Plaintiffs, this depressive effect will cause generators, including Plaintiffs, to receive a lower price than they otherwise would have received and will cause their bids to fail to clear the auctions when they otherwise would have cleared. Compl. ¶¶ 74, 81, 87.
Plaintiffs claim that the ZEC program is preempted under the FPA and that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause. Defendants and Intervenors move to dismiss, arguing that: Plaintiffs lack a private right of action to pursue their preemption claims in federal court; the ZEC program is not preempted; and the ZEC program does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause; For the following reasons, the Court holds that Plaintiffs may not raise their preemption claims pursuant to the Court’s equity jurisdiction; that the ZEC program is neither field nor conflict preempted; and that the ZEC program does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.
DISCUSSION8
In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court accepts all of the non-movant’s factual allegations as true and' draws all reasonable inferences in the non-movant’s favor, See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Although all factual allegations contained in the complaint are assumed to be true, this tenet is “inapplicable to legal conclusions.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the complaint must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id, .
I. EQUITY JURISDICTION
The Supremacy Clause does riot create a cause of action for preemption claims, Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1378, 1383, 191 L.Ed.2d 471 (2015), and Plaintiffs do not argue that the FPA itself creates a private *564right of action. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ preemption claims are dependent on this Court having equity jurisdiction over the claims.
Since Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), “the Supreme Court has consistently recognized federal [equity] jurisdiction over declaratory — and injunctive — relief actions to prohibit the enforcement of state or municipal orders alleged to violate federal law.” Friends of the E. Hampton Airport, Inc. v. Town of E. Hampton, 841 F.3d 133, 144 (2d Cir. 2016) (collecting cases). Nevertheless, federal courts’ “equity [jurisdiction] to enjoin unlawful executive action is subject to express and implied statutory limitations.” Armstrong, 135 S.Ct. at 1385. The FPA does not expressly preclude actions in equity, but the parties contest whether Congress implicitly intended to foreclose equitable relief under the FPA.
In Armstrong, the Supreme Court held that Congress implicitly foreclosed equitable relief under Section 30(A) of the Medicaid Act, which healthcare providers sought to enforce by enjoining state officials from reimbursing medical service providers at rates lower than the federal statute required. 135 S.Ct. at 1382, 1385. The Armstrong Court reasoned that Congress intended to foreclose equitable relief because (1) pursuant to the Medicaid Act, “the sole remedy” for a State’s failure to comply with the Medicaid Act’s requirements was the withholding of Medicaid funds by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and (2) Section 30(A), which mandates that States provide for payments that are “consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care” while “safeguarding] against unnecessary utilization of ... care and services,” was judicially unadministrable. Id. at 1385 (alteration in Armstrong). According to the Supreme Court, the combination of those two features means that Congress intended to preclude private enforcement in equity of Section 30(A). Id. (“Explicitly conferring enforcement of this judgment-laden standard upon the Secretary alone establishes ... that Congress ‘wanted to make the agency remedy that it provided exclusive,’ ....” (quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 292, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002) (Breyer, J., concurring))).
In Friends of the East Hampton Airport, the Second Circuit applied Armstrong’s two criteria to the Airport Noise and Capacity Act (“ANCA”) in considering whether Congress intended to foreclose equitable relief; the Second Circuit held that Congress did not so intend. 841 F.3d at 145-47. Under ANCA, there is no “sole remedy” because ANCA not only provides for the loss of federal funding as a penalty for violating ANCA but also grants the Secretary of Transportation authority to pursue appropriate legal remedies, including injunctive relief. Id. at 145-46 (citing 49 U.S.C. §§ 47526, 47533). The Second Circuit reasoned that “[t]he fact that Congress conferred such broad enforcement authority on the [Federal Aviation Administration], and not on private parties, does not imply its intent to bar such parties from invoking federal jurisdiction where, as here, they do so not to enforce the federal law themselves, but to preclude a municipal entity from subjecting them to local laws enacted in violation of federal requirements.”9 Id. at 146. The Second *565Circuit also held that ANCA was judicially administrable because it set forth a simple rule — namely, that airports seeking to impose noise restrictions on certain types of aircraft must obtain the consent of aircraft operators or the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration. Id. at 146-47 (citing 49 U.S.C. § 47524(c)).
The FPA tacitly forecloses private parties from invoking equity jurisdiction to challenge state laws enacted in alleged violation of the FPA because Congress implicitly provided a “sole remedy” in the FPA — specifically, enforcement by FERC. Similar to ANCA, the FPA grants FERC broad enforcement authority. For example, the FPA grants FERC discretion to bring an action in federal district court to enjoin any person violating the FPA or to enforce compliance. 16 U.S.C. § 825m(a). The FPA also requires every public utility to file with FERC rates'for all sales Subject to FERC’s jurisdiction and empowers FERC to hold hearings to examine new or changed rates, to suspend rates, and to determine rates. 16 U.S.C. §§ 824d(c)-(e), 824e(a). Finally, the FPA authorizes any person to file a complaint with FERC to challenge, inter alia, anything done by a regulated entity in contravention of the FPA. 16 U.S.C. §§ 824e(a), 825e. But, unlike ANCA, Congress provided for a narrow private cause of action under the FPA in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (“PURPA”), which authorizes private parties to challenge’ state rules governing small power production facilities, after first exhausting their administrative remedies. 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3(h)(2)(B). Congress’s decision to create a limited private cause of action suggests that “the omission of a general private right of action in the [FPA] should ... be understood as intentional.” Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, No. 17 CV 1163, 2017 WL 3008289, at *9 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017); see Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 290, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (“The express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that ■ Congress intended to preclude others.”); Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 147, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985) (“[W]here a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted omitted))."" Thus, the FPA precludes private enforcement except as provided for by PURPA, and private parties such as Plaintiffs “cannot, by invoking [the Court’s] equitable powers, circumvent Congress’s exclusion of private enforcement.” Armstrong, 135 S.Ct. at 1385.
The second indicator of congressional intent to preclude equitable relief to a private litigant, according to Armstrong, is the. presence of a judicially unadministra-ble standard. The FPA’s requirement that wholesale electricity rates be just and reasonable, 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a), is not judicially unadministrable.10 The fact that *566courts must “afford great deference” to FERC in its determination of just and reasonable rates, Morgan Stanley Capital Grp. Inc. v. Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., Wash., 554 U.S. 527, 532, 128 S.Ct. 2733, 171 L.Ed.2d 607 (2008), does not mean that the determination of just and reasonable rates is judicially unadministrable — courts - may, defer to' FERC’s determination, but they do not abstain from all judgment regarding.what constitutes a just and reasonable rate, see, e.g., id. at 545-46, 128 S.Ct. 2733 (the Supreme Court in Fed. Power Comm’n v. Sierra Pac. Power Co., 350 U.S. 348, 76 S.Ct. 368, 100 L.Ed. 388 (1956), “provided a definition of what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context”); Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. FERC, 783 F.3d 92, 109-11 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding that FERC’s determination of just and reasonable rates was adequately supported anil not unreasonable); Mont. Consumer Counsel v. FERC, 659 F.3d 910, 918 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The Supreme Court has long held that the statutory command that rates be ‘just and' reasonable’ means that courts must balance ‘the investor and the consumer interests,’ and ‘[i]f the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry ... is at an end.’” (quoting Fed. Power Comm’n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 602-03, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944))). Indeed, by allowing FERC to file federal lawsuits, 16 U.S.C. § 825m(a), Congress necessarily anticipated that courts might have to oversee the enforcement of the just and reasonable rate standard, albeit with deference to FERC.11
In sum, the Court finds that the first but not the second of Armstrong’s factors indicates that Congress intended to preclude equitable relief to private parties. There is no indication in Armstrong that both factors must be satisfied in order to conclude that Congress intended to foreclose equitable- relief to private parties. To the contrary, the Supreme Court in Armstrong considered the second factor — judicial ad-ministrability — in the event the provision authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enforce the statute by withholding funds “might not, by itself, preclude the availability of equitable relief.” 135 S.Ct. at 1385. The limited private right of action provided by PURPA is by itself sufficient to establish that Congress intended to foreclose equitable relief. Between-a statute that establishes a narrow private cause of action allowing private lawsuits in some but hot most cases and a statute that establishes a specific administrative remedy, the former indicates more clearly, than the latter that Congress chose to eliminate general equitable relief for private parties. The issue of creating a private cause of action was squarely before *567Congress when it drafted and enacted the former provision, whereas Congress did not necessarily consider the possibility of a private right of action in drafting and enacting the latter provision. This Court can, therefore, more confidently infer that Congress intended to foreclose a private right of action in equity in the former scenario than in the latter. Accordingly, this Court does not have equity jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ FPA preemption claims. Nevertheless, even if the Plaintiffs could invoke the Court’s equity jurisdiction, for the reasons provided below, Plaintiffs’ preemption claims would fail.
II. PREEMPTION
The Supremacy Clause provides that the laws of the United States “shall be the supreme Law of the Land ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. In other words, “federal law preempts contrary state law.” Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1297.
In considering a federal law’s preemptive effect, “the ultimate touchstone” is Congress’s purpose in enacting the law. Id. at 1297 (quoting Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 566 U.S. 70, 76, 129 S.Ct. 538, 172 L.Ed.2d 398 (2008)). Relatedly, in determining whether a state law is preempted, the Court must “consider[ j the target at which the state law aims."" Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1591, 1599, 191 L.Ed.2d 511 (2015) (emphases in original).
State laws may be either “field” or “conflict” preempted. Field preemption exists where “Congress has forbidden the State to take, action in the field that the federal statute pre-empts.” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1595. In such circumstances, “Congress may have intended to foreclose any state regulation in the area, irrespective of whether state law is consistent or inconsistent .with federal standards.” Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Conflict preemption, by contrast, “exists where compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of . the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Id. (citation and internal- quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiffs allege that the CES Order is both field and conflict preempted by the FPA, For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that it is neither.12
A. Field Preemption
The FPA is a paragon of cooperative federalism; it divides responsibility for the regulation of energy between state and federal regulators. See Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1292. For statutes such as the FPA, “where ‘coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for federal pre-emption becomes a less persuasive one.’” Id. at 1300 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quoting New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 421, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973)).
FERC, on behalf of the' federal government, has exclusive authority “to regulate ‘the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce’ and ‘the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.’’” FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass’n (hereafter, “EPSA”), — U.S. -, *568136 S.Ct. 760, 767, 193 L.Ed.2d 661 (2016) (quoting 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1)).13 Particularly relevant here, FERC also has the authority “to ensure that rules or practices ‘affecting* wholesale rates are just and reasonable.” Id. at 774 (discussing 16 U.S.C. § 824e(a)); see also 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a). This “affecting” jurisdiction is limited to rules or practices that “directly affect the wholesale rate.” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 774 (internal marks and citation omitted). “Indirect or tangential impacts on wholesale electricity rates” do not suffice; otherwise, the FPA’s grant of jurisdiction to FERC would “assum[e] near-infinite breadth.” Id.
Although FERC has substantial authority over interstate wholesale energy sales, the regulation of retail rates for sales of electricity belongs to the States. Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1292. Within the zone of exclusive state jurisdiction are “within-state wholesale sales” and “retail sales of electricity (i.e., sales directly to users).” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 768. States also retain jurisdiction “over facilities used for the generation of electric energy.” 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1). As discussed supra, to determine whether a State is regulating retail or wholesale rates, the Court must consider the target of the state law. Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1599.14
1. Unconstitutional “Tethering” Under Hughes
The Supreme Court recently grappled with the issue of preemption under the FPA in Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, — U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1288, 194 L.Ed.2d 414 (2016). In Hughes, the Court concluded that a Maryland energy program was preempted because it imper-missibly “set[] an interstate wholesale rate, contravening the FPA’s division of authority between state and federal regulators.” 136 S.Ct. at 1297. The Maryland program, which obliged Maryland LSEs to enter into a contract-for-differences with a favored generator, required the favored generator to participate in the wholesale capacity auction, but guaranteed that generator the more favorable contract price (rather than the market-clearing price) for its energy. Id. at 1294-95, 1297. Importantly, the generator’s receipt of the subsidy was explicitly contingent on the generator’s sale of capacity into the wholesale auction: if the generator’s capacity cleared the auction, and the market-clearing price was below the price stipulated in the contract-for differences, the LSEs paid the generator the difference between the contract price and the clearing price. Id. at 1295. The generator did not receive the subsidy if its capacity failed to clear the auction. Id. Because the Maryland program conditioned the generator’s receipt of the subsidy on the generator’s participation in the auction, but guaranteed the generator a rate distinct from the market-clearing price, Hughes concluded that the Maryland program “adjusted] an interstate wholesale rate” and was accordingly preempted. Id. at 1297.
Hughes, however, left open the possibility for States to “encourag[e] production of new or clean generation through measures ‘untethered to a generator’s wholesale market participation.’ ” Id. at 1299 (citation omitted). In doing so, the Supreme Court declined to address the permissibility of other State measures to incentivize clean *569energy, such as “tax incentives, land grants, direct subsidies, construction of state-owned generation facilities,, or re-regulation of the energy sector.” Id. Hughes emphasized: “So long as a State does not condition payment of funds on capacity clearing the auction, the State’s program would not suffer from the fatal defect that renders Maryland’s program unacceptable.” Id.
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is preempted under Hughes because, like the challenged Maryland program, the ZEC program is “tethered” to the wholesale auction. Plaintiffs argue that there is an impermissible tether because: (1) a nuclear generator is eligible for a ZEC only if the NYISO auction rates are insufficient for the generator to stay in business; (2) ZEC prices are calculated using forecast wholesale rates; and (3) the nuclear generators receiving the ZECs sell all of their power directly into the auction markets. Opp. 19-22; Oral Arg. Tr. (hereafter, “Tr.”) 22:2-23:22, 32:16-34:14, Dkt. 141 (Mar. 29, 2017). Unsurprisingly, Defendants and Intervenors dispute all of these arguments. The Court agrees with Defendants and Intervenors.
The Court is not convinced by Plaintiffs’ first argument. A whole host of measures that States might employ to encourage clean energy development — such as tax incentives or direct subsidies — involve propping up the operation of a generator that might otherwise be unprofitable. Hughes did not prohibit such state assistance, see Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299, and Plaintiffs have not argued that such state subsidies are per se preempted.
Nor does the use of forecast wholesale rates in calculating the ZEC price create an unconstitutional tether. Hughes clearly stated 'that the impermissible tether was “to a generator’s wholesale market participation,” id, at 1299 (emphasis added), and nowhere stated, implied or even considered that a State program’s incorporation of the wholesale market price would provide a basis for preemption.15 Plaintiffs have not provided any persuasive argument why using wholesale prices, actual or forecast, as' a metric for calculating the price of a ZEC creates a tether that leads to preemption.
Rochester Gas & Electric Corp. v. PSC, 754 F.2d 99 (2d Cir. 1985) forecloses Plaintiffs’ attempt to hook preemption to price. Rochester Gas concluded that the State’s consideration of a “reasonable estimate” of wholesale sales revenue in calculating intrastate"" retail rates (an area of State jurisdiction) did not render the state program at issue preempted. 754 F.2d at 100-01, 105. The Second Circuit found “a distinction between, on the one hand, regulating [wholesale] sales, and on the other, reflecting the profits from a reasonable estimate *570of those sales in jurisdictional rates.” Id, at 105. Plaintiffs attempt to' distinguish Rochester Gas by noting that Rochester Gas involved regulation at the retail level, Tr. 31:24-32:8, 48:6-10, but that is a distinction without a difference. Regulation of retail rates, like the regulation of environmental attributes, is within the zone, of state jurisdiction, and Rochester Gas held that merely considering or incorporating wholesale prices in rate-setting for a state-regulated activity does not , intrude upon federal authority.16 Rochester Gas, 754 F.2d at 105 (New York “may impute revenue from a reasonable estimate of [wholesale] sales” in considering the generator’s retail revenue).
Plaintiffs also argue that the ZEC program is directly tied to the wholesale auction because “[a]ll electricity produced by these nuclear generators must be sold directly or indirectly in the NYISO auctions, as there are no alternative. markets.” Compl. ¶ 64; see also Tr. 22:7-8 (“[T]he nuclear plants[ ] have no alternative but to sell their output in the energy auction .... ”). Plaintiffs highlight that the nuclear generators are “price takers,” Tr. 22:8, and that the nuclear generators “are exempt wholesale generators under the Public Utility Holding Act [ (“PUHA”) ],” which, according to Plaintiffs, requires the generators to sell all of their power and capacity into the wholesale auction. Tr. 22:10-16.
This argument is no more than an attempt to fashion a “tether” by jamming a square peg into a round hole; Plaintiffs’ argument rewrites the CES Order. The CES Order itself does not require the nuclear generators to sell into the NYISO auction. As discussed supra, the nuclear generators' receive ZECs for their zero-emissions production of energy, and not for the sale of that energy into the wholesale market; the CES Order grants ZECs to eligible nuclear generators, without any mention of whether or where the generators sell their power. See CES Order at 124-29 (discussing criteria for generators to receive ZECs). In that respect, the ZEC program is critically different from the challenged program in Hughes, which specifically conditioned subsidy payments on the generator’s sale of capacity into the auction. See Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1295, 1297, 1299.
Even accepting as true Plaintiffs’ allegation that the generators do, as a matter of fact, sell their entire output into the auction, see Compl. ¶64, that is a business decision; it is not a requirement imposed by New York. Plaintiffs have not cited, and the Court has not been able to find, any case in which a state program has been found to be field preempted based on a private business decision rather than a state directive. What the' generators choose to do, as a matter of their business organization or as a product of their business decisions, is irrelevant from a preemption perspective. See Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *13 (finding the ZEC program not preempted because “the ZEC program does not mandate auction clearing ... and the state, while taking advantage of these attributes to confer a benefit on nuclear power, is not imposing a condition directly on wholesale transactions”). -
*571The fact that the nuclear generators currently claim status as exempt wholesale generators under PUHA is similarly irrelevant. Intervenors note that PUHA permits generators to withdraw their wholesale generator status, 18 C.F.R. § 366.7(c)(3),17 but even if PUHA did not permit withdrawal and did require the generators to sell entirely, into the auction, the critical point is that New York has not required the generators to participate in the auction: nothing about the CES Order tethers the generators’, receipt of ZECs to their sale of energy into the auction. Put differently, a change in PUHA would not unravel the CES Order or interfere with New York’s ZEC program. That is why PUHA is a red herring. The law of preemption examines state action and considers whether state action has intruded upon the federal government’s turf. It cannot be disputed that the CES Order does not require the generators to sell into the auction — that is, it does not tether the generators’ receipt of ZECs to their participation in the auction. It is that aspect of the CES Order that saves the ZEC program from the problems faced in Hughes.
In summary, the Maryland program at issue in Hughes conditioned the' generators’ receipt of a favorable rate (distinct from the auction rate) on the generators’ capacity clearing the auction; there was a direct and concrete tie (or tether) between the contracts-for-difference and the generator’s wholesale market participation. Here, a ZEC is available based on the environmental attributes of the energy production — specifically, for-' the generators’ production of zero-emissions energy — without consideration of the generators’ participation in the auction. Like the challenged Connecticut program in Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2017), the ZEC program does not suffer from Hughes’s “fatal defect” because the ZEC program “does not condition capacity transfers on [the wholesale] auction.” 861 F.3d at 99. Rather, the purchase or sale of ZECs, like the contracts at issue in the Connecticut program, reflect transactions that occur “independent of the auction.” Id.
2. ZECs Do Not Directly Adjust, Alter, or Affect the Wholesale Rate . ■
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is preempted because “the ZEC payments directly alter the wholesale price paid by LSEs and received by the nuclear generators.” Opp. 19. They argue that by guaranteeing nuclear generators greater total compensation (i,e., the auction clearing price plus the value of its ZECs) than what they will receive at auction (clearing price only), the ZEC program disregards interstate wholesale rates that FERC has deemed just and reasonable. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that ZECs artificially depress the auction market-clearing price by allowing the nuclear generators to continue to participate as price-takers, thus increasing the supply of energy and thereby reducing the wholesale price.
Plaintiffs’ argument commits the logical fallacy of concluding that state'actions that affect the wholesale price in some way are the same as state actions that set the wholesale rate. In EPSA, the Supreme Court stated that “[t]o set a retail electrici*572ty rate is ... to establish the amount of money a consumer will hand over in exchange for power.” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 777. Although EPSA was addressing retail rates, this Court sees no principled basis— in the statutory text, EPSA’s discussion or otherwise — to conclude that the definition of “to set a rate” is different in the retail and wholesale contexts. Moreover, the EPSA definition is consistent with Hughes. Hughes concluded that the Maryland program did adjust and “set” an interstate wholesale rate because the program “required [the generator] to participate in the □capacity auction, but guarantees [the generator] a rate distinct from the clearing price for its interstate sales of capacity.” Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1297. Here, the ZEC sales and the wholesale sales of energy or capacity are entirely separate transactions, with the ZEC sales occurring independently of the wholesale auction and neither one conditioned on the other. Therefore, the ZEC program does not adjust or “set” the amount of money that a generator receives in exchange for the generator’s sale of energy or capacity into the auction.
Nor is the ZEC program preempted because of the ZECs’ effects on the wholesale auction. FERC has jurisdiction over “rules or practices that directly affect the [wholesale] rate,” EPSA, 136 S.Ct. at 774 (alterations in original) (citation and quotation marks omitted), but “indirect or tangential impacts on wholesale electricity rates” fall outside FERC jurisdiction, id. Even if ZECs have an effect on the wholesale auction — which Plaintiffs allege and the Court must accept as true — Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the ZECs directly affect wholesale rates such that they intrude upon federal jurisdiction.
In Allco, the Second Circuit squarely rejected the argument that the fact that the challenged contracts would “increase the supply of electricity available to Connecticut utilities,” thereby exerting “downward pressure ... that will have an effect on wholesale prices,” meant that the Connecticut contracts “infring[ed] upon FERC’s regulatory authority.” Allco, 861 F.3d at 101. The Second Circuit concluded that any such effect on wholesale prices was “incidental” and did not “amount to a regulation of the interstate wholesale electricity market that infringes on FERC’s jurisdiction.” Id. Plaintiffs here allege that ZECs affect wholesale prices by exerting pressure on the market forces that play out in the wholesale auction, but they, too, fail to state a plausible claim that ZECs directly affect wholesale rates. Like the Allco contracts, ZECs have only an incidental effect on wholesale rates and thus do not intrude upon FERC jurisdiction.
Fatal to Plaintiffs’ argument is their failure to offer any cogent explanation why ZECs are preempted but other state incentives to generate clean energy — such as tax exemptions, land grants, or direct financial subsidies — are not. Such incentives also allow clean energy generators to be more competitive than they would otherwise be, and they therefore also affect price signals in the wholesale auction. Plaintiffs even concede that such measures “would have some of the same effects” on the market. Tr. 26:2-3.
Hughes declined to rule on the permissibility of such state-incentive measures, see Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299 (“We ... need not and do not address the permissibility of various other measures States might employ to encourage development of new or clean generation, including tax incentives, land grants, [and] direct subsidies .... ”), and Plaintiffs do not argue here that such incentives are per se impermissible, Tr. 25:22-26:4 (acknowledging that “if New York decided to just write a check to a nuclear plant, that would have some of the same effects”). Hughes made *573clear that it did not mean to discourage States from incentivizing clean energy-generation so long as the measures taken are not tethered to a generator’s wholesale market participation. Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299. The Supreme Court implicitly acknowledged that state actions to encourage clean energy production may make price signals from the auction less relevant. Id. (citing Respondents’ discussion that States may make the price signals in the auction “less relevant by subsidizing new generation,” Brief for Respondents 40). Other than their theories of “tethering,” which this Court has already rejected, Plaintiffs offer no explanation for why the effects of ZECs on price signals in the auction are any different from, for example, the effects a tax incentive given to the nuclear plants would have on those same price signals. There may (or may not) be a difference in degree, but there is no difference in kind.
The death knell for Plaintiffs’ field-preemption argument is their failure to distinguish ZECs from RECs. In WSPP, FERC concluded that RECs fall outside FERC jurisdiction because they are -state-created certifications of an energy attribute that are unbundled from wholesale energy sales. WSPP, Inc., 139 FERC P 61061, 2012 WL 1395532, ¶¶18, 21, 24 (FERC Apr. 20, 2012). WSPP held that these unbundled transactions did not affect wholesale rates and were not “in connection with” wholesale sales of electricity. Id. ¶ 24; see also Allco, 861 F.3d at 93 (“RECs are inventions of state property law whereby the renewable energy attributes are ‘unbundled’ from the energy itself and sold separately.” (quoting Wheelabrator Lisbon Inc. v. Conn. Dep’t of Pub. Util. Control, 531 F.3d 183, 186 (2d Cir. 2008))). Curiously, Plaintiffs argue that WSPP supports their position.
Plaintiffs argue that WSPP does not foreclose their preemption claim because WSPP noted that a wholesale sale that “requires the use of an emissions allowance” is subject to FERC jurisdiction because such a transaction would directly affect and be “in connection with” the wholesale rate, WSPP ¶¶ 22-23. Plaintiffs argue that because the ZEC program requires that LSEs purchase ZECs in proportion to the electric energy load that they serve, Compl. ¶73, ZECs are not “unbundled” from wholesale sales as RECs are. Opp. 28-29.
Plaintiffs’ argument fails given the allegations in their own Complaint: the REC program also requires that LSEs purchase RECs in proportion to their total electricity load or to make a compliance payment. Compl. ¶ 49; CES Order at 14, 16. That LSEs may make a REC compliance payment, but no analogous ZEC compliance payment exists, is immaterial; the REC program, like the ZEC program, requires that LSEs make a proportional payment. See CES' Order at 109-10. Like RECs, ZECs are credits for the environmental attributes of energy production. Like the sales of RECs, sales of ZECs are unbundled from wholesale sales for energy or capacity. If RECs are not preempted (and WSPP makes clear that they are not), then the Court fails to see how ZECs are.
Plaintiffs further argue that RECs are distinguishable from ZECs because: REC prices are not calculated using forecast wholesale prices, Opp. 30-31; RECs are available to all generators, not just a favored few, Opp. 31; and ZECs are not unbundled from or “independent- of other ‘attributes’ ” of the eligible generators because the generators receive ZECs based on their inability to remain profitable from wholesale market sales, Opp. 31. See also, Compl. ¶¶ 50-51. For these reasons, Plaintiffs claim that “the REC is different and is not subject to the same issues,” Tr. *57421:6-7; see also Tr. 31:4-6 (“You don’t have that tie for the RECs”). *
Although there are factual differences between ZECs and RECs, none is legally significant. As discussed above, the fact that the ZEC price is calculated using a forecast of wholesale prices does not ipean that the ZEC program is preempted. Nothing in WSPP considered the REC pricing mechanism to be constitutionally significant; indeed, WSPP did not even explicitly address how RECs were priced.18 That RECs are available to any energy producer that uses renewable sources, whereas ZECs are available only to energy producers that satisfy certain other requirements does not pose a preemption concern.19 Plaintiffs cite no cases supporting their theory that subsidizing only a few generators is problematic from a preemption perspective. Plaintiffs’ creative rephrasing of “unbundled” as “independent of other ‘attributes’ ” also is unavailing. WSPP held that the “unbundled REC transaction” was not preempted because it was “independent of a wholesale electric energy transaction.” WSPP ¶24 (emphasis added). WSPP nowhere said that RECs were not preempted because they were independent of other attributes.
Like a REC, a. ZEC is a certification of an energy attribute that is separate from a wholesale charge or rate. Like a REC, the purchase or. sale of a ZEC is the purchase or sale of this attribute, rather than the purchase or sale of wholesale energy. Like a REC, the purchase or sale of a ZEC is independent of the purchase or sale of wholesale energy. Like a REC, payment for a ZEC is not conditioned on the generator’s participation in the wholesale auction; rather, RECs and ZECs are given in exchange for the renewable energy or zero-emissions production of energy by generators. Compl. ¶ 64 (“payment of ZEC subsidies occurs if, and only if, the nuclear generator ‘produces’ electricity”); CES Order, App’x E at 1. Because of these similarities between ZECs and RECs, the effect of ZE.Cs on the wholesale auction is legally indistinguishable from the effect of RECs on the wholesale auction.20 FERC has clearly held that RECs are not preempted. The Court cannot find any principled basis to hold that the ZEC program is preempted even though its sibling REC program is not.
3. Plaintiffs’ Attempt to Analogize to Other Preempted State Measures Is Unpersuasive
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program’s effect on wholesale prices is “far greater” than the effects of programs held preempt*575ed in Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293, 108 S.Ct. 1145, 99 L.Ed.2d 316 (1988), Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 108 S.Ct. 2428, 101 L.Ed.2d 322 (1988), Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953, 106 S.Ct. 2349, 90 L.Ed.2d 943 (1986), and Northern Natural Gas Company v. State Corporation Commission of Kansas, 372 U.S. 84, 83 S.Ct. 646, 9 L.Ed.2d 601 (1963). The Court disagrees. Those cases • all involved obvious state intrusions into the federal government’s area of responsibility that are absent from the ZEC program. In Oneok, the Supreme Court made clear that the Schneidewind program was preempted because the state law was “directed at ... the control of rates and facilities of natural gas companies ... precisely the things over which FERC has comprehensive authority.” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1600 (quoting Schneidewind, 485 U.S. at 308, 108 S.Ct. 1145). The Court found that the Schneide-wind program “was designed to keep a natural gas company from raising its equity levels above a certain point in order to keep the company’s revenue requirement low, thereby ensuring lower wholesale rates.” Id. (citing Schneidewind, 485 U.S. at 307-08, 108 S.Ct. 1145). As discussed supra, and unlike in Schneidewind, the ZEC program is not directed at and does not directly affect wholesale rates.
Mississippi Power and Nantahala also do not help Plaintiffs’ case. In Mississippi Power, which is a conflict (not field) preemption case, the State barred the utility from recovering costs that the utility was required to pay under a FERC order mandating a certain allocation of power. Mississippi Power, 487 U.S. at 373-74, 108 S.Ct. 2428. The Supreme Court concluded that “Mississippi’s inquiry into the reasonableness of FERC-approved purchases” was preempted by FERC. Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1601-02 (discussing Mississippi Power). Similarly, in Nantahala, which also is a conflict preemption case and a case on which Mississippi Power relied, a State commission prevented the utility from recovering the costs incurred in paying the wholesale rate for a FERC-man-dated allocation of power. Mississippi Power, 487 U.S. at 370-71, 108 S.Ct. 2428 (discussing Nantahala). As in Nantahala, the Supreme Court held that the State commission’s action-was preempted. Id. at 370-73, 108 S.Ct. 2428 (discussing Nant-ahala). Here, the ZEC program does not challenge or seek to re-determine the reasonableness of the wholesale rate. Rather, ZECs are payments for the environmental attributes of zero-emission energy. Unlike the challenged state laws in Mississippi Power and Nantahala, and despite Plaintiffs’ protestations otherwise, the ZEC program is simply not tethered to the wholesale rate.
Lastly, Northern Natural Gas is simply inapposite. In that case, Kansas required the ratable purchase of gas from a particular gas field. N. Nat. Gas, 372 U.S. at 85-86, 83 S.Ct. 646. The Supreme Court held that Kansas’ orders were preempted because they were “unambiguously directed at purchasers who take gas in Kansas for resale .after transportation ip interstate commerce” and thereby invaded federal jurisdiction “over the sale and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce for resale.” Id. at 90-92, 83 S.Ct. 646 (Kan-sas orders “directly affect[ed] the ability of the Federal Power Commission to regulate comprehensively and effectively the transportation and sale of natural gas, and to achieve the uniformity of regulation, which was an objective of the Natural Gas Act.”). Unlike in Northern Natural Gas, the ZEC program does not order utilities to make any purchases of energy or capacity, let alone, from any particular electricity source.
*576In sum, the Court concludes that the ZEC program is not field preempted. By establishing a program that does not condition or tether ZEC payments to wholesale auction participation, New York has successfully threaded the needle left by Hughes that allows States to adopt innovative programs to encourage the production of clean energy. See Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1299. For the foregoing reasons, the Complaint does not state a plausible claim of field preemption.
B. Conflict Preemption
Conflict preemption “exists where compliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1595 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “State regulation of production may be pre-empted as conflicting with FERC’s authority over interstate transportation and rates if it is impossible to comply with both state and federal law; if state regulation prevents attainment of FERC’s goals; or if a state regulation’s impact on matters within federal control is not an incident of efforts to achieve a proper state purpose.” Nw. Cent. Pipeline Corp. v. State Corp. Comm’n of Kansas, 489 U.S. 493, 515-16, 109 S.Ct. 1262, 103 L.Ed.2d 509 (1989). Where, as here, conflict preemption is alleged based on the obstacle presented by state law to the federal purpose and objective, “[w]hat constitutes a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.” In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., 725 F.3d 65, 101 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also PPL EnergyPlus, LLC v. Nazarian, 753 F.3d 467, 478 (4th Cir. 2014) (same).
In “a system of ‘interlocking’ [state and federal] jurisdiction” like the FPA, Nazarian, 753 F.3d at 478; see also Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1300 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), “conflict preemption analysis must be applied sensitively ... so as to prevent the diminution of the role Congress reserved to the States while at the same time preserving the federal role,” Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 515, 109 S.Ct. 1262. When state law has an impact on matters within FERC’s control, “the State’s purpose must be to regulate production or other subjects of state jurisdiction, and the means chosen must at least plausibly be related to matters of legitimate state concern.” Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 518, 109 S.Ct. 1262. A state law “creates a conflict rather than demands an accommodation” when the State is attempting to regulate a matter of federal concern in the guise of regulating a matter of state concern. Id. But when the State is legitimately regulating a matter of state concern, “FERC’s exercise of its authority must accommodate” that state regulation “[ujnless clear damage to federal goals would result.” Id. at 522, 109 S.Ct. 1262.
Plaintiffs argue that the ZEC program is conflict preempted because it causes “clear damage” to and “interferes with FERC’s regulatory objective” of maintaining competitive energy markets. Opp. 32-33. Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program “disrupts] market signals” and “interferes with FERC’s decision to structure the wholesale markets ... on market-based principles” to encourage the maintenance of efficient generators. Compl. ¶¶ 88-89. Plaintiffs further argue that conflict preemption presents a factual issue inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss. Opp. 34.
Defendants and Intervenors respond that the ZEC program is consistent with FERC’s policy statements and that NYT-*577SO,- which administers FERC’s markets in New York, has endorsed the ZEC program. 'Defs. Mem. 8-9; Intervenors Mem. 19-20. Intervenors further note that if .the ZEC program were interfering with federal objectives, “FERC has abundant steps it could take but has chosen to take none of them,” Tr. 15:21-22, To the contrary, as Intervenors note, FERC has concluded that state programs that incentivize clean energy generation are consistent with FERC’s policy objectives. Intervenors Mem. 19 (collecting FERC decisions).
Accepting the Complaint’s factual allegations as true, as the Court must at this stage, the Complaint does not state a plausible claim of conflict preemption. The ZEC program is plainly related to a matter of legitimate state concern: the production of clean energy and the. reduction of carbon emissions from the production of other energy. Thus, in the interlocking jurisdictional scheme provided by the FPA, there is no. conflict preemption “[u]n-less clear damage to federal goals would result.” Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 522, 109 S.Ct. 1262.
Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program “interferes with FERC’s decision to structure the wholesale markets ... on market-based principles” to encourage efficient generators. Compl. ¶ 89. Accepting as true that one of FERC’s goals .is to promote market efficiency through energy auctions, there is no conflict. The ZEC program does not run afoul of the goal of having an efficient energy market. Instead, by incen-tivizing clean energy production, it seeks to minimize the environmental damage that is done by generating electricity through the -use of gas and fossil fuels. CES Order at 19. Far from objecting to state programs that encourage energy production with certain desirable environmental attributes, FERC has approved state programs with “renewable portfolio mandates and greenhouse reduction goals.”. See, e.g., Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 123 FERC P 61067, 2008 WL 1780603, ¶ 34 (FERC Apr. 21, 2008). The ZEC program does not thwart the goal of an efficient energy market; rather, it encourages through financial incentives the production of clean energy.
Plaintiffs’ only remaining allegations relative to their conflict preemption claim are that ZECs “will disrupt market signals” within the auction, Compl. ¶ 88, and that “the ZECs will have market-distorting ripple effects throughout the national market and beyond New York’s borders,” Compl. ¶ 90. Accepting these factual allegations as true, Plaintiffs have not stated a plausible claim of conflict preemption.
Plaintiffs’ core complaint is that the ZEC program will permit certain nuclear generators to continue to participate in the energy market when they otherwise would have gone out of business.21 Compl. ¶ 58. But, as discussed supra, Allco concluded that the fact that the Connecticut program would “increase the supply of electricity,” thereby affecting wholesale prices, did not mean that the Connecticut program was preempted. Allco, 861 F.3d at 101 (“This incidental effect on wholesale prices does not, ... amount to a regulation of the interstate wholesale electricity market that infringes on FERC’s jurisdiction.”).22 *578H&e, too, any effects exerted by ZECs on the market auctions are indirect and incidental; those effects do not cause-the sort of “clear - damage to federal .goals,” Nw. Cent. 489 U.S. at 522, 109 S.Ct. 1262, that would give rise to a claim of conflict preemption, See Nazarian, 753 F.3d at 479-80 (“Obviously, not every state regulation that incidentally affects federal markets is preempted. Such an- outcome ‘would- .thoroughly undermine precisely the division of the regulatory field that Congress went to so much trouble to establish ..., and would render Congress’ specific grant of power to the States to regulate production virtually meaningless.’ ” (quoting Nw. Cent. Pipeline, 489 U.S. at 515, 109 S.Ct. 1262)). As discussed .supra, other forms of state incentives give the incentive-recipient this same sort of leg up in .the market.. If those incentives, including. RECs, are not conflict preempted — and Plaintiffs do not argue that they are — then the Court fails to see how ZECs are.
Plaintiffs argue that the issue of conflict preemption is not appropriately decided on a motion to dismiss, pointing out that other district courts decided the conflict preemption question- after considering factual and expert' evidence in the case. See PPL EnergyPlus, LLC v. Nazarian (hereafter, “Nazarian II”), 974 F.Supp.2d 790 (D. Md. 2013); PPL EnergyPlus, LLC v. Hanna, 977 F.Supp.2d 372 (D.N.J. 2013). Nazarian II and Hanna, however, presented plausible claims of conflict preemption. In those cases, the programs guaranteed a fixed price that displaced the wholesale auction price; that displacement resulted in clear damage to FERC’s goal of setting wholesale prices at auction. See Mem. and Order re: Mot. to Dismiss at 11, EOF 71, Nazarian II, No. MJG-12-1286 (D. Md. Aug. 3, 2012) (Plaintiffs asserted a plausible claim of conflict preemption based on their allegation that the generator benefit-ting from the Maryland program was “guaranteed receipt of the PSC fixed price” through a contract for difference and was therefore “not appropriately market-based.”); 23 see also Mem. and Order at 9, ECF 69, PPL Energy Plus, LLC v. Solomon (“Hanna""), No. 11-745 (D.N.J. Oct. 19, 2011) (Conflict preemption claim survived the motion to dismiss because the New Jersey program, which “impermissi-bly guarantee[d] a wholesale capacity price,” thereby “impede[d] FERC’s policy of establishing-a market-based approach to setting wholesale energy rates in the mid-Atlantic market.” (citing allegations' that New Jersey’s utilities are required to procure power at a fixed price approved by the State)). Put differently, the Naza/rian II and Hanna' programs stood-as an obstacle to FERC’s policy of using market principles to set wholesale prices because those programs guaranteed a predetermined, state-approved price, rather than the market auction price, for the wholesale sale' of energy or capacity.
*579No such • obstacle exists for the ZEC program. Unlike Nazarian II and Hanna, the ZEC program does not guarantee a certain wholesale price that displaces the market-determined price. Recognizing FERC’s goal to set wholesale prices through a market-based approach, the Court fails to see how the ZEC program causes clear damage to that goal. As discussed above, the nuclear generators receiving ZECs will receive for their energy whatever the market-clearing price is. Separately, they will be compensated for their ZECs, which are awarded based on the positive attributes of the energy they generate. Any price-distorting effects exerted by the ZECs on the market signals at the wholesale auctions are, at best, indirect and do not present the sort of “clear damage” required 'for a plausible conflict preemption claim. To hold otherwise would call into question RECs and all state subsidies, such as tax incentives and land grants; such subsidies, too, exert price-distorting effects on market signals and allow some generators to clear the auction when they otherwise would be priced out.
Plaintiffs cite International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987), to argue that state programs with the potential to undermine a federal regulatory structure are conflict preempted because States “cannot ‘do indirectly what they could not do directly.’ ” Opp. 32 (quoting Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 495, 107 S.Ct. 805). Ouellette is inapposite. In Ouellette, the Court considered whether a Vermont nuisance law was preempted by the Clean Water Act, which established a federal permit program regulating the discharge of pollutants and assigned different state regulatory roles based on whether the State was the source of the discharge. 479 U.S. at 489-91, 107 S.Ct. 805. Because application of the Vermont law could “effectively override the permit requirements and the policy choices made by the source State,” the Court concluded that the Vermont law effectively circumvented and upset the balance of interests contemplated by the Clean Water Act. Id. at 494-95, 107 S.Ct. 805. Accordingly, the Court held that the Vermont law was conflict preempted. Id. at 487, 493-97, 107 S.Ct. 805.
Nothing about the ZEC program “effectively override[s],” id. at 495, 107 S.Ct. 805, the FPA. ZECs do not circumvent the FERC auction — at the risk of being redundant, ZECs, like RECs, are payments for environmental attributes that are unbundled from' and involve separate transactions than those for the wholesale sales of energy or capacity. If the ZEC program were aimed at wholesale market participation or wholesale prices for sales of energy or capacity, then this would be a stronger case for conflict preemption. Unlike the Vermont law at issue in Ouellette, which did present a clear conflict between the state law and the federal regulatory scheme, the ZEC program does not “stand[ ] as an obstacle,” Oneok, 135 S.Ct. at 1595 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), to the FERC auction or the FPA.
Plaintiffs’ proposed discovery highlights the implausibility of their conflict preemption claim. The only two topics of discovery proposed by Plaintiffs relevant to the conflict preemption claim are: (1) fact discovery supporting Plaintiffs’ allegation that “the nuclear energy is not being sold directly to any customers at retail; it’s going into the auction process”; and (2) fact and expert discovery to demonstrate that the ZEC program ‘Will, in fact, have"" a substantial impact on the wholesale rate.” Status Conference Tr. 29:25-3,0:9-10, Dkt. 90 (Dee. 16, 2016), Again, even if all of the nuclear generators’ electricity is sold into the auction and the ZECs have an impact on the wholesale rate by affecting market signals, Plaintiffs will not have stated a *580plausible claim of conflict preemption. No factual discovery into these topics will surmount the core problem with Plaintiffs’ claim: the ZECs are not tethered to wholesale sales in a way that causes clear damage to federal goals.
Therefore, the Court concludes that the Complaint does not state a plausible claim of conflict preemption.24
III. DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE
The Commerce Clause empowers Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce .., among the several States.” U.S. Const, art. I, § 8, cl. 3. “The negative or dormant implication of the Commerce Clause prohibits state ... regulation ... that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby impedes free private trade in the national marketplace.” Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287, 117 S.Ct. 811, 136 L.Ed.2d 761 (1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). But “there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Kassel v. Consol. Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U.S. 662, 669, 101 S.Ct. 1309, 67 L.Ed.2d 580 (1981) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, a state law or regulation violates the dormant Commerce Clause “only if it (1) ‘clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce,’ (2) ‘imposes a burden on interstate commerce incommensurate with the local benefits secured,’ or (3) ‘has the practical effect of “extraterritorial” control of commerce occurring entirely outside the boundaries of the state in question.’ ” Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., 584 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Freedom Holdings Inc. v. Spitzer, 357 F.3d 205, 216 (2d Cir. 2004)).
Only the first two means of violating the dormant Commerce Clause are at issue here. Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program violates the dormant Commerce Clause because: (1) the ZEC program facially discriminates against out-of-state energy producers, including nuclear and other carbon-free energy producers, by selecting only New York nuclear power plants to receive ZECs, Compl. ¶ 98; and (2) the ZEC program imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce by distorting market pricing and incentives, which will cause energy generators, including out-of-state energy providers, to leave the market or discourage their entry into the market, Compl. ¶99. Plaintiffs have no cause of action under either theory and have, in any event, failed to allege a dormant Commerce Clause claim.
A. Cause of Action
Intervenors argue that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing to bring a dormant Commerce Clause claim because they do not allege a nexus between their *581injury and any discriminatory aspect of the ZEC program. Intervenors Mem. 22; In-tervenors Reply 15. In other words, Inter-venors argue that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing because Plaintiffs’ injury does not fall within the dormant Commerce Clause’s zone of interests. Courts. have consistently applied the zone of interests test to dormant Commerce Clause claims to determine whether plaintiffs have prudential standing. See, e.g., Boston Stock Exch. v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U.S. 318, 320 n.3, 97 S.Ct. 599, 50 L.Ed.2d 514 (1977); Selevan, 584 F.3d at 91-92; Cibolo Waste, Inc. v. City of San Antonio, 718 F.3d 469, 474-76 (5th Cir. 2013); Fla. Transp. Services, Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cty., 703 F.3d 1230, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 116, 187 L.Ed.2d 35 (2013); Yakima Valley Mem’l Hosp. v. Wash. State Dep’t of Health, 654 F.3d 919, 932-33 (9th Cir. 2011); Freeman v. Corzine, 629 F.3d 146, 156-57 (3d Cir. 2010); Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n v. Daviess Cty., 434 F.3d 898, 901-02 (6th Cir. 2006), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 550 U.S. 931, 127 S.Ct. 2294, 167 L.Ed.2d 1087 (2007).
The Supreme Court recently held that the zone of interests test does not fall under the prudential standing rubric; instead, whether a plaintiffs injury falls within a law’s zone of interests goes to whether the plaintiff has a cause of action. Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1377, 1387, 188 L.Ed.2d 392 (2014). The Supreme Court in Lexmark addressed the zone of interests inquiry only as it applies to statutory claims; it did not address constitutional claims, such • as Plaintiffs’ dormant Commerce Clause claim. Id. To the Court’s knowledge, only the Third Circuit has addressed whether Lexmark applies to constitutional claims. In • Maher Terminals, the Third Circuit applied the zone of interests test to determine whether the plaintiff had stated a Tonnage Clause25 claim, while clarifying that post-Lexmark this was not a prudential standing issue.26 Maher Terminals, LLC v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 805 F.3d 98, 105, 110 (3d Cir. 2015). This Court sees no reason not to apply Lexmark to constitutional claims. Just as “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet,”27 so, too, does the zone of interests test apply whether labeled a prudential standing issue or a cause of action issue. The Supreme Court’s reasoning that the zone of interests test is more logically a cause of action question applies equally to statutory and constitutional claims, and Lexmark did not reject the zone of interests test — it merely reclassified it. Accordingly, and in light of the numerous cases that have applied the zone of interests test to dormant Commerce Clause claims, the Court applies the zone of interests test to determine whether Plaintiffs have alleged a cause of action.28
*582The zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce Clause is the economic interests of out-of-state entities. Allocco Recycling, Ltd. v. Doherty, 378 F.Supp.2d 348, 358 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); see also Yakima Valley Mem’l Hosp., 654 F.3d at 932 (“Any alleged injury ‘must somehow be tied to a barrier imposed on interstate commerce.’ ” (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Cty. of Kern, 581 F.3d 841, 848 (9th Cir. 2009))). In other words, Plaintiffs must “allege an injury stemming from the application of the [ZEC program] in a manner discriminatory to out-of-state interests,” L.A.M. Recovery, Inc. v. Dep’t of Consumer Affairs, 184 Fed.Appx. 86, 88-89 (2d Cir. 2006) (summary order) (citing Boston Stock Exch., 429 U.S. at 321, 97 S.Ct. 599), whether due to facial discrimination against or an undue burden on out-of-state economic interests.
Plaintiffs entirely fail to allege any injury arising from discrimination against or an undue burden on out-of-state economic interests. As to their claim that the ZEC program facially discriminates against out-of-state nuclear power providers by awarding ZECs only to New York nuclear power plants, Plaintiffs do not allege that they own or represent an out-of-state nuclear power plant.29 In addition, Plaintiffs allege that the ZEC program is “directly- discriminatory” because it “is not even-handed with respect to other technologies that could produce carbon-free electricity,” Compl. ¶ 98, and that various Plaintiffs own or have members that own in- and out-of-state power suppliers (without specifying whether the power suppliers are nuclear), Compl. ¶¶ 10-15. That those Plaintiffs may be discriminated against because the ZEC program is available only to nuclear power plants — as opposed to other kinds of power plants that produce few or no greenhouse gas emissions — does not constitute a cause of action under the dormant Commerce Clause. That alleged injury does not fall within the zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce Clause — namely the protection of out-of-state economic interests. The dormant Commerce' Clause does not protect the economic interests of non-nuclear power plants, regardless of where they are located or whether they are carbon-free. See Nat’l Solid Waste Mgmt. Ass’n v. Pine Belt Reg’l Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 389 F.3d 491, 500 (5th Cir. 2004) (plaintiffs did not have prudential standing to bring dormant Commerce Clause claim on a facial discrimination theory because the plaintiffs’ injury was “not related to any out-of-state characteristic of their business”).
*583Plaintiffs also lack a cause of action to bring a dormant Commerce Clause claim on their undue burden theory. ■ According to that theory, Plaintiffs will be injured by the ZEC program because the otherwise unprofitable nuclear power plants receiving ZECs will drive down the auction prices received by all power plants, including Plaintiffs’ power plants, and will thus cause them to leave or discourage them from entering the market. Compl. ¶¶47, 74. But this alleged injury also falls outside the zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce. Clause. Under Plaintiffs’ theory, the same price-distorting effects and the same alleged injury would occur (probably to a more significant degree) if ZECs were extended to nuclear power plants nationwide.30 Thus, because Plaintiffs would be allegedly injured by the ZEC. program’s market distortion effect even if New York provided ZECs to in- and out-of-state nuclear power plants, Plaintiffs are not harmed because of an alleged undue burden on out-of-state economic interests.31
Although “the zone of interests test is not a rigorous one,” Nat’l Weather Serv. Employees Org., Branch 1-18 v. Brown, 18 F.3d 986, 989 (2d Cir. 1994), the interest sought to be protected must be at least arguably within the zone of interests to be protected by the dormant Commerce Clause, Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). Because Plaintiffs’ interests are, at best, “marginally related”- to the protection of out-of-state economic interests, Plaintiffs lack a cause of action.32 Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 760, 93 L.Ed.2d 757(1987).
B. Market Participant Exception and Subsidies
.Even if Plaintiffs had a cause of action, their dormant Commerce Clause claim would fail because New York was acting as a market participant, not as a regulator, when it created ZECs. The dormant Commerce Clause-“does not prohibit *584a state from participating in the free market if it acts like a private enterprise.” United Haulers Ass’n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 261 F.3d 246, 255 (2d Cir. 2001). “ ‘[A] state regulates when it exercises governmental powers that are unavailable to private parties,’ such as the imposition of civil or criminal penalties to compel behavior.” Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Pataki, 320 F.3d 200, 208 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting United Haulers Ass’n, Inc., 261 F.3d at 255). But, “[n]othing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.” Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 810, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976).
In Alexandria Scrap, in order to ameliorate the aesthetic and environmental problem associated with abandoned automobiles, Maryland created a bounty payable to any licensed processor that destroyed any vehicle formerly titled in Maryland. Id. at 797, 96 S.Ct. 2488. Maryland imposed a more burdensome title documentation requirement on out-of-state processors than in-state processors in order to receive the bounty. Id. at 801, 96 S.Ct. 2488. An out-of-state processor claimed that the Maryland law violated the dormant Commerce Clause because it gave Maryland processors an unfair advantage in the market for bounty-eligible hulks. Id. at 802, 96 S.Ct. 2488. The Supreme Court disagreed. It held that the Maryland law did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause because Maryland did not seek to prohibit the flow of hulks or regulate that flow but instead “entered into the market itself to bid up their price” for the legitimate purpose of protecting Maryland’s environment. Id. at 806, 809, 96 S.Ct. 2488. The Court acknowledged that the effect of the law was that Maryland hulks would be primarily destroyed by in-state processors and that in-state processors would primarily receive the bounties, but the Court held that “no trade barrier of the type forbidden by the Commerce Clause” restricted the movement of Maryland hulks out-of-state. Id. at 810, 96 S.Ct. 2488. Instead, the hulks remained in Maryland “in response to market forces, including that exerted by money from the State.” Id.
Building on Alexandria Scrap, in a case involving facts and allegations much closer to those at issue here, the District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissed the plaintiffs dormant Commerce Clause claim, reasoning that Connecticut was acting as a market participant when it created a market for RECs that subsidized clean energy generation. Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, Nos. 3:15-cv-608 (CSH), 3:16-cv-508 (CSH), 2016 WL 4414774, at *23-25 (D. Conn. Aug. 18, 2016), aff'd, 861 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2017). In Allco, the Plaintiff generated RECs in Georgia through one of its solar power facilities, but those RECs did not satisfy Connecticut’s requirements, which required that RECs be generated from power plants within the Northeast. Id. at *21. The district court concluded that, just as Maryland had incentivized market participants to destroy hulks by financially rewarding them to do so, Connecticut was merely making it “more lucrative for generators to produce and distribute clean energy in Connecticut” by creating a secondary REC market. Id. at *24. Connecticut is “not obligated to spread the benefit of that market to states that do not also bear the burden of the cost of the subsidy, which is ultimately paid by Connecticut ratepayers.” Id. The district court held that Connecticut was not acting as a regulator because it was “not preventing the flow of clean energy or regulating the con*585ditions on which it may occur.”33 Id.
This case follows in the footsteps of Alexandria Scrap and the district court’s decision in Allco. New York’s ZEC program does not create a trade barrier or prevent or regulate the flow of energy— renewable, nuclear, or otherwise. New York gives financially eligible nuclear generators that have historically contributed power into the New York market credit for the zero-emission attributes of each MWh of electricity they produce. Compl. ¶ 67. NYSERDA then buys the ZECs from the nuclear generators at an administratively determined price, and the cost is ultimately passed on to New York ratepayers. Compl. ¶¶ 69, 73. Just like Maryland in Alexandria Scrap and Connecticut in Allco, by distributing subsidies through the ZEC program to otherwise financially struggling nuclear power plants, New York is participating in the energy market and exercising its right to favor its own citizens.34 Moreover, just as Maryland and Connecticut were not required to subsidize out-of-state businesses when in-state residents were paying for the subsidies, neither is New York required to provide financial assistance in the form of ZECs to out-of-state power plants when the ZECs are ultimately paid for by New York ratepayers.
Plaintiffs argue that this ease is distinguishable because New York, and not the free market, sets the price of the ZECs and because ZECs are distributed on the basis of financial need, Opp. 40. Plaintiffs have not articulated why those distinctions are relevant to the dormant Commerce Clause analysis, and the Court does not find them to be relevant. New York is paying the nuclear power plants a set dollar amount for each MWh of electricity they produce in recognition of the zero-emission attributes of their electricity. This is no different than Maryland paying a set bounty to hulk processors. Whether the subsidy amount is at a government-set rate, as it is here and as it was in Alexandria Scrap, 426 U.S. at 797 n.5, 96 S.Ct. 2488, or set by market forces, as it was in Allco, 2016 WL 4414774, at *20, has no impact on the market participant analysis. Nor does the fact that ZECs are distributed based on financial need. The dormant Commerce Clause does not restrict which in-state businesses a State may subsidize when it is expending its own funds to do so, so long as the State does not also impose “taxes and regulatory measures impeding free private trade in the national *586marketplace,” Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U.S. 429, 436-37, 100 S.Ct. 2271, 65 L.Ed.2d 244 (1980).
Indeed, regardless of the market participant exception, although the Supreme Court has “never squarely confronted the constitutionality of subsidies,” Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 589, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997) (quotation marks and citation omitted), “[a] pure subsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no burden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business,” West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 199, 114 S.Ct. 2205, 129 L.Ed.2d 157 (1994); see also New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278, 108 S.Ct. 1803, 100 L.Ed.2d 302 (1988) (“Direct subsidization of domestic industry does not ordinarily run afoul of [the dormant Commerce Clause]... .”).35 The Supreme Court has, however, struck down a state subsidy; it did -so when a subsidy to in-state producers was coupled with a tax on in-state and out-of-state producers and thus functioned like a discriminatory tax on out-of-state producers. West Lynn Creamery, Inc., 512 U.S. at 214-15, 114 S.Ct. 2205. But the subsidy at issue here is not linked to a tax on out-of-state electricity generators — it is “a pure subsidy” for the environmental attributes of nuclear energy and"" is paid for by New York retail energy consumers. See C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 394, 114 S.Ct. 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 399 (1994) (noting' that instead of instituting an unconstitutional flow control ordinance to make a waste disposal facility commercially viable, the town could have subsidized the facility through general taxes or municipal bonds); see also United Haulers Ass’n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 550 U.S. 330, 368, 127 S.Ct. 1786, 167 L.Ed.2d 655 (2007) (same). Accordingly, the 'ZEC program is a permissible subsidy, and the market participant exception to the dormant Commerce Clause applies. For these additional reasons, the Complaint does not state a plausible dormant Commerce Clause claim.36

Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, — U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1288, 194 L.Ed.2d 414 (2016) is illustrative: ""For example, if four power plants bid to sell capacity at, respectively, $ 10/unit, $20/unit, $30/unit, and $40/unit, and the first three plants provide enough capacity to satisfy projected demand, [the auction administrator] will purchase capacity only from those three plants, each of which will receive $3 0/unit, the clearing price.” 136 S.Ct. at 1293.

. Amici New York Public Interest Research Group, Green Education and Legal Fund, Inc., Safe Energy Rights Group, Inc., and Promoting Health and Sustainable Energy, Inc. (collectively, “PIRG Amici”) argue that the generation of nuclear power is ""neither emissions free nor ‘zero-emissions,’ ” but instead emits radiation, waste heat, and greenhouse gases. Memorandum of Law of the Am-ici (“PIRG Amici Mem.”) 5-13, Dkt, 112-3. This may be true, but PIRG Amici do not go so far as to argue that the generation of nuclear power produces the same amount of noxious emissions as the generation of energy from fossil fuel or natural gas. At least with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, they assert that among the various ways to generate electricity, nuclear generation falls in the middle of the spectrum (wind producing the least and coal the most greenhouse gas emissions). PIRG Amici Mem. 8-9. The thrust of PIRG Amici's argument is that when creating the ZEC program, the PSC did not consider whether renewable energy sources could have *562replaced the nuclear generators or whether some nuclear power plants could be retired with no impact on electricity availability. PIRG Amici Mem. 8i 14 — 16; 18. the Court acknowledges that New York may have been able to adopt a more aggressive approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but nothing requires the States to make the perfect the enemy of the good.

.This year, only three nuclear generators in New York, Intervenors Robert Emmett Ginna plant’ (""Ginna”), James A. FitzPatrick plant (""FitzPatrick”), and Nine Mile Point plant, were deemed eligible for ZECs. CES Order at 128; see also• Compl. ¶ 58.

. The PSC noted that it established an admin- . istrative process to set ZEC prices, rather than allowing them to be set by the market, because there would not be a competitive market process to set ZEC prices. CES Order, App’x E at 4 (""[Tjhere are too few owners of the affected generation facilities for there to be a valid competitive process to determine the prices as the owners would have too much market power for effective competition.”).

. The Second Circuit's caveat relative to private parties who invoke federal jurisdiction ""to enforce the federal law themselves” as compared to seeking ""to preclude a municipal entity from subjecting them to local laws enacted in violation of federal requirements” is not entirely clear. It would seem that the Second Circuit is raising a standing issue because a private party who seeks to enforce the federal law but does not seek to preclude *565the application of a local law to itself would appear to lack standing. But the Second Circuit does not mention standing in its equity jurisdiction analysis, nor is it clear how the issue of standing vel non should be viewed when attempting to determine whether a cause of action exists in the first instance.
 ↵ 
. Independent of whether the FPA’s requirement that wholesale electricity rates be.just and reasonable is a judicially administrable standard, the parties dispute whether Plain■tiffs’ preemption claims require the Court to apply that standard. Plaintiffs argue that they seek only to ensure that the FERC-set rate continues to govern New York wholesale energy transactions and are not asking the Court to set rates. Opp. 16-17. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Plaintiffs’ preemption claims are rate-related requests for in-junctive relief that implicate the just and reasonable rate-setting standard. Defs. Reply 11. *566The Court agrees with Plaintiffs but does not base its holding on this argument.
 ↵ 
. Iri a nearly identical case in which electricity generators challenged a ZEC program as preempted by the FPA, the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois came to the opposite conclusion, namely that determining a.""just and reasonable” rate is, a judicially unadministrable standard. Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *9. For the reasons explained supra, this Court disagrees , with the Northern District of Illinois’s conclusion that ""just and reasonable” is judicially unadministrable, Moreover, unlike this Court, see supra note 10, that court thought that it would need to apply that standard and effectively get involved in rate-setting in order to resolve the plaintiffs’ preemption claim, The Northern District of Illinois concluded that because there was ""too much” distortion of the wholesale market, the court, would be required to address how much states could subsidize local industry that touched the wholesale energy market before the effect of those subsidies resulted in a rate that was not just and reasonable. Id. at *9.
 ↵ 
. The Court notes that the Northern District of Illinois also held that the Illinois ZEC program was neither field nor conflict preempted, for many of the same reasons discussed infra. Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *10-14 (granting motions to dismiss).

 ↵ 
. Although Oneok involved the Natural Gas Act (""NGA”) rather than the FPA, the Supreme Court ""has routinely relied on NGA cases in determining the scope of the FPA, and vice versa.” Hughes, 136 S.Ct. at 1298 n.10.
 ↵ 
. For that reason, Plaintiffs’. argument that Hugh'es would not have been decided differently if the Maryland program incorporated forecast prices rather than actual ones, Opp. 19, misses the mark. Plaintiffs do not cite, and the Court has not found, any language in Hughes indicating that the Supreme Court considered the pricing calculation for the subsidies to be constitutionally relevant. The •problem with Maryland's program was that the contract-for-difference guaranteed a price and conditioned that guaranteed price on the generator’s energy clearing .the auction. Although the auction-clearing price was considered in calculating the amount that would be received under the contract-for-difference (because the generator received the difference between the contract price and the clearing price), the use of the auction-clearing price as a metric was not constitutionally relevant; rather, the impermissible tether was relative to the generator's wholesale market participation. Id. at 1295, 1299. The Court finds no basis to conclude that consideration of wholesale prices (whether forecast or actual) in pricing a subsidy is material to the preemption analysis.
 ↵ 
. As a. policy matter, using the forecast wholesale prices in the ZEC price calculation is a rational policy decision: it creates a one-way ratchet pursuant to which the ZEC price can be adjusted only downwards, see Compl. ¶ 71, Tr. 40:11-13, which inures to the benefit of Plaintiffs and the ratepayers. In addition, and as noted by Intervenors, ""this is an odd argument for [Plaintiffs] to make, because it effectively concedes the legality of the first two years of the program where the price is fixed....""Tr. 46:19-21.

. To claim status as an exempt wholesale generator, the generator may file with FERC a notice of self-certification or a petition for a declaratory order requesting such status, which FERC then reviews. 18 ■ C.F.R. §§ 366.7(a)-(b). A generator with exempt wholesale generator status may notify FERC that it no longer, seeks to maintain its status if ""there is’ any material change in facts that may affect” that generator's status. § 366.7(c)(3). In addition, the generator’s status may be revoked if it fails to conform to the criteria required for such status. § 366.7(d).

.WSPP Inc. proposed two structures for the purchase and sale transactions of RECs; (1) RECs that were transferred independently (or unbundled) from energy and (2) RECs that were bundled with energy in the sale transaction. WSPP's only discussion of REC prices considered whether, in the context of RECs bundled with energy, to allocate the contract price between the RECs and energy or to impose a single price, subject to a cap, for both. WSPP ¶¶ 7, 15. WSPP, however, nowhere discussed how RECs themselves were to be priced, and WSPP did not address the price of RECs in transactions where, as here, the sales of RECs were unbundled from the sales of wholesale energy.

. ZECs are available only to energy producers that have historically contributed to clean energy resources in New York, produce zero-emissions electricity, and satisfy other standards. Compl. ¶¶ 67-68; CES Order at 124.
 ↵ 
. Plaintiffs assert that ""[u]nlike New York’s REC program, which is not tethered to the wholesale markets (and which Plaintiffs do not challenge), the ZEC program directly affects wholesale rates.” Opp. 30. Plaintiffs’ distinction between ZECs and RECs hinges on their legal conclusion that ZECs, and not RECs, are ""tethered to the wholesale markets.” The Court rejects Plaintiffs’ purported “tether” for the reasons discussed supra.
 ↵ 
. The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ alleged economic harm is that other generators were awarded ZECs while they were not and that Plaintiffs must compete against the generators receiving ZECs. See Compl. ¶ 74. But that harm exists because Plaintiffs do not produce energy with the environmental attributes encouraged by the ZEC program. That is, Plaintiffs fail to qualify for the ZEC program because of their business decisions about how they generate electricity.
 ↵ 
. Although the Second Circuit did not explicitly discuss whether its discussion of the contracts' effects on wholesale prices was rel*578evant to the field or conflict preemption question, -the Second Circuit, cited Hughes throughout that discussion, which was a field preemption case, Nevertheless, Allco concluded, as a matter of law, that the kind of effect alleged by Allco was an ""incidental effect on wholesale prices.” Allco, 861 F.3d at 101. The Court finds no basis to find that an effect that is ""incidental"" when contemplating field preemption loses its ""incidental” nature when -contemplating conflict preemption.
 ↵ 
. Nazarian II concerned the Maryland program that was struck down in Hughes. The district court denied the motion to dismiss in Nazarian II but later concluded after a bench trial that the Maryland program was field preempted, a decision affirmed by the Fourth Circuit, PPL Energyplus, LLC v. Nazarian, 753 F.3d 467 (4th Cir. 2014), and the Supreme Court, Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, — U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1288, 194 L.Ed.2d 414 (2016).
 ↵ 
, It is difficult to fathom how the ZEC program could cause ""clear damage” to FERC goals inasmuch as FERC has taken no steps to oppose the ZEC program, despite having had several months to do so, and has approved REC programs, which have an identical impact on the market. See WSPP, 139 FERC P 61061, 2012 WL 1395532. The fact that FERC has convened a technical conference ""to understand the potential for sustainable wholesale market designs that both preserve the benefits of regional markets and respect state policies” that encourage particular resource attributes would seem to indicate that FERC concurs with the Court’s conclusion that there is not a conflict between federal goals regarding wholesale market auctions and state policies that incentivize the production of energy with positive environmental attributes. See Notice of Technical Conference at 2, Dkt. 121-1 (FERC Mar. 3, 2017).

. The District Court for the Northern District of California has also'addressed whether Lexmark applies to constitutional claims. In HomeAway Inc. v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, the district court held that Lexmark did not address the prudential doctrine of third-party standing as applied to constitutional claims and declined to extend Lexmark as invalidating that strand of prudential standing doctrine. No. 14-CV-04859-JCS, 2015 WL 367121, at *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 27, 2015). Because third-party interests are not at issue here, the decision in HomeAway is not relevant.

 ↵ 
. In their opposition brief, Plaintiffs did not address Intervenors’ argument that Plaintiffs’ *582dormant Commerce Clause claim should be dismissed because Plaintiffs lack prudential standing, although Plaintiffs did attempt to address the issue in response to the Court's question during oral argument, see Tr. 35:4-39:15. ‘‘[F]ailure to adequately brief an argument constitutes waiver of that argument at [the] motion to dismiss stage.” Guzman v. Macy’s Retail Holdings, Inc., No. 09 CIV. 4472 (PGG), 2010 WL 1222044, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Nevertheless, the Court will consider the merits of the prudential standing issue, albeit reframed as a cause of action issue.
 ↵ 
. At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs represented to the Court that Plaintiff Electric Power Supply Association includes at least one member that is an out-of-state nuclear power plant. Tr. 35:17-25, But, ""[o]n a motion to dismiss, the Court must only examine the allegations in the complaint to determine whether Plaintiff has met the [zone of interests test],” Allocco Recycling, Ltd., 378 F.Supp.2d at 357 (citing Nash v. Califano, 613 F.2d 10, 14 (2d Cir. 1980)). Because the Court holds that even if Plaintiffs had a cause of action, their dormant Commerce Clause claims would fail, it would be futile for Plaintiffs to amend their Complaint to include allegations that they own or represent out-of-state nuclear facilities.
 ↵ 
. The District Court ""for the Northern District of Illinois made a similar point with respect to a dormant Commerce Clause challenge in Vill. of Old Mill Creek, 2017 WL 3008289, at *7, but did so in the context of holding the complaining plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to challenge Illinois’ ZEC program. That district court wrote: ""If the procurement process were non-discriminatory, the out-of-state, non-nuclear plaintiffs would still be injured, Similarly, the general market-distorting effects on non-nuclear plants outside of Illinois would still be felt if the ZEC procurement process subsidized nuclear -plants without favoring in-state interests.” Id,
 ↵ 
. In evaluating whether the plaintiffs had a cause of action under the Copyright Act, the Supreme Court in Lexmark analyzed the zone of interests and proximate cause requirements separately. 134 S.Ct. at 1388-91. The proximate cause analysis is similar to the zone of interests analysis and concerns ""whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits,” Id. at 1390. In other words, “the proximate-cause requirement generally bars suits for alleged harm that is 'too remote’ from the defendant’s unlawful conduct.” Id. For the same reasons that Plaintiffs’ undue burden claim is not within the dormant Commerce Clause’s zone of interests, it also fails to satisfy the proximate cause requirement.
 ↵ 
.Moreover, the Supreme Court has suggested that a less -generous approach may be appropriate outside of the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA”) context. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 134 S.Ct. at 1389 (""[T]he breadth of the zone of interests varies according to the provisions of law at issue, so that what comes within the zone of interests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review of administrative action under the ‘generous review provisions’ of the APA may not do so for other purposes,” (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997))).
 ↵ 
. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s dormant Commerce Clause ruling on a different ground without commenting on the district court's analytical approach. The Second Circuit applied General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 117 S.Ct. 811, 136 L.Ed.2d 761 (1997), to conclude that the Connecticut REC program did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause because a REC that satisfies Connecticut’s REC program can be produced only in the Northeast and is thus a different product that does not compete against a REC produced in Georgia. Allco, 861 F.3d at 103-08. The district court’s analytical approach is more applicable here than the Second Circuit’s approach given that the dormant Commerce Clause claim is not that New York is discriminating against a competing product from out-of-state but that New York (1) is not giving ZECs to out-of-state energy producers, and (2) is creating an undue burden on interstate commerce because ZECs distort market pricing and incentives.
 ↵ 
. New York is favoring its own citizens in the ZEC program as it is currently applied because only three power plants currently receive ZECs, and they are all in New York. The parties dispute whether the ZEC program, by requiring nuclear power plants to have been historical providers of energy to New York, effectively limits eligibility to New York nuclear power plants. Compare Defs. Mem. 23, and Intervenors Mem, 23, and Defs. Reply 13-14, with Opp. 37.
 ↵ 
. Courts often apply the market participant exception to dormant Commerce Clause cases concerning subsidies, but because some cases have analyzed whether subsidies violate the dormant Commerce Clause independent of— and without mention of — the market participant exception, this Court also addresses whether ZECs are a permissible subsidy pursuant to those cases, independent of the market participant exception doctrine.
 ↵ 
. Because Plaintiffs lack a cause of action, the market participant exception applies, and the ZEC program is a permissible subsidy, the Court need not reach the parties' arguments regarding whether the ZEC program is facially discriminatory or poses an undue burden. Nevertheless, the Court is skeptical that the ZEC program poses a disparate, undue burden on out-of-state economic interests on the theory, as alleged by Plaintiffs, that ZECs artificially reduce market prices. That alleged harm is not disparate — it affects in-state and out-of-state power plants equally.

Opinion
HUFFMAN, J. 
Plaintiffs and appellants Borrego Water District et al. (Borrego), a group of public entities and retail purchasers of electricity, filed this action for damages and other relief against defendants and respondents AES Corporation et al. (AES), a number of companies and their subsidiaries which are generators, sellers, or traders of electricity at wholesale (defendants). In their master complaint filed in 2002 in these coordinated actions, plaintiffs allege violations of California’s antitrust laws (Bus. & Prof. Code, 1 § 16720; hereafter the Cartwright Act), as well as violations of California’s unfair competition law (§ 17200 et seq.; hereafter the UCL). 2 These allegations all arise out of market conditions and events during the California energy crisis of 2000 and onward, relating to claims for damages and injunctive relief for anticompetitive activity and/or unfair competition in the wholesale electricity market.
In response to the filing of this action, and after a delay of several years due to removal to federal court and remand to state court, all defendants brought and renewed a joint demurrer to the master complaint, on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. Defendants argued the subject matter of the master complaint was preempted by federal law that had occupied the field of wholesale electricity market control and regulation, because plaintiffs’ theories of recovery would inevitably require the superior court to determine reasonable rates for wholesale power sales. Defendants further argued that a regulatory doctrine, the filed rate doctrine, barred the filing of this action for damages. (See Public Utility v. Dynegy Power Marketing (9th Cir. 2004) 384 F.3d 756 (Snohomish); Public Utility, Grays Harbor, WA v. IDACORP (9th Cir. 2004) 379 F.3d 641, 647 (Grays Harbor).) The trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
Plaintiffs appeal, contending the ruling was erroneous because California case law, Younger v. Jensen (1980) 26 Cal.3d 397 [161 Cal.Rptr. 905, 605 P.2d 813] (Younger) and Spielholz v. Superior Court (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1366 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 197] (Spielholz), should support a finding that state law can provide an independent ground for regulation of the anticompetitive or unfair *1299 conduct of defendants, through an award of antitrust damages, such that there should be no finding of federal preemption. Plaintiffs found further support for their theory of general applicability of state antitrust laws in the context of electricity market disputes in the United States Supreme Court case of Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States (1973) 410 U.S. 366 [35 L.Ed.2d 359, 93 S.Ct. 1022] (Otter Tail Power).
Our analysis of the master complaint and pertinent case law convinces us that the trial court correctly applied the doctrines of field and conflict preemption in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. We find additional support for that conclusion in the filed rate doctrine, relied on by the trial court as an alternate ground for its ruling on demurrer. (California ex rel. Lockyer v. Dynegy, Inc. (9th Cir. 2004) 375 F.3d 831, 852-853 (Dynegy).) We affirm the judgment of dismissal.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
A
Master Complaint; Coordinated Proceedings
Since 2001, these coordinated proceedings have included a total of six actions originating both in San Diego and in other counties. Plaintiffs, the People of the State of California (suing through city attorneys) and 21 retail purchasers of electricity, filed their master complaint in 2002. These plaintiffs did not purchase power directly from defendants, which are wholesalers, but rather from several investor-owned utilities, including San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. Although several of the plaintiffs originally sought class certification, those matters were apparently stayed pending the demurrer proceedings and are not before us on this appeal. 3
A number of major named defendant groups have settled this case and are not participants in this appeal (Reliant Energy, Duke Energy, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading, and Mirant Americas Energy, etc.). 4 The remaining defendants, and their subsidiaries for whose activities they are sued, are four *1300 groups of generators, sellers, or traders of electricity at wholesale (Dynegy, Inc.; Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.; AES Corporation; and Sempra Energy, Inc.). 5
Plaintiffs assert a number of alleged violations of the Cartwright Act (first cause of action) and the unfair and/or unlawful prongs of the UCL statute (second and third causes of action), occurring around 2000, during a period of intense governmental and commercial activity to deregulate the electricity markets pursuant to 1996 state legislation, Public Utilities Code section 330 et seq. (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 835 [“Noting the energy industry restructuring already underway, the California Legislature decided that reshaping the market for California energy could help provide competitive, lower cost and reliable electricity service, while preserving the state’s commitment to developing diverse, environmentally sensitive electricity resources. [Citation.] Assembly Bill 1890 (‘AB 1890’) established the legal structure for the deregulation and restructuring plan”].)
In the introductory allegations of the master complaint, plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to recover damages and other equitable and injunctive relief, based on injuries incurred during this period and “arising from defendants’ manipulation, distortion, and corruption of California’s deregulated wholesale electricity market. Defendants’ unfair and unlawful business practices and illegal restraints of trade included combining to withhold supply from electricity markets and colluding to fix electricity prices. This conduct forced electricity users to pay electricity prices based not on competitive market forces, but prices which were grossly inflated due to defendants’ conduct. [][] This action seeks to remedy that conduct, which caused widespread electricity shortages and astronomical prices. Defendants’ manipulation of what was supposed to be a competitive market for wholesale electricity harmed all Californians and destabilized the California economy, which depends on a reliable supply of competitively priced energy. The total harm caused by defendants’ conduct is, at this point, unknown. . . .”
Plaintiffs’ master complaint cites to several examples of defendants’ alleged exploitation of the changes since 1996 in the energy market’s new regulatory and economic structure. These include practices of “conspiring to withhold the supply of energy into the PX and ISO [power exchange and Independent System Operator, nonprofit public benefit corporations established by the Legislature] markets and to manipulate the price at which *1301 wholesale energy was sold.” Plaintiffs allege this constituted “gaming the market” to create false shortages and prevent the sale of electricity at competitive rates. 6
The master complaint describes how the ISO was charged with balancing the supply of energy offered for sale into the market with demand at certain points in time, and was required to purchase energy on the spot market to meet any shortfalls. This spot market was susceptible to manipulation regarding the price of wholesale energy, which was set by the “market clearing price,” or the highest price offered for sale of energy necessary to meet the load. This scheme was supposed to promote competition to attract new sources of power and lower the price of electricity, but according to plaintiffs, it was subject to abuse.
Additionally, defendants’ communications and information sharing were alleged to be made for the purpose of and having the effect of manipulating supply and fixing prices. Defendants “manipulated supply such that the ISO was forced to issue shortage warnings during the Summer of 2000 even though the State had sufficient generating capacity. Defendants accomplished this by withholding supply from the PX and ISO markets, thus creating artificial shortages of electricity which, in turn, raised the market clearing prices on the wholesale energy markets. Much of this withholding was executed by simply shutting down or restricting the output of operational electricity generators. . . . [][] This sort of activity provided the pretext— electricity shortages—for defendants’ collusive and outrageous sales prices offered into the wholesale energy markets operated by the PX and ISO. From their respective trading floors, defendants coordinated the prices for electricity they offered for sale, otherwise known as ‘bid rigging.’ ”
Plaintiffs therefore alleged that defendants’ conduct departed from a competitive model, and they could “wield ‘market power,’ i.e., the ability to control the market price.” This conduct “materially raised electricity prices in the PX and ISO markets, which in turn, resulted in higher retail prices to consumers.” The relief sought included actual and treble damages, restitution, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.
B
Demurrer/Opposition
In June 2005, after remand from federal court, defendants renewed their joint demurrer, asserting a lack of jurisdiction in the superior court, based on *1302 federal preemption, as well as failure to state the causes of action. Defendants asserted plaintiffs’ claims, based on conduct occurring in the wholesale energy market, cannot be adjudicated in state court because that is a field which is regulated by the federal government through the Federal Power Act (FPA; 16 U.S.C. § 791a et seq.) and placed within the exclusive authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Defendants relied on federal case law holding that state law claims arising from wholesale transactions in the interstate electricity market are preempted under the FPA and that the filed rate doctrine applies to rates regulated under the FPA. (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756; Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 647.)
Defendant argued the cases cited by plaintiffs as precluding a finding of preemption, such as Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, and Spielholz, supra, 86 Cal.App.4th 1366, were distinguishable and more limited than plaintiffs believed. Opposition and reply papers were filed, supported by extensive judicially noticeable material from FERC records. 7
At oral argument in the trial court, defendants responded to plaintiffs’ theories with the observation that there were ongoing refund requests before FERC by one of the defendants’ subsidiaries, San Diego Gas & Electric, and defendants contended FERC was the proper forum. Plaintiffs continued to argue that in light of the various changes in the FERC regulatory process, from filed rates to a market-based type of regulation, Congress could not have intended to preempt the field when it enacted the FPA. Plaintiffs relied on Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, to contend concurrent state antitrust regulation in the wholesale market was appropriate, also citing to a related case in which a federal district court judge had observed that it was possible to establish a violation of the Cartwright Act without reference to the FPA’s “ ‘just and reasonable’ ” rates standard. (Hendricks v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. (S.D.Cal 2001) 160 F.Supp.2d 1155, 1163 (Hendricks).) In plaintiffs’ view, it was possible to establish damages for anticompetitive conduct by defendants that were not measured by rate regulation standards. Plaintiffs contended that antitrust damages should be measured by what price the market would have set if anticompetitive forces were not operating, as distinguished from the *1303 FERC standard of a just and reasonable rate, which was tied to how much money defendants were entitled to be making. The matter was taken under submission.
C
Ruling
After oral argument, the trial court issued its order, setting forth its reasoning as follows. First, the court granted the respective requests for judicial notice of rulings and orders issued by FERC. The demurrer was sustained on the basis that all claims were preempted and Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, was distinguishable. The court primarily relied on the authority of a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, to conclude that plaintiffs’ claims and prayer for relief would impermissibly require a “fair price” determination, already found to be barred by preemption principles in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641. The court concluded the field preemption and conflict preemption principles barred each of plaintiffs’ claims.
Further, the trial court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366, would bar a finding of preemption, “because that case concerned federal antitrust laws and not state antitrust laws as Plaintiffs allege in their Master Complaint.” The court further noted that in light of its finding that preemption bars plaintiffs’ claims, it was not required to reach the issue of the applicability of the filed rate doctrine; nevertheless, those principles would bar these claims (relying on, e.g., Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756; Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831). These rulings were dispositive and the master complaint was dismissed.
Plaintiffs, through liaison counsel, timely filed their notice of appeal.
DISCUSSION
The main thrust of the complaint is that defendants’ conduct, their alleged “manipulation, distortion and corruption” of the wholesale electricity market in California, “forced electricity users to pay electricity prices based not on competitive market forces, but prices which were grossly inflated due to defendants’ conduct,” thereby giving rise to an entitlement to antitrust damages and unfair competition remedies in favor of plaintiffs. To avoid the effect of federal preemption in this heavily regulated area, plaintiffs seek to distinguish between the regulatory authority granted to FERC to order compliance with its policies, such as by ordering refunds to electricity *1304 consumers, and the types of damages and other relief recoverable under the Cartwright Act and/or the UCL.
We first set forth rules regarding federal preemption in this factual and legal context. We then address the filed rate doctrine.
I
QUESTIONS OF LAW PRESENTED
To address these issues as resolved on demurrer, we apply basic standards of review. “We review the trial court’s sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend de novo, exercising our independent judgment as to whether a cause of action has been stated as a matter of law. [Citations.] We ‘give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] A judgment based on a dismissal must be affirmed if any of the grounds for demurrer raised by the defendant is well-taken and disposes of the complaint. [Citation.]” (Gallivan v. AT&T Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1381 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 898].)
“When the issues regarding federal preemption involve undisputed facts, it is a question of law whether a federal statute or regulation preempts a state law claim and, on appeal, we independently review a trial court’s determination on that issue of preemption. [Citations.]” (Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1476 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 653] (Smith).)
A preliminary question of law we must address is whether plaintiffs are entitled to claim the benefit of “the general rule disfavoring implied preemption.” (Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. Public Utilities Com. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1303, 1311-1312 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 435] (Southern California Edison).) This is sometimes termed a “presumption against preemption. ‘We apply a presumption against federal preemption unless the state attempts to regulate an area in which there is a history of significant federal regulation.’ [Citation.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 648, fn. 7.) Plaintiffs rely on Smith, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, to argue that the Cartwright Act may provide alternative schemes of regulation of wholesale electricity markets, to the extent that such claims are not inconsistent with federal preemption in this area. They hinge this claim upon their perception that antitrust damages arising from defendants’ anticompetitive conduct are different in nature from any penalties or refunds that FERC might order resulting from the same type of conduct. They argue the party claiming federal preemption (defendants) have the burden to show specific state law claims are preempted. (Smith, supra, at p. 1475.)
*1305 In response, defendants cite to Southern California Edison, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th 1303, to say that the “presumption against preemption” is “characteristically applied where the field is one that the states have traditionally occupied and regulated. [Citation.] The presumption ‘is not triggered when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] Inasmuch as the field of interconnection [wholesale electricity distribution] agreements has a history of significant federal presence, the presumption against preemption is not applicable here.” (Id. at pp. 1311-1312.) We agree with those observations and those of the court in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 648, footnote 7, that “[t]his presumption is almost certainly not applicable here because the federal government has long regulated wholesale electricity rates.”
We therefore seek to examine, free from any such presumption against preemption, the respective merits of the arguments by both plaintiffs and defendants regarding the application of preemption principles here.
n
PREEMPTION PRINCIPLES
As set forth in Smith, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1476, our task is to examine “the precise language of the federal law or regulation to determine whether a particular state law claim is preempted. [Citations.] ‘As to each state law claim, the central inquiry is whether file legal duty that is the predicate of the [claim] constitutes a requirement or prohibition of the sort that federal law expressly preempts. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)
To carry out this analysis of the scope of preemption in the energy/electricity context, we first outline the leading case authority dealing with similar claims arising out of the California energy crisis in the wholesale electricity market, as issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We then compare the nature of the antitrust/UCL damages requested, to the remedial powers allocated by the FPA (16 U.S.C. § 791a) to FERC (formerly the FPC (Federal Power Commission) [see hist. & stat. notes, 16 U.S.C.A. (2000) foll. § 792, p. 78]). We note that although preemption principles are closely intertwined with the “filed rate doctrine,” which is central to FERC’s operations, we may nevertheless discuss them separately. (California ex rel. Lockyer v. F.E.R.C. (9th Cir. 2004) 383 F.3d 1006, 1011 (Lockyer).) The reason is that the historic filed rate doctrine is undergoing fast-paced evolution in the context of energy deregulation, such as the aftermath of the 1996 California legislation with which we are dealing. (Pub. Util. Code, § 330 et seq.; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 852-853.) We will address this evolution to the extent necessary in part III, post.
*1306 Finally, with this background set forth, we will analyze plaintiffs’ arguments that certain alternative federal and state authority shows that antitrust relief in the state courts is not inconsistent with the grant of federal authority to regulate the wholesale electricity market. (E.g., Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397; Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366.)
A
Recent Ninth Circuit Authority
In Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 644, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals built upon earlier authority (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831), to address “contract-related claims against energy wholesalers by a public utility which contends it was forced to pay exorbitant prices for electricity.” (Grays Harbor, supra, at p. 644.) The court upheld a district court dismissal of such contract claims on preemption grounds. It first set forth basic preemption principles: “As an initial matter, it is clear that the Federal Power Act (the ‘FPA’) grants FERC ‘ “exclusive authority to regulate the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce.” ’ [Citations.] Through the FPA, ‘ “Congress meant to draw a bright line easily ascertained, between state and federal jurisdiction. . . . This was done in the Power Act by making [FERC] jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which Congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the States.” ’ [Citation.] This power includes the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates. [Citations.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 646-647.)
In Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 839, the court explained the operation of the ISO tariffs filed with FERC, and said that “the ISO tariff binds the companies to important obligations and duties that are relevant and necessary to the state law claim.” (Ibid.) For example, “the ISO must file schedules showing its rates and charges, and the practices and regulations affecting such charges. [Citation.] The filing enables FERC to determine whether the ISO rules and regulations pertaining to those charges are reasonable, as required by the FPA. [Citation.] Once filed with a federal agency, such tariffs are the ‘equivalent of a federal regulation.’ [Citations.] . . . Besides specifying the generators’ responsibilities, the tariff also details penalties and remedies for non-compliance.” (Ibid.)
Even though the unsuccessful plaintiff in Grays Harbor was claiming contract damages (nominally state law causes of action), the court of appeals read its complaint as seeming, impermissibly, “to require the district court, at some point, to determine the fair price of the electricity that was delivered under the contract. This determination is clearly within FERC’s jurisdiction *1307 for determining the reasonableness of wholesale rates. [Citations.] At the very least, the requested relief intrudes on an ‘identifiable portion’ of a field that the federal government has occupied and addresses a matter that is ‘in any way regulated by the federal government.’ [Citation.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d at p. 648.)
The court of appeals also rejected the plaintiff’s claim that “market-based rates are not within FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction over wholesale rates.” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 649.) The federal court acknowledged that FERC had changed its policies from requiring filed rates to allowing market-based rates. However, traditional preemption principles continue to apply because, “by asking the court to set a fair price, Grays Harbor is invoking a state rule (specifically, contract law) that would interfere with the method by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goals (specifically, FERC regulation of wholesale electricity rates). To permit Grays Harbor to receive in its court action what is essentially a refund would create a conflict with FERC’s authority over wholesale rates. And such a result would make state law stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress under the FPA.” (Id. at p. 650, fn. omitted.) The court ruled the contract claims would interfere with FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction to set wholesale rates and were barred by field preemption, conflict preemption, and the filed rate doctrine. (Id. at pp. 648, 650, 651.)
In the next case, Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, the court extended the reasoning in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, from the contract field to the antitrust field. The federal court found that preemption rules applied to preclude a California state law antitrust court action that was essentially challenging market-based rates. The court explained its reasoning: “The fundamental question in this case is whether, under the market-based system of setting wholesale electricity rates, FERC is doing enough regulation to justify federal preemption of state laws. The answer to this question is controlled by two recent decisions of this court: Dynegy, [supra,] 375 F.3d 831, and Grays Harbor, [supra,] 379 F.3d 641. Under the system at issue here, FERC has waived many of the requirements that applied under the cost-based system. For example, the actual prices are no longer filed with FERC 60 days before they can be charged and the utilities do not provide FERC with detailed schedules of their costs. Instead, the price of wholesale electricity is determined in the markets operated by the PX and the ISO. [f] FERC continued to oversee wholesale electricity rates, however, by reviewing and approving a variety of documents filed by the defendants, the PX, and the ISO.” (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, 760, italics added.)
*1308 The federal court of appeals then gave several examples of how FERC was continuing to exercise its regulatory power to a sufficient degree to justify continued federal preemption. These included considering applications for approval of market-based tariffs upon a showing that the seller lacked or had mitigated its market power; requiring power sellers to file quarterly reports, which contained certain required information including the minimum and maximum rate charged and the total amount of power delivered during the quarter; and reviewing “detailed tariffs filed by the PX and the ISO, which described in detail how the markets operated by each entity would function.” (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, 761.)
Next, the court in Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, described how FERC had taken action to order wholesalers to disgorge profits that resulted from the anticompetitive practices involved in that particular case. From all of these factors, the federal court decided that preemption-related doctrines would continue to apply when market-based rates are involved, as laid out in Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641. (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d at pp. 760-761.) Even though Grays Harbor was a contract case, the same reasoning applied to the claims by Snohomish, alleging violations of state antitrust and unfair competition law. The court concluded that both types of claims sought to have the district court “determine the rates that ‘would have been achieved in a competitive market.’ This is the same determination as the ‘fair price’ determination that we held was barred by preemption principles in Grays Harbor. We therefore hold that Snohomish’s claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine, by field preemption, and by conflict preemption.” (Snohomish, supra, at p. 761.) The plaintiff’s proper course of action was to apply to FERC to redress its claims that the prices in the wholesale electricity markets were not just and reasonable or that the defendants sold electricity in violation of the filed tariffs. Snohomish’s state antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. (Id. at p. 762.)
B
Nature of Remedies: FERC Regulatory Scheme/Antitrust Damages
Notwithstanding the above authority, plaintiffs contend that they may continue to pursue their claims for relief, damages pursued under the Cartwright Act and the UCL (alleging unlawful or unfair conduct), as alternative theories of recovery. However, in their reply brief, plaintiffs appear to admit that injunctive relief is not available, although their position is unclear. In any case, in Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756, the court noted *1309 such injunctive relief has been held to be barred in this context by preemption principles, as well as the filed rate doctrine. (Id. at pp. 761-762; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d at pp. 849-853.) Ninth Circuit cases have held that injunctive relief under the UCL in this context of energy regulation is preempted, because it would “ ‘encroach[] upon the substantive provisions of the tariff, an area reserved exclusively to FERC, both to enforce and to seek remedy.’ ” (Snohomish, supra, at p. 762; see Dynegy, supra, at pp. 836, 852.)
We therefore focus upon plaintiffs’ remaining claims for antitrust damages for the defendants’ anticompetitive conduct. “[T]he central purpose of the antitrust laws, state and federal, is to preserve competition. It is competition—not the collusive fixing of prices at levels either low or high—that these statutes recognize as vital to the public interest.” (Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc. (9th Cir. 2000) 232 F.3d 979, 988 (Knevelbaard).)
Plaintiffs’ arguments require a comparison of antitrust relief to the remedies available from FERC under the FPA. One of the elements of standing to seek antitrust damages for anticompetitive conduct is a sufficient showing of injury with respect to: “ ‘(1) the nature of the plaintiff’s alleged injury; that is, whether it was the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall; (2) the directness of the injury; (3) the speculative measure of the harm; (4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and (5) the complexity in apportioning damages.’ ” (Knevelbaard, supra, 232 F.3d 979, 987.) A court must “ ‘evaluate the plaintiff’s harm, the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants, and the relationship between them.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.; see Kolling v. Dow Jones & Co. (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 709, 723 [187 Cal.Rptr. 797] [antitrust standing is required under the Cartwright Act].)
It is well accepted that damages awards in antitrust cases may not be based upon “sheer guesswork or speculation.” (Suburban Mobile Homes, Inc. v. AMFAC Communities, Inc. (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 532, 545 [161 Cal.Rptr. 811].) Rather, a plaintiff seeking such damages must establish to a reasonable probability that there was some causal connection between defendant’s wrongful act and the damages alleged, such as lost profits. (Ibid.) “Once that has been accomplished, the jury will be permitted to act upon probable and inferential proof and to ‘make a just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data, and render its verdict accordingly.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs say they can prove an entitlement to antitrust damages in state court, on the basis that the injuries they sustained as consumers from the *1310 anticompetitive acts of defendants are mainly unrelated to FERC’s normal duties of regulating rates and tariffs for the delivery of electricity on a wholesale basis. Plaintiffs believe they can show all the elements of “antitrust injury,” i.e., “ ‘(1) unlawful conduct, (2) causing an injury to the plaintiff, (3) that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful, and (4) that is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.’ ” (Knevelbaard, supra, 232 F.3d 979, 987.) Plaintiffs believe that the injury they allege is distinct from the high energy prices allegedly caused by defendants’ actions in creating collusive supply, demand, and price manipulation. They say their claims “are based on duties and obligations that arise entirely independently of any ‘tariff’ relevant to this case.” However, they admit that if FERC were to award any refunds, these would have to be offset against any court award of antitrust or UCL damages, and vice versa.
Defendants rely on the FPA statutory scheme as preempting the field, according to the basic principles explained in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1011, as follows: “The Federal Power Act governs the transmission and wholesale sales of electrical energy in interstate commerce. [Citation.] Pursuant to its authority under the FPA, FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over interstate wholesale power rates. [Citations.] The FPA requires that all rates for the transmission and sale of wholesale electricity be filed with FERC and published for public review. [Citation.] FERC is obligated to ensure that wholesale power rates are ‘just and reasonable,’ [citation], and applied in a non-discriminatory manner, [citations]. Indeed, FERC’s authority to determine whether wholesale rates are ‘just and reasonable’ is exclusive. [Citation.]” (Lockyer, supra, at p. 1011.) As explained in Dynegy, the wholesale producers’ filings will enable FERC “to determine whether the ISO rules and regulations pertaining to those charges are reasonable, as required by the FPA. [Citation.] Once filed with a federal agency, such tariffs are the ‘equivalent of a federal regulation.’ [Citations.]” (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d at p. 839.)
Defendants accordingly argue that the FPA preempts this field and requires that any such relief be requested from FERC, such as refunds to purchasers. They point to 16 United States Code section 824d(a) et seq., providing that FERC is charged with regulating and disclosing “just and reasonable rates” as follows: “All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.” (16 U.S.C. § 824d(a).) Likewise, in 16 United States Code section 824d(c), FERC is authorized to *1311 require public utilities to file and disclose “schedules showing all rates and charges for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such rates and charges, together with all contracts which in any manner affect or relate to such rates, charges, classifications, and services.”
FERC also has the power under 16 United States Code section 824e(a) to prohibit “[u]njust or preferential rates, etc.” and to order remedies as follows: “Whenever the Commission, after a hearing held upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affected such rate, charge, or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order.” In 16 United States Code section 824e(b), the commission is entitled to prescribe the effective dates of refunds that it orders. We believe the broad scope of these statutes must invoke the rule that antitrust damages will not be proper where there is a risk of duplicative recovery. The nature of plaintiffs’ alleged injury (equivalent to an entitlement to refunds) is apparently inseparable from the type of injury the antitrust laws were intended to forestall. (Knevelbaard, supra, 232 F.3d 979, 987.)
Plaintiffs, however, offer several reasons why these applications of preemption theory were wrongly decided or distinguishable from their claims, as we next discuss.
C
Alternative Approaches Relied on by Plaintiffs to Preclude a Preemption Finding
Plaintiffs rely on California law (Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397; Spielholz, supra, 86 Cal.App.4th 1366) to argue no federal preemption principles apply here. They also cite to Otter Tail Power, as representing the concept that activities coming under the jurisdiction of a regulatory agency “nevertheless may be subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws.” (Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366, 372.) Plaintiffs seemingly argue for a “back to basics” approach to preemption, based on this older case law focusing on congressional intent. Further, they point to language in the Lockyer opinion (Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006) as showing that the federal courts here recognized that FERC is not doing a good enough job, such that alternative remedies should *1312 now be allowed through this state antitrust action. We discuss these theories in turn.
In Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, the court explained that an agency such as the FPC (now FERC) must take antitrust considerations into account when it determines “ ‘public interest’ ” and “ ‘public convenience and necessity,’ ” but the agency “has ‘no power to insulate utilities under its regulation from the operation of the antitrust acts, or to determine when an antitrust violation has taken place. Otter Tail Power[, supra,) 410 U.S. 366, 93 S.Ct. 1022, 35 L.Ed.2d 359 . . . .’ [Citations.]” (Younger, supra, at pp. 407-408.) The Supreme Court decided that a parallel piece of legislation, the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. § 717 et seq.), did not preclude the state Attorney General from investigating possible violations of California antitrust law. It reasoned that the act did not expressly prohibit investigation or other activity regarding state antitrust laws, and that such practices could be consistent with the federal counterparts. (Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d at p. 408.) The Supreme Court therefore found no federal preemption of the state Attorney General’s investigation of alleged conduct such as “ ‘price fixing, monopolization, divisions of markets, and restraint of trade,’ ” and said “[hypothetical conflict between federal law and enforcement of California antitrust provisions within the scope of the investigation, even if assumed, is not ground for preemption since it may never arise in fact. [Citations.]” (Ibid.) Instead, state investigations into possible violations of California statutes that were in harmony with federal antitrust laws were deemed to be permissible and not preempted. (Id. at p. 409.)
Plaintiffs argue the authority of Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397, 409, is not restricted to authorizing state antitrust investigation procedures, but should also extend to authorizing state antitrust enforcement actions, such as this complaint. We disagree, because more than a “[hypothetical conflict between federal law and enforcement of California antitrust provisions” (id. at p. 408) is present here, in light of the extensive nature of the FERC regulatory scheme over the wholesale electricity market. In the FPA, we are presented with “ ‘ “a bright line easily ascertained, between state and federal jurisdiction. . . . This was done in the Power Act by making [FERC] jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which Congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the States.” ’ [Citations.] This power includes the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates. [Citations.]” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 646-647.) Plaintiffs cannot explain why the trial court would not have to second-guess FERC rate determinations in fixing antitrust damages to punish defendants for the alleged anticompetitive conduct, because such conduct would directly affect the reasonableness of the rates charged.
*1313 In the UCL context, in Spielholz, supra, 86 Cal.App.4th 1366, those plaintiffs were allowed to proceed with false advertising allegations that a telecommunications carrier had falsely advertised a “seamless calling area” existed, where in reality, there were gaps where wireless telephone users were unable to connect calls. The Court of Appeal found no federal preemption of such claims, because the main allegations dealt with false advertising, such that any effect on rates was merely incidental. Here, however, as stated by the trial court, “This can be contrasted to the instant case, involving the FPA, where Plaintiffs’ allegations concern conduct directly related to rates charged and ultimately paid.” We agree with the trial court’s analyses of the California case law claims, because plaintiffs have been unable to show why the alleged anticompetitive conduct by defendants inflicted any different kind of injury on them, that is separate from the rates charged and ultimately paid. This is not a case in which incidental damages are claimed to arise from conduct that is not covered by the federal legislation, such as false advertising.
In its ruling, the trial court also rejected the argument that Otter Tail Power would bar a finding of preemption, since that case concerned federal antitrust laws and not state antitrust laws. There, the Supreme Court relied on legislative history to find nothing in the FPA that would “insulate electric power companies from the operation of the antitrust laws.” (Otter Tail Power, supra, 410 U.S. 366, 374-375.) Rather, to the extent that voluntary business relationships are utilized to control the interstate distribution of power (as opposed to governmental regulation), “courts must be hesitant to conclude that Congress intended to override the fundamental national policies embodied in the antitrust laws.” (Ibid.) The court in Otter Tail Power held there is no basis to conclude that the limited power granted to the FPC/FERC to regulate certain aspects of electrical supply (e.g., ordering interconnections of power lines) “was intended to be a substitute for, or to immunize Otter Tail from, antitrust regulation for refusing to deal with municipal corporations.” (Ibid.) This authority is distinguishable because these plaintiffs are attempting to claim injury by invoking the same subject matter covered by the government regulatory authority, but recharacterizing it as antitrust injury, all the while seeking to recover damages for overcharged payments and allegedly excessive rates. This is a distinction without a difference.
Plaintiffs next argue that the authority of MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. (1994) 512 U.S. 218 [129 L.Ed.2d 182, 114 S.Ct. 2223] and Maislin Industries, U. S. v. Primary Steel (1990) 497 U.S. 116 [111 L.Ed.2d 94, 110 S.Ct. 2759] should indicate that the kind of market-based tariffs that are in use here are not properly regulated solely by the FPA and FERC. In Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1013, the court of appeals summarized and distinguished those same holdings in a closely analogous factual context (regulatory challenges by the state to the actions of *1314 the federal agency). The court explained the nature of these different market-based regulatory schemes as follows: “In MCI, the Supreme Court held that the FCC could not eliminate rate-filing requirements for any class of carrier, even when necessary to promote competitive markets. In Maislin, the Court held that the ICC could not allow common carriers to charge unfiled, privately negotiated rates lower than the filed rates, even when the carriers were in highly competitive markets. [Citation.] As the Court stated in Maislin, the existence of a competitive market ‘cannot provide the ICC authority to alter well-established statutory filed rate requirements.’ [Citation.]” (Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d at p. 1013.) The court of appeals then distinguished the FERC regulatory scheme from those schemes, in the course of rejecting an argument that the FERC procedures were fatally defective: “The agencies in MCI and Maislin relied on market forces alone in approving market-based tariffs. In contrast, FERC’s system consists of a finding that the applicant lacks market power (or has taken sufficient steps to mitigate market power), coupled with strict reporting requirements to ensure that the rate is ‘just and reasonable’ and that markets are not subject to manipulation. Here, FERC required the wholesale seller to file a market analysis every four months, and quarterly reports summarizing its transactions during the preceding three months. These transaction summaries include both long and short-term contracts, purportedly with reports of some sales for intervals as small as ten minutes. FERC has affirmed in its presentation before us that it is not contending that approval of a market-based tariff based on market forces alone would comply with the FPA or the filed rate doctrine. Rather, the crucial difference between MCI/Maislin and the present circumstances is the dual requirement of an ex ante finding of the absence of market power and sufficient post-approval reporting requirements. Given this, FERC argues that its market-based tariff does not run afoul of MCI or Maislin, and we agree.” (Ibid., italics added.)
Plaintiffs have provided no reason to depart from the above analysis, and disregard the fact that the FPA includes certain safeguards to oversee the reasonableness of rates for the wholesale electricity market. It does not make any difference that in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1013, the court of appeals reached those conclusions but nevertheless went on to criticize the regulatory efforts of FERC as “abdicating its regulatory responsibility.” (Id. at pp. 1014—1015.) At that time, the court of appeals accepted the argument that “even if market-based tariffs are lawful in concept, FERC failed to administer the tariffs in accordance with their terms and abused its discretion in limiting available remedies for regulatory violations.” (Id. at p. 1014.) Specifically, in Lockyer, the court found fault with FERC’s past policies as follows. First, it had implemented market-based tariffs so as to virtually deregulate the wholesale electricity industry and remove it from statutorily required oversight, but without providing appropriate safeguards, such as “enforceable *1315 post-approval reporting that would enable FERC to determine whether the rates were ‘just and reasonable’ and whether market forces were truly determining the price.” (Ibid.) Second, these crucial transactional reporting requirements were not followed during the subject time period: “Indeed, non-compliance with FERC’s reporting requirements was rampant throughout California’s energy crisis. FERC itself has acknowledged that during the height of the energy crisis the quarterly reports of several major wholesalers failed to include the transaction-specific data through which the agency at least theoretically could have monitored the California energy market .... [f] . . . fit] Thus, the very mechanism that distinguished FERC’s tariff from those prohibited by the Supreme Court in MCI and Maislin was, for all practical purposes, non-existent while energy prices skyrocketed and rolling brown-outs threatened California’s businesses and citizens.” (Ibid.)
Notwithstanding those past institutional failures on the part of FERC, the court of appeals in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, acknowledged that FERC possessed “broad remedial authority to address anti-competitive behavior” (id. at p. 1015), such as ordering reftmds in instances where utilities violated FPA provisions (exceeding approved rates or charging unapproved rates; FPA, § 205, 16 U.S.C. § 824d). 8 FERC can also order profits to be disgorged when a regulated utility fails to comply with requirements for posting rates and nondiscrimination requirements. Such remedial power (e.g., the power to order retroactive refunds) “is inherent in FERC’s authority to approve a market-based tariff in the first instance.” (Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d at pp. 1015-1016.) This result was required in order to avoid having only an illusory remedy available from FERC under a market-based tariff system. The court of appeals therefore returned the matter to FERC “to reconsider its remedial options in the first instance.” (Id. at p. 1018.)
Plaintiffs interpret all these authorities as showing that state antitrust regulation should be allowed in this instance, to fill the gaps left when FERC scaled back its activities and abdicated its regulatory responsibilities. We cannot agree, because even considering its difficult history, FERC has been provided with sufficient regulatory authority such that federal preemption principles must be applied to these antitrust/UCL challenges arising from wholesale electricity market activities. Plaintiffs acknowledge that FERC refunds are a potential remedy and offset for their claims. Moreover, they have been unable to show how any damages from defendants’ conduct, recoverable under an antitrust theory, would be separate in nature from the allegedly overpaid rates that they paid for power, which would also give rise to any refund requests. The authority of Hendricks, supra, 160 F.Supp.2d, 1155, 1163 (decided in 2001), regarding permissible concurrent theories of *1316 relief, lacks persuasiveness in light of more recent case law such as Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756 and Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641 (decided in 2004). 9 Similarly, although plaintiffs rely on Younger, supra, 26 Cal.3d 397 to contend concurrent state antitrust regulation in the wholesale market is appropriate, that case has not been extended beyond its facts pertaining to permissible investigations regarding matters within antitrust state jurisdiction, and this is not the right case to do so. (Id. at pp. 406-409.)
Plaintiffs’ attempts to rely on fundamental case law from the 1970’s and 1980’s are unsuccessful because they cannot bring themselves within those general exceptions to well-established preemption principles. Rather, the logic of the recent Ninth Circuit authority in this area is persuasive and should be followed here. (Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756.) The trial court properly sustained the demurrers on preemption grounds.
Ill
EFFECT OF FILED RATE DOCTRINE
The trial court’s ruling stated that in light of its finding that federal preemption bars plaintiffs’ claims, it was not required to reach the issue of the applicability of the filed rate doctrine. However, it concluded those principles would nevertheless bar these claims (relying on, e.g., Snohomish, supra, 384 F.3d 756; Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641; Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d 831, 851-853). All these issues have been fully briefed on appeal. Although the preemption ground alone would provide a sufficient basis to uphold the ruling on demurrer, in an abundance of caution, we will also address the closely related filed rate doctrine issues. Commentators have referred to this line of case law as applying and/or conflating the filed rate doctrine together with field and conflict preemption. (Cal. Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 2005 supp.) § 7.06, p. 41.)
“ ‘At its most basic, the filed rate doctrine provides that state law, and some federal law (e.g. antitrust law), may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question.’ [Citations.] ‘[T]he filed rate doctrine has prohibited not just a state court (or a federal court applying state law) from setting a rate different from that chosen by FERC, but also from assuming a hypothetical rate different from that actually set by FERC.’ ” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 650-651.)
*1317 Also in Grays Harbor, the court addressed contemporary concerns that application of “the filed rate doctrine to market-based rates that have not been filed with FERC would be an unwise and unprecedented expansion of the doctrine.” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 651.) The court found no such barrier to the use of this doctrine, for the following reasons: “[T]he market-based rate regime established by FERC continues FERC’s oversight of the rates charged. FERC only permits power sales at market-based rates after scrutinizing whether ‘the seller and its affiliates do not have, or have adequately mitigated, market power in generation and transmission and cannot erect other barriers to entry.’ [Citation.] According to FERC, these conditions assure that the market-based rates charged comply with the FPA’s requirement that rates be just and reasonable. [Citations.] This oversight is ongoing . ... [][]... Further, FERC contends that such procedures effectively constitute review of rates prior to their implementation. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) FERC also has a remedies provision regarding refunds in 16 United States Code section 824e(a) and (b).
Based on those factors, the court of appeals stated that “while market-based rates may not have historically been the type of rate envisioned by the filed rate doctrine, we conclude that they do not fall outside of the purview of the doctrine.” (Grays Harbor, supra, 379 F.3d 641, 651.) Although this analysis of the evolution of this regulatory method is very general in nature, it is nevertheless persuasive and we have been given no reason to depart from it here. Instead, the allegations of the master complaint amount to requests for penalties for alleged anticompetitive conduct by defendants, and these potentially would interfere with FERC supervision of market-based rates and any enforcement activities allowed under FERC procedures. We are reluctant to engage in policy analysis to the extent that plaintiffs request in this fast-changing and highly regulated area.
Moreover, in light of these conclusions, we need not address in detail plaintiffs’ limitations argument, that FERC was without jurisdiction as to conduct occurring prior to October 2, 2000, due to its own rulings about its assertion of jurisdiction as depending on the timing of events giving rise to claims filed. We find the filed rate doctrine to be instructive in this context and conclude that it reinforces our conclusions regarding preemption. (Dynegy, supra, 375 F.3d at pp. 852-853; Entergy La., Inc. v. Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n (2003) 539 U.S. 39, 47 [156 L.Ed.2d 34, 123 S.Ct. 2050] [filed rate doctrine may apply to state regulators through federal preemption under the supremacy clause].) The trial court correctly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on this ground as well.
*1318 DISPOSITION
The judgment of dismissal is affirmed. Plaintiffs are to pay the ordinary costs on appeal.

Sections 17200 through 17209 are commonly referred to as the unfair competition law or UCL. (Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 558, fn. 2 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].)

Certain of the plaintiffs, public officials whom we denote the Bustamante group, do not join in the antitrust claims but make additional UCL claims based on Penal Code violations. (Pen. Code, §§ 395, 396.) The same basic theories pertain to all the causes of action and we need not discuss these additional distinctions separately.
↵ 4
Apparently, those settlements with those other defendants also included other related claims, and are not informative with regard to the issues on this appeal.
↵ 5
In addition to suing these four major employers in the business of wholesale electric trading and marketing, plaintiffs named three individual defendants, who were management employees of the Dynegy group. No separate allegations are made about the individual defendants and we refer to all defendants collectively.
↵ 6
The ISO continues to manage the wholesale electricity market, but the PX is no longer in operation. Plaintiffs’ allegations relate to the period during which the PX was still participating in the market.
↵ 7
Plaintiffs appropriately request judicial notice on appeal of various FERC proceedings and decisions in the record, outlining the scope of its jurisdiction as granted by the FPA (16 U.S.C. § 791a et seq.). These orders and decisions deal with rate schedules and proposed market-based rates and tariffs, and are submitted by plaintiffs to provide examples of FERC’s duties to review whether rates and rate-related practices are just and reasonable, and to provide remedies for violations. (16 U.S.C. §§ 824d, 824e.) We need not discuss several of plaintiffs’ arguments made below, which are not pursued on appeal, such as the purported distinction between the roles of sellers and other participants in the market, such that “at a minimum the case should proceed against traders and generators.”
↵ 8
The FPA, § 205, cited in Lockyer, supra, 383 F.3d 1006, 1015-1016, is now codified at 16 United States Code section 824d. (U.S.C.A. Tables, vol. I, p. 251.)
↵ 9
See also T & E Pastorino v. Duke Energy Trading (9th Cir. 2005) 123 Fed.Appx. 813, holding UCL allegations regarding transactions in the wholesale energy market fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of FEA, where tariffs approved by FERC would provide the context for determination of any violations of the UCL.

Elster Electricity LLC (“Elster”) appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, granting summary judgment of invalidity for lack of enablement of U.S. Patent No. 5,457, 621 (“the ’621 patent”) in favor of defendant Schlumbergersema Inc. (“Schlumberger”). ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR (D.Del. Sept. 17, 2003). Schlumberger conditionally cross-appeals the district court’s decision granting summary judgment of literal infringement of the ’621 patent. Because the district court did not err in finding that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were not enabled, we affirm the grant of summary

In the above transformer, current flowing through the first winding causes energy to build in the transformer, which is then transferred to the second winding to produce the output voltage of the power supply. Id. at col. 6, 11. 55-65. At the same time current is transferred to the secondary winding, current is also transferred from the transformer to the third winding in order to power the connected control circuitry. Id. at col. 6,11. 65-66.
In February 2001, Elster filed suit against Schlumberger, alleging that Schlumberger’s Vectron product infringed the ’621 patent. Schlumberger cross-claimed for a declaration of invalidity and judgment of invalidity. We do not reach the merits of Schlumberger’s conditional cross-appeal.
I. BACKGROUND
Elster, formerly know as ABB Automation Inc., owns the ’621 patent. The ’621 patent is directed to the power supply of an electrical energy meter for metering electrical energy supplied by an electrical service provider. ’621 patent, col. 1, 11. 63-65. The ’621 patent teaches a power supply including a transformer having first (primary), second (secondary), and third (tertiary or bootstrap) windings. Id. at col. 2, 11. 38-39. The following is a simplified diagram illustrating the power supply:
non-infringement of the ’621 patent. Elster moved for summary judgment of literal infringement and validity with respect to the asserted claims of the ’621 patent. Schlumberger responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’621 patent. In March 2003, the district court granted Elster’s motion for summary judgment that Schlumberger literally infringed claims 1, 2, and 13 of the ’621 patent. ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR (D.Del. Mar. 27, 2003) (order). The district court further granted Schlumberger’s motion for summary judgment that the asserted claims of *916the ’621 patent were invalid for lack of enablement, while denying Elster’s cross motion. Id. On September 17, 2003, the district court entered final judgment.
Elster timely appealed. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).
II. ANALYSIS
A. Standard of Review
“We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.” Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp., 299 F.3d 1313, 1323 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). Summary judgment is only appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); SRI Int’l v. Matsushita Elec. Corp., 775 F.2d 1107, 1116 (Fed.Cir. 1985) (en banc). Claim construction is a question of law we review de novo. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1451 (Fed.Cir.1998). “Enablement is a question of law with factual underpinnings; this court reviews the ultimate legal conclusion without deference.” CFMT, Inc. v. Yieldup Int’l Corp., 349 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2003).
B. Main Appeal
Elster appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment that the ’621 patent is invalid for lack of enablement. The parties primarily dispute the correctness of the district court’s construction of “in response to” in claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent. The district court construed the phrase “a controller ... generating said control signal in response to the output of said power supply” to require that “the controller generates the control signal based on a direct reaction from the second winding.” ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR, slip op. at 3 (D.Del. Mar. 27, 2003) (claim construction order). The district court then found the ’621 patent invalid for lack of enablement, pointing out that although the claim requires that the controller directly respond to the second winding, the specification only enables a controller that responds to the third winding. ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Civil Action No. 01-077-SLR, slip op. at 10 (D.Del. Mar. 27, 2003) (memorandum opinion).
Elster argues that the district court’s claim construction is not in accordance with the plain and ordinary meaning of “in response to.” Specifically, Elster contends that the claim should be construed to cover a controller that generates a control signal in reaction to the output of the power supply, i.e., an indirect reaction to the output of the second winding, as reflected in the output of the third winding. Elster contends that an indirect response by the third winding to the second winding of the transformer is enabled by the specification. Schlumberger points out that even if the claim is construed to include an indirect and a direct response to the second winding, the written description must enable both. Schlumberger contends that under this construction, the summary judgment for invalidity was appropriate because the claim covers the third winding’s direct response to the second winding, and the written description fails to enable such a direct response.
Claim 1 of the ’621 patent provides:
1. A power supply for use in apparatus for electronically measuring or distributing electrical energy, said electrical energy defining an input voltage, said power supply comprising: *917a transformer comprising first and second windings, wherein said input voltage is provided to said first winding so that current flows through said first winding, wherein said second winding defines the output of said power supply; a switching member connected to said first winding, for permitting and preventing the flow of current through said first winding, wherein said switching member is operable in response to a control signal;
a controller connected to said switching member and to a third winding of said transformer, for generating said control signal in response to the output of said power supply; and
a voltage blocking clamp, connected to said transformer and said switching member, wherein said input voltage is applied to said voltage blocking clamp, for limiting and blocking the voltage applied to said transformer, said voltage blocking clamp comprising first and second transistors and biasing means connected to said first and second transistors, wherein said biasing means biases said first and second transistors so that the voltage provided by said voltage clocking clamp does not exceed a desired level.
’621 patent, col. 10, ll. 31-58 (emphases added). The claim recites that the “controller connected ... to a third winding” of the transformer responds “to the output of said power supply.” Id. at col. 10, ll. 45-48. The claim also recites that “the output of said power supply” is defined by the second winding. Id. at col. 10, ll. 35-39. Therefore, in order to have the controller respond to the output of the power supply, the signal in the third winding must be responsive to the signal in the second winding. The district court appeared to recognize this principle by construing the claim limitation “in response to” to require the third winding directly respond to the second winding. However, this claim construction is unduly restrictive because the claim encompasses any response — either direct or indirect — by the third winding to the second winding. Nonetheless, claims 1 and 13 are not enabled because the written description fails to teach any response between the third and second windings.
Section 112, paragraph 1 of Title 35 U.S.C. states:
The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same....
35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 1 (2000). Patent claims that are not enabled by the specification are invalid. See, e.g., AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac and Ugine, 344 F.3d 1234, 1245 (Fed.Cir.2003).
The power supply is described in the ’621 patent specification as follows:
At the end of each cycle, transistor 302 turns off and allows the energy stored in the core of transformer 300 to flow to the output of the power supply, which “output” can be generally defined by secondary [winding] 312. Simultaneously, energy flows out of the bootstrap or tertiary winding 314 to power the control circuitry 304.
’621 patent, col. 6, ll. 61-66. This passage states that both the second and third windings of the transformer are responsive to the energy stored in the transformer by the first winding. However, this passage does not teach that the third winding is responsive to the second winding. Moreover, the specification teaches away from the third winding responding to the second winding, by stating that insulation between the second and third windings is desirable *918to prevent interference between the two windings:
Any leakage inductance between the bootstrap [third] winding ... and the output [second] winding ... causes inaccurate tracking between the voltage on capacitor 332 and the output voltage of the supply. This leakage inductance can cause poor load regulation of the supply. ... Since the two windings are in direct contact, the bootstrap winding requires Teflon insulation to meet the isolation voltage specification.
Id. at col. 8, ll. 25-35. The passage teaches that interactions between the second and third windings are undesirable. Elster points to nothing in the specification that enables a response by the third winding to the second winding — either directly or indirectly. While the written description makes clear that both the second and third windings respond to signals in the first winding and to that extent are interrelated, the claim calls for the third winding to be responsive to, not merely representative of, signals in the second winding. Because the written description fails to teach a response between the second and third windings, the district court correctly concluded that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were not enabled.
C. Cross-Appeal
Because we find that the district court correctly found that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were not enabled, we do not reach the merits of the district court’s grant of summary judgment that Schlumberger literally infringed the ’621 patent. See, e.g., Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Faulding Inc., 230 F.3d 1320, 1329-30 (Fed.Cir.2000) (“Because we have upheld the district court’s determination that the asserted claims of the ... patent are invalid, it is unnecessary to address [the appellee’s] cross-appeal from the district court’s finding of infringement.”).
III. CONCLUSION
Because the district court correctly granted summary judgment that claims 1 and 13 of the ’621 patent were invalid for lack of enablement, we affirm.

           STAR ELECTRICITY d/b/a STARTEX POWER, Appellee



               On Appeal from the 129th Judicial District Court
                            Harris County, Texas

                       Trial Court Cause No. 2011-04799


  UNOPPOSED SECOND MOTION OF APPELLEE TO EXTEND TIME
                    TO FILE BRIEF

TO THE HONORABLE JUSTICES OF THE FIRST COURT OF APPEALS:

      Appellee files this Unopposed Second Motion to Extend Time to File

Appellee’s Brief, and in support thereof, shows as follows:

      1.     The deadline for Appellee to file its brief is December 30, 2015.

      2.     Appellee requests a 40-day extension until February 8, 2016 to file its

brief. Appellee has conferred with Appellant about this request, and Appellant
agreed to a 30-day extension. However, Appellee respectfully asks for an additional

10 days due to the following.

      3.     Appellee’s lead attorney had to leave town to attend depositions in

another case; he does not return until after the holiday. Moreover, Appellee’s

attorneys have trial set on January 4, 2016 in Cause no. 2012-64701 in the 269th

Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas. They also have trial set on January

25, 2016 in Cause no. 2014-03481 in the 61st Judicial District Court, Harris County,

Texas. Thus, due to the holiday travel and with the forthcoming trials, Appellee

needs additional time to file its brief.

      4.     While Appellant is unopposed to a 30-day extension, this would put

Appellee’s deadline on January 29, 2016. Such date falls on the same week

Appellee’s attorneys will be in trial in Cause no. 2014-03481. As such, Appellee

respectfully asks the Court for a total of 40 additional days to finalize and prepare

its appellate brief, thereby extending its deadline to February 8, 2016.

      5.     This is Appellee’s second request for an extension to file its brief.

                              II. Memorandum of Authorities

      6.     Tex. R. App. P. 38.6 and 10.5(b) give the Court the authority to modify

and extend the deadline to file a brief.
                                III. Relief Requested

      Appellee respectfully requests that the Court grant its Motion and extend the

deadline to file its brief until February 8, 2016. Appellee respectfully requests such

other and further relief to which it may be entitled.

                                        Respectfully Submitted,

                                        McCathern, PLLC

CITIZENS ACTION COALITION OF INDIANA, INC., Sierra Club, Inc., Valley Watch, Inc., Appellants-Intervenors, v. SOUTHERN INDIANA GAS AND ELECTRICITY COMPANY d/b/a Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc., Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, Appellees-Petitioners.
Court of Appeals Case No. 93A02-1607-EX-1637
Court of Appeals of Indiana.
February 14, 2017
*431 Attorneys for Appellants: Thomas Cmar, Oak Park, Illinois, Matthew Ger-hart, Denver, Colorado, Jennifer A. Wash-burn, Indianapolis, Indiana.
Attorneys for Appellees: Curtis T. Hill, Jr., Attorney General of Indiana, David Lee Steiner, Deputy Attorney General, Beth Krogel Roads, Jeremy R. Co-meau, Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, Wayne C. Turner, Patrick A. Ziepolt, Indianapolis, Robert E. Heidorn, P. Jason Stephenson, Evansville, Indiana.
Combined Opinion by Altice

Altice, Judge.
Case Summary
Over three years ago, Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company d/b/a Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana, Inc. (Vectren) petitioned the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) for approval of projects to modify four of Vec-tren’s coal-powered generating stations to bring them into compliance with EPA emissions standards. Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Inc., Sierra Club, Inc., and Valley Watch, Inc. (collectively, Interve-nors) intervened in the action and opposed the petition.
The IURC ultimately approved the petition, determining that Vectren’s proposed projects were reasonable and necessary under Ind. Code § 8-1-8.8-11. Upon Intervenors’ appeal in Citizens Action Coal. of Ind., Inc. v. S. Ind. Gas & Elec. Co. (Vectren I), 45 N.E.3d 483 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015), another panel of this court remanded with respect to two of the proposed projects, finding that I.C. § 8-1-8.7-3 rather than I.C. § 8-1-8.8-11 applied. This court instructed the IURC to make findings regarding the statutory factors listed in I.C. § 8-1-8.7-3 and then issue or deny a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) for the two projects.
On remand, the IURC refused a request by Intervenors to reopen the record to consider new evidence. It also issued an order analyzing the nine statutory factors, concluding that public convenience and necessity will be served by the proposed clean coal technology projects, and issuing a CPCN to Vectren for the remaining projects. Intervenors appeal once again. They argue that the IURC’s findings are not adequately explained, are arbitrary and capricious, and are not supported by substantial evi *432 dence. Additionally, Intervenors argue that the IURC unlawfully denied the petition to reopen the record.
We affirm. 1
Facts 2 & Procedural History
Vectren is a public utility company that provides electricity to southern Indiana residents. Eighty-five percent of Vectren’s baseload electricity is generated at Brown unit 1, Brown unit 2, Culley unit 2, Culley unit 3, and Warrick, all of which are coal-powered generators. In 2012, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) alleging that Vectren’s emissions control technology at its Brown units was noncom-pliant with EPA rules governing sulfuric acid emissions. The EPA also served Vec-tren with a Clean Air Act Information Request that highlighted concerns with the sulfur emissions at Culley unit 3. Vectren and the EPA eventually reached a settlement in principle to resolve the outstanding allegations raised in the NOV and the information request. Vectren also became subject to new federal mandates regarding mercury emissions standards.
On January 17, 2014, as a result of the compliance issues, Vectren filed a petition with the IURC for approval of modifications to four of its coal-powered electricity generating facilities—Brown units 1 and 2. Culley unit 3, and Warrick. The petition sought approval of several clean energy projects and issuance of a CPCN to construct, install, and use clean coal technology (CCT), 3 Among other projects, 4 Vectren requested approval for a soda ash injection system for sulfur trioxide (S03) mitigation at Brown units 1 and 2 and a hydrated lime injection system for S03 mitigation at Culley unit 3.
In April 2014, Intervenors intervened in the IURC proceedings and opposed Vectren’s petition. 5 Intervenors contended that Vectren should replace all or some of the units with new electricity-generating sources (such as, natural gas, wind, or solar) instead of retrofitting the existing coal units. According to Intervenors, this *433 would be more cost-effective for Vectren’s customers over the long run.
The dispute between Vectren and Intervenors became a battle of experts. Vectren hired the engineering firm Black & Veatch (B & V) to compare the total ratepayer cost and relative risk of the proposed modifications versus the cost and risks associated with retiring and replacing the noncompliant units.
B & V’s report found that the only feasible plans to meet environmental regulations were (1) replacing one or more of Vectren’s current units with new natural gas-powered facilities and retiring the remaining facilities, or (2) upgrading the current coal-powered facilities. B & V evaluated twenty-one potential scenarios involving various gas-powered replacement options and a range of potential market and environmental scenarios. B & V concluded that of the twenty-one scenarios, only one offered a small savings over the Mandated Projects proposal. B & V found that the cost savings under this one scenario were “marginal” and conditional on a future market scenario with low natural gas prices and high carbon prices. Accordingly, B & V concluded that Vectren’s plan to modify the existing facilities was the best option in terms of cost to ratepayers.
Id. at 487 (record cite omitted).
Intervenors submitted testimony of their expert, Dr. Jeremy I. Fisher, who felt that the 10-year period used in B & V’s' analysis was too short to capture accurate long-term costs and risks associated with the proposal and that using a 20-year model would be more appropriate. Dr. Fisher maintained that, under a 20-year analysis, natural gas-powered generators would be more cost efficient. He also noted other errors he believed B & V committed in its economic modeling, including the exclusion of wholesale capacity and energy sales.
Vectren’s President and CEO, Carl L. ’ Chapman, disagreed that Vectren should retire 85% of its generation facilities and opined that this was a riskier approach. He testified that capacity constraints, market conditions, and economic growth would create tremendous risk. He also noted that there would be significant costs left undepreciated from prior investments in the units (stranded costs). On the other hand, according to Chapman, Vec-tren’s proposed projects afforded flexibility to respond to changing market conditions, reliable capacity, and full depreciation of stranded costs.
Wayne D. Games, Vice President of Power Supply at Vectren, testified that a 20-year analysis skews the economic modeling. He also indicated that it would take 4 years to construct replacement generation and, in the meantime, customers would be exposed to market and reliability risks.
Despite the criticisms of Dr. Fisher, J. Neil Copeland of B & V continued to maintain that a 10-year model was prudent. He also disputed Dr. Fisher’s contentions of analytical errors in B & V’s model and noted problems with Dr. Fisher’s 20-year analysis. Further, Copeland indicated that the cost differences between the alternatives were fairly small and opined that decisions- about future generations should not-be made solely on these small differences. He noted the importance of management judgment and consideration of risks of capacity shortages.
On January 28, 2015, the IURC issued an order (the First Order) approving Vectren’s petition in total. The order is lengthy but only a portion of it is relevant to this appeal. After setting out in detail the evidence presented by the parties, the *434 IURC issued the following relevant discussion and findings:
C. Deferred Recovery under Ind. Code ch, 8-1-8.8. Under Ind. Code § 8-l-8.8-ll(a)(5), the Commission can authorize other financial incentives that it considers appropriate for clean energy-projects only if the projects are found to be reasonable and necessary.
Vectren submitted evidence showing that failure to comply with the federally mandated requirements would require Vectren to retire Brown, Culley, and Warrick, which make up approximately 85% of its baseload generation, in 2015. The Mandated Projects will enable the continued operation of the facilities for at least the next ten years and continued service to Vectren’s customers.
Vectren evaluated several alternative compliance technologies that would allow the Brown, Culley, and Warrick units to comply with pollution limits.... Vectren hired Black & Veatch to further evaluate the most promising technologies and consider alternatives for bringing its generation fleet in compliance with federal regulations....
* * *
Vectren also considered whether the continued operation of Brown units 1 and 2, Culley unit 3, and Warrick unit 4 was the best option. Vectren submitted production cost modeling supporting its plan to continue investing in, rather than retire, Brown, Culley, and Warrick. Specifically, Vectren presented a ten-year production cost model using PROMOD IV prepared by Black & Veatch. Vectren also engaged Burns & McDonnell to conduct an analysis over a 20-year period to respond to concerns by the Joint Intervenors and OUCC.
The evidence presented by Vectren shows that failure to complete the Mandated Projects could require the premature retirement of the related generation facilities, which would result in significant reliability, market, and regulatory risk. MISO is projecting capacity shortfalls as early as 2016 and constructing a new gas generation facility would take at least four years. Without the ability to obtain voltage support from distant generators to serve its territory, Vectren would be forced to purchase capacity in an already constrained market. All of these factors point to concerns that retirement of Brown and Culley would expose Vectren’s customers to significant reliability risks. Based on the evidence presented, we find that the Mandated Projects are reasonable and necessary.
Appellants’Appendix at 20-21.
Intervenors appealed the First Order arguing that the IURC “failed to make necessary findings on (1) facts material to its determination of the issues and (2) statutory factors required to be addressed pri- or to authorizing the use of clean coal technology.” Vectren 1, 45 N.E.3d at 485. Intervenors appealed the approval of all of Vectren’s proposed projects.
We issued our opinion in Vectren I on October 29, 2015. After a thorough review of relevant Indiana utility and CCT statutes, we determined that two of the proposed projects—those using injection systems designed to mitigate sulfur emissions—required issuance of a CPCN under I.C. chapter 8-1-8.7. 6 In its First Order, however, the IURC based its decision to approve all of the projects on I.C. chapters *435 8-1-8.4 and 8.8. 7 In light of this error, we remanded on a limited basis and instructed:
Vectren may not use CCT (as defined in Chapter 8.7) until the Commission issues them a CPCN under Indiana Code section 8-1-8.7-3. On remand, the Commission shall make findings on the factors listed in Section 8-l-8.7-3(b) regarding the soda ash and hydrated lime injection systems which qualify as CCT under Chapter 8.7 and, based on those findings, determine whether those systems serve public convenience and necessity.
Vectren I, 45 N.E.3d at 498.
On February 12, 2016, Intervenors filed a petition to reopen the evidentiary record, asserting material changes of fact since the close of the evidentiary hearing. Vectren objected to this petition.
The IURC issued its order on remand (the Second Order) on June 22, 2016. After denying Intervenors’ request to reopen the record, the IURC made findings with respect to I.C. § 8-l-8.7-3(b):
Under Ind. Code § 8-l-8.7-3(b), the Commission shall issue a CPCN if it finds that a clean coal technology project offers substantial potential to reduce sulfur or nitrogen based pollutants in a more efficient manner than conventional technologies in general use as of January 1, 1989. When determining whether to grant a CPCN, the Commission must consider specific factors, which are addressed below.
A. The costs for constructing, implementing, and using CCT compared to the costs for conventional emission reduction facilities. Vectren estimated the costs for all projects approved in [this cause] to be in the range of $75-$95 million. Vectren supplied a breakdown of the estimated costs by project as a confidential filing, which includes the estimated costs for the Brown and Culley Projects. No party disputed the estimated costs.
Ms. Fischer[ 8 ] testified that Black and Veatch considered several alternative technologies, including fuel switching, coal washing, boiler flue gas temperature control, furnace sorbent injection, and others. Ms. Fischer further testified that the Brown and Culley Projects were selected because the preliminary screening showed them to be the most cost effective. The evidence presented sufficiently describes the Mandated Projects Costs and demonstrates that the components of the Mandated Projects offer substantial potential to cost-effectively reduce pollutants.
B. Whether a CCT project will extend the useful life of an existing electric generating facility and the value of that extension. Mr. Games testified that the Brown and Culley Units have not reached the end of their useful lives. He said that the Brown and Culley Projects are necessary to resolve the [NOV] issued by the [EPA] and to allow the continued operation of the Brown and Culley Units. Mr. Chap *436 man testified that the Brown and Culley Projects would extend the useful lives of Vectren’s plant for another ten years, allowing Vectren to fully depreciate its prior capital investments in emission controls and to avoid stranded costs.
C. The potential reduction of sulfur and nitrogen based pollutants achieved by the proposed CCT system. Mr. Games testified that under the NOV, Vectren has agreed to install sodium-based sulfur trioxide (“S03”) mitigation systems on both Brown Units. The systems will reduce sulfuric acid (“H2S04”) emissions to 0.008 lb/mmbtu (pounds per million British thermal units) on Brown Unit 1 and 0.010 lb/mmbtu on Brown Unit 2. Vectren has also agreed to install a S03 mitigation system on Culley Unit 3, which will reduce H2S04 emissions to 0.009 lb/ mmbtu.
D. The reduction of sulfur and nitrogen based pollutants that can be achieved by conventional pollution control equipment. Mr. Games testified that soda ash injection (Brown Units) and hydrated lime injection (Culley Unit) are required for SOs mitigation. There is no evidence that any conventional pollution control equipment could achieve the necessary S03 reductions. Vectren analyzed several alternative technologies and fuel sources to achieve the necessary S03 reductions, but that analysis focused primarily on the economic impact of the scenarios.
E. Federal sulfur and nitrogen based pollutant emission standards. Mrs. Retherford[ 9 ] testified that Vectren received an NOV from the EPA alleging that Vectren failed to acquire Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction permits prior to construction of the SCRs to address small incremental increases in incidental S03 emissions caused by operation of the SCRs, and a CAA § 114 Information Request related to the 2003 Culley Consent Decree. Vectren and the EPA have reached a settlement in principle to resolve the outstanding compliance allegations brought by the EPA in the NOV and the CAA § 114 Information Request that requires the Culley and Brown Air Projects.
F.The likelihood of success of the proposed project. Ms. Fischer described the Phase 1 Technology Demonstration of the Brown and Culley Projects. At Brown, Black & Veatch used a temporary soda ash injection system, which treated 100% of the flue gas on Unit 1. The soda ash injection reagent flow rate, process data, and stack gas outlet measurements were all collected, and the data obtained allowed Black <& Veatch to determine the optimum amount of soda ash that should be injected to balance sorbent consumption, mercury reduction, and NbS04 mist reduction.
Ms. Fischer testified that at Culley, highly reactive hydrated lime was injected at the inlet and outlet of the particulate matter removal device. Black & Veatch performed the test at different injection rates to evaluate the effect of the amount of hydrated *437 lime injection on H2S04 mist removal. As with Brown, the data obtained allowed Black & Veatch to determine the necessary sizing of the lime injection system.
G.The cost and feasibility of retirement of an existing electric generating facility. Mr. Games testified that Vectren hired Burns & McDonald and Black & Veatch to analyze alternative generation options to retrofitting Brown Units 1 and 2 and Culley Unit 3. The analysis included both the variable operating costs of the proposed alternatives and the annual fixed charge required to recover capital costs and fixed operating costs under various capacity scenarios. In addition, the analysis considered that the Brown and Culley Units are base load units; so any replacement technology must be able to supply the necessary capacity to meet the MISO-required Planning Reserve Margin.
The analysis considered 20 commercial generating technologies, including seven natural gas options, battery storage, compressed air, wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, wood, landfill gas, and coal. Of those options, Black & Veatch identified two, a 200 MW, Class F natural gas fired generation facility and a 300 MW natural gas fired combined cycle generation facility, as the most practical options. The other options were determined to be infeasible due to cost, size, or environmental reasons.
Black & Veatch compared the two replacement options to the retrofitting option on the basis of total customer cost and relative risk. The analysis was run under three separate market scenarios and adjusted to those scenarios for variables including natural gas costs and carbon costs. The analysis compared 21 different replacement scenarios to the retrofitting option, and in every scenario except one, the analysis demonstrated that retrofitting was the lowest cost alternative. The only scenario that favored replacement, was a low natural gas and high carbon cost scenario that showed a 2.2% benefit by replacing Brown Units 1 and 2 with a combined cycle natural gas facility.
H. The dispatching priority for the facility utilizing CCT, considering direct fuel costs, revenues, and expenses of the utility, and environmental factors associated with byproducts resulting from the utilization of the CCT. Mr. Games testified that any changes in dispatching priority will depend on future regulations, fuel costs, and future load growth. He said that the additional variable production costs of using additives to reduce SOs emissions will increase the cost to generate a MW of electricity, but that Black & Veatch’s analysis shows that replacing the Brown and Culley Units would be a more expensive option.
Mr. Games also testified that the Brown and Culley Projects will allow for the continued reuse of the fly ash from the Brown and Culley Units for the production of cement and gypsum wall board. Mr. Games said that while Vectren is not paid for the fly ash, the reuse is beneficial to customers because Vectren avoids disposal costs.
I. Any other factors the Commission considers relevant, including whether the construction, implementation, and use of CCT is in the public’s interest. Mr. Games testified that Vectren cannot contin *438 ue to operate the Brown and Culley Units without investing in additional pollution control equipment to comply with the NOV. Vectren has evaluated alternative technologies and the possibility of retiring the units and identified the Brown and Culley Projects as the lowest cost alternative. Retiring the Brown and Culley Units would retire 76% of Vectren’s coal-fired base load, which would require Vectren to construct new generation facilities to replace the capacity or to purchase capacity on the open market. Market Purchases would also place a large percentage of Vectren’s base load energy need outside of its direct control. Because the Brown and Culley Units have not reached the end of their useful lives, retiring them early would result in significant stranded costs. In addition, Vectren would experience stranded costs related to infrastructure in place to capture, store, and transport fly ash for reuse. For these reasons, we find that it is in the public interest for Vectren to install the Brown and Culley Projects.
J. Conclusion. Based on our analysis of the factors required by Ind. Code § S—1—8.7—3(b), we find that public convenience and necessity will be served by the use of CCT, specifically the Brown and Culley Projects, on Brown Units 1 and 2 and Culley Unit 3. In our January 28, 2015 Order in this Cause, we approved the estimated costs, and found that Brown Units 1 and 2 and Culley Unit 3 will continue to utilize Indiana coal as their primary fuel, specifically coal [ ] sourced from the Illinois Basin. Therefore, we issue a CPCN to Vectren for the Brown and Culley Projects.
Id. at 8-11. 10 Intervenors appeal from this order.
Discussion & Decision
Standard of Review
The General Assembly created the IURC primarily as a fact-finding body with the technical expertise to administer the regulatory scheme devised by the legislature. N. Ind. Pub. Serv. Co. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 907 N.E.2d 1012, 1015 (Ind. 2009). The IURC’s goal is to ensure that public utilities provide constant, reliable, and efficient service to the citizens of Indiana. Id. An order from the IURC is presumed valid unless the contrary is clearly apparent. Citizens Action Coal. of Ind., Inc. v. N. Ind. Pub. Serv. Co., 485 N.E.2d 610, 612 (Ind. 1985).
The standard for our review of decisions of the IURC is governed by I.C. § 8—1—3—1, which our courts have interpreted as providing a tiered standard of review.
A multiple-tier standard of review is applicable to the IURC’s orders. A court on review must inquire whether specific findings exist as to all factual determinations material to the ultimate conclusions; whether substantial evidence within the record as a whole supports the findings of fact; and whether the decision, ruling, or order is contrary to law.
Vectren I, 45 N.E.3d at 491. In applying this standard, “[w]e review the conclusions of ultimate facts, or mixed questions of fact and law, for their reasonableness, with greater deference to matters within the IURC’s expertise and jurisdiction.” Citizens Action Coal. of Ind., Inc. v. Duke *439 Energy Ind., Inc., 16 N.E.3d 449, 457 (Ind. Ct. App. 2014). Additionally, “[w]e neither reweigh the evidence nor assess the credibility of witnesses and consider only the evidence most favorable to the IURC’s findings.” Ind. Gas Co., Inc. v. Ind. Fin. Auth., 999 N.E.2d 63, 66 (Ind. 2013). On matters within its jurisdiction, the IURC enjoys wide discretion and its findings and decision will not be lightly overridden simply because we might reach a different decision on the same evidence. Vectren I, 45 N.E.3d at 491.
Adequacy of Findings on Remand
Intervenors challenge the adequacy of the IURC’s findings on remand, arguing that they are not adequately explained, are arbitrary and capricious, and are not supported by substantial evidence. Their grievance stems from the notion that the IURC failed to consider any evidence other than Vectren’s pre-filed direct testimony. Had the IURC considered the other evidence, according to Intervenors, it would have concluded that the long-term cost of installing pollution controls on the existing units would be more than the cost of building new natural gas plants and retiring existing coal-fired units.
Initially, we observe that the First Order remained intact after Vectren I. This order contained a detailed summary of the evidence presented by the parties, which included over 2000 pages of written testimony and exhibits and two days of live testimony. Although the IURC considered the voluminous evidence on both sides, it based its ultimate decision and findings in the First Order primarily on Vectren’s evidence. For example, in finding the proposed projects to be reasonable and necessary, the IURC expressly relied upon the evidence presented by Vectren, including Games’s testimony and the B & V 10-year model. The IURC’s reliance on the B & V model indicates that Vectren won the battle of the experts in the First Order.
In Vectren I, we did not reverse the First Order. Rather, we did nothing more than remand for additional findings with regard to two of the proposed projects. We directed the IURC to make findings on the nine statutory factors listed in I.C. § 8-1-8.7-3(b) and balance these factors to determine whether to grant a CPCN. The IURC did just that.
We cannot agree with Intervenors that, on remand, the IURC was required to consider the expert testimony regarding the cost models anew. Further, Interve-nors’ assertion that Copeland abandoned his original B & V 10-year analysis for a “corrected analysis” at the hearing is a mischaracterization of the evidence. Appellants’ Brief at 21. At the hearing, Copeland steadfastly stood by his opinion that a 10-year analysis was more appropriate than a 20-year analysis. 11 Further, to the extent he adjusted the assumptions used in his 10-year model to reflect Dr. Fisher’s assumptions, Copeland testified that he was “not totally in agreement” with the assumptions. 12 Id. at 374. Additionally, *440 Copeland testified that the revised results should “absolutely not” change Vectren’s conclusions on the proposed compliance plan. Id. at 373. He noted that “changes in the variable costs can change the outcome very easily” and given the “uncertainty in the future, [he] would not think it would be prudent to make an $800 million fixed cost investment”. Id. at 374.
Intervenors’ arguments amount, essentially, to a claim that the IURC credited the wrong expert testimony. This is an improper contention on appeal, as it requires a reweighing of the evidence. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the IURC’s findings regarding the cost effectiveness of the proposed projects as compared to retirement of the existing units. Moreover, the cost analysis was not the sole basis of the IURC’s decision to issue the CPCN to Vectren. The IURC issued specific findings on all nine statutory factors as set out above, many of which had nothing to do with the cost analysis. Based on its consideration of all of these factors, the IURC determined that public convenience and necessity will be served by the use of CCT at Brown Units 1 and 2 and Culley Unit 3. Intervenors have failed to establish that the IURC abused the broad discretion granted it.
Petition to Reopen Record
Intervenors argue that the IURC erred by declining to reopen the record on remand to hear additional evidence. With their petition, Intervenors attached evidence purporting to show that the existing units would face higher costs than originally assumed and the cost to run new plants would be lower. Other evidence submitted indicated that the projections of a capacity deficit in the region were no longer accurate.
The IURC denied the petition as follows:
170 IAC 1-1.1-22 allows a party to move to reopen the record[ 13 ] “At any time after the record is closed, but before a final order is issued.” The Commission has already issued a final order based on the evidentiary hearing in this Cause. Although the Court of Appeals remanded the final order for the Commission to consider the limited issue of whether a CPCN should be issued for the proposed soda ash and hydrated lime injection systems, the court did not instruct the Commission to receive additional evidence; nor did it bar the Commission from i-eceiving additional evidence if necessary. Therefore, it is within the Commission’s discretion to determine whether the record should be reopened to receive additional evidence.
In this case, we find that there is sufficient evidence in the evidentiary record to make the required findings under Ind. Code § 8-1-8.7-3. [Intervenors], in asserting that new evidence might *441 change the original analysis, amounts to a request that the Commission engage in hindsight review, which we decline to do. Therefore, the Motion is denied.
Appellants’Appendix at 8.
In its First Order, the IURC granted Vectren’s petition for approval of all the proposed projects. In Vectren I, this court did not reverse the First Order but simply remanded the case for additional findings with respect to two of the projects. Given the volatile utility market, the cost analy-ses and facts on which the First Order was based were sure to change over time (i.e., while the First Order was being appealed) but this is no reason to require the IURC to reopen the evidence and re-litigate the case with respect to the two remaining projects.
Under the circumstances presented here, we conclude that the IURC did not abuse its discretion by denying the petition to reopen the record. There was ample evidence in the record from which the IURC could evaluate the statutory factors on remand, and thus there was no need for additional evidence. See Citizens Action Coal. of Ind., Inc. v. Duke Energy Ind., Inc., 44 N.E.3d 98, 110 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015).
Affirmed.
Riley, J. and Crone, J., concur. 1
. By separate order issued today, we grant Intervenors’ motion to dismiss the IURC as a party to this appeal. We agree that because the IURC acted as a fact-finding administrative tribunal and no statute or administrative provision expressly makes the IURC a party on appeal, it is not a proper party on appeal from its own decision. See City of Terre Haute v. Terre Haute Water Works Corp., 133 Ind. App. 232, 180 N.E.2d 110, 111 (1962) (""When there are two opposing parties before [the Public Service Commission of Indiana], as here, its action in making findings and issuing an order deemed detrimental by one of the parties is similar to that of a court which makes a decision determining a controversy between adverse parties. A court is never a party to an appeal from its decision.”); Cf. Ind. Code § 22-4-17-12(b) (expressly making the Review Board of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development a party appellee in every appeal of the review board’s decision).

          DeHOOG, J.
          Oregon water law authorizes the granting of water
rights, which, among other things, permit water-rights
holders to acquire specific quantities of water to use for spe-
cific, beneficial purposes. A water right may not be granted
if the new water right would injure a senior right holder’s
water right or if the proposed use of the water would be con-
trary to the public interest. In this case, the Oregon Water
Resources Commission (commission)1 denied petitioner East
Valley Water District’s (East Valley or district) application
to store water in a reservoir that the district planned to
create by building a dam within a creek’s streambed. East
Valley petitions this court to review a decision of the Court
of Appeals affirming the commission’s final order denying
that application. In its final order, the commission concluded
that East Valley’s proposed storage of water from the creek
would impair or be detrimental to the public interest under
ORS 537.170(8)(f) because it would “frustrate the benefi-
cial purpose” of an existing in-stream water right on the
creek and would not provide the means necessary to pro-
tect that right. East Valley sought judicial review in the
Court of Appeals, contending, among other things, that the
commission had erred in protecting the beneficial purpose
of the existing water right and not merely the quantity of
water available to fulfill that right, but that court affirmed
the commission’s final order. East Valley Water v. Water
Resources Commission, 328 Or App 790, 539 P3d 789 (2023).
We allowed East Valley’s petition for review, and, for the
reasons that follow, we conclude that the beneficial purpose
or use for which a water right has been granted is a pro-
tected public interest and that the commission did not err
in considering that use in determining the public interest.
We further conclude, however, that the commission erred in
failing to consider all the statutorily required public inter-
est factors in making its final determination regarding the

part the decision of the Court of Appeals, and we remand
the case to the commission for further proceedings.
                           I. BACKGROUND
A. Brief Overview of the Dispute
         East Valley is an irrigation district established in
2000 by a collective of Willamette Valley farmers under
ORS 545.025 (setting out process for formation of irriga-
tion districts). East Valley’s geographic boundaries are in
Marion County and extend from north of Silverton to south
of Woodburn and Molalla; the district is bordered by the
Pudding River on the west and the Cascade Mountain foot-
hills on the east. The district was created for the purpose
of obtaining the permits necessary to construct and store
water in a reservoir that would provide its members with a
source of water for irrigation.
        In February 2013, East Valley submitted a
water storage application to the Oregon Water Resources
Department (department).3 The application sought approval
for a reservoir that would store 12,000 acre-feet of water
each year, from October 1 through April 30, for “irrigation,
supplemental irrigation, and flow augmentation as may
be required for the approval of this irrigation reservoir by
[the department].” Construction on the project would begin
within 10 years of a permit being issued. The reservoir
would be created by constructing a dam on Drift Creek, a
    2
       In the Court of Appeals, East Valley’s first assignment of error asserted
that the commission had acted outside the range of discretion delegated to it by
law by denying its application based on a perceived deficiency in the director’s
final order that was not specifically raised in the exceptions filed by the protes-
tants. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument without discussion, and East
Valley does not renew it in this court. We therefore also affirm that part of the
Court of Appeals’ decision.
    3
       The district applied for a storage permit that would allow it only to store
water. If that permit were granted, it would be merely the first step in the per-
mitting process. Before beginning construction, East Valley would need to obtain
approval of dam specifications from the department’s Dam Safety Office. In addi-
tion, the dam would have to be approved by the federal Army Corps of Engineers,
which, in turn, also requires certification from the federal Department of
Environmental Quality. And before making use of the water, the district would
have to obtain another permit from the department authorizing it to use the
water for irrigation and other purposes. Separately, the district also would need
to obtain permits from a variety of other local, state, and federal agencies.
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                    153

tributary of the Pudding River. The proposed height of the
dam would be approximately 70 feet above the streambed
or ground surface at the center of the dam’s crest. The area
submerged by the reservoir when full would be approxi-
mately 384 acres. When full, the reservoir would inundate
land presently belonging to other local farmers (referred to
in these proceedings as the Rue Protestants), and, when it
was not full, that land would be unusable mudflats. East
Valley, as a water district, plans to take ownership of the
land inundated by the reservoir through eminent domain.4
          As we will explain in more detail below, the depart-
ment issued a proposed final order in 2014 granting the dis-
trict’s application. The Rue Protestants and WaterWatch of
Oregon5 (together, the protestants) challenged the proposed
final order,6 and the matter was referred to a hearing before
an administrative law judge (ALJ). In February 2019,
the ALJ issued a proposed order recommending that the
department approve the requested water permit with minor
modifications. The protestants filed exceptions to the ALJ’s
proposed order, after which the director of the department
issued a final order affirming the ALJ’s proposed order. The
protestants then filed exceptions to the director’s final order
with the commission, and, in November 2019, the commis-
sion issued its own final order reversing the director’s final
order and denying East Valley’s application. East Valley
petitioned for judicial review of the commission’s final order,
and the Court of Appeals affirmed. East Valley now chal-
lenges the commission’s final order on review.

     4
       Irrigation districts must own or have legal access to land directly impacted
by a reservoir. ORS 537.400 (requiring showing that permittee owns or has writ-
ten authorization or an easement permitting access to all lands inundated by
a reservoir before reservoir permit is issued). Irrigation districts such as East
Valley may acquire the inundated property through the exercise of eminent
domain under ORS 545.239.
     5
       WaterWatch identifies itself as a “nonprofit membership organization dedi-
cated to promoting water allocation decisions in Oregon that provide the quality
and quantity of water necessary to support fish, wildlife, recreation, biological
diversity, ecological values, public health and a sound economy.”
     6
       The Rue Protestants oppose the project primarily because of its effect on
their land. They argued below that monetary compensation through eminent
domain would not fully compensate them for the loss of land that has been in
their families for generations. WaterWatch opposes the project primarily because
of its impact on fish habitat.
154        East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

          To understand the historical and procedural facts
leading to the commission’s final order and the basis for that
order, it is helpful to start with an overview of Oregon’s water
law and the process for obtaining a permit to appropriate
water, thereby establishing a new water right. Thus, we will
briefly explain that statutory framework before turning to
the facts of this case.
B.    Statutory Framework
      1. Law concerning appropriation and allocation of
         water in Oregon
          Oregon’s Water Rights Act, first enacted in 1909 as
the Oregon Water Code, Or Laws 1909, chapter 216, governs
how water in the state is appropriated and allocated. See
ORS 537.010 (setting out the various statutes, across differ-
ent chapters, that make up the Water Rights Act).7 Under
that act, “[a]ll water within the state from all sources of water
supply belongs to the public.” ORS 537.110. An individual or
entity can acquire a water right by obtaining a permit to
appropriate water for a “beneficial use” and complying with
the provisions of the act. ORS 537.120. The term “benefi-
cial use” is not specifically defined by statute, but qualifying
beneficial uses include domestic use, municipal water sup-
ply, irrigation, power development, industrial use, mining,
recreation, conservation of fish and wildlife, and pollution
abatement. See, e.g., ORS 536.300(1) (declaring those uses of
water to be “beneficial uses”); ORS 537.170(8)(a) (identifying
such uses as among the “highest use of the water”); ORS
537.625(3)(a) (requiring the commission to consider “con-
servation of the highest use” of water for those purposes in
making a final determination whether a proposed use would
preserve the public welfare); ORS 543.225(3)(a) (identifying
    7
      Under the Water Rights Act, water rights appropriated for beneficial uses
after the effective date of the act—February 24, 1909—are generally governed
by ORS chapter 537, while rights to water that had been appropriated before
that date were not superseded but were required to be determined through the
process codified in ORS chapter 539. See Klamath Irrigation District v. Water
Res. Dept., 321 Or App 581, 584, 518 P3d 970 (2022) (describing the effect of the
Water Rights Act); Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Lynch, 215 Or 523, 548, 
336 P2d884 (1959) (noting the division in Oregon law “between the procedure set out in
Ch 539 for the determination of water rights initiated before the adoption of the
water code on February 24, 1909, and the procedure incident to the granting,
denying and cancellation of [water rights] permits after that date”).
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                   155

such uses as among the “highest use of the water”). The
department’s administrative rules provide their own defi-
nition of “beneficial use,” defining it as “the reasonably effi-
cient use of water without waste for a purpose consistent
with the laws, rules and the best interests of the people of
the state.” OAR 690-077-0010(3).
         Before appropriating water for beneficial use and
constructing the necessary works, such as a dam and reser-
voir, an individual or entity must obtain a permit from the
department. ORS 537.130(1). A permit application is subject
to public interest review under ORS 537.153. Upon determin-
ing that a proposed appropriation is for a beneficial use and
that the applicant has complied with the other provisions of
the act, the department issues a water-right certificate. ORS
537.250(1). The right to the use of water as set out in the
certificate continues in the owner of the certificate “so long
as the water shall be applied to a beneficial use under and in
accordance with the terms of the certificate.” ORS 537.250(3)
(a). However, the right is subject to loss by nonuse. Id.; ORS
540.610(1) (if the owner of a water right ceases or fails to use
all or part of the appropriated water for five years, a rebutta-
ble presumption of forfeiture of the right arises).
         The Water Rights Act codifies the common-law
doctrine of prior appropriation, in which the first person to
apply water to a beneficial use acquires the “right” to use the
appropriated water for that purpose.8 Teel Irrigation Dist. v.
Water Res. Dept., 323 Or 663, 666-67, 919 P2d 1172 (1996);
see also Fort Vannoy Irrigation v. Water Res. Comm’n, 
345Or 56, 64-66, 188 P3d 277 (2008) (discussing history of the
appropriation doctrine and the Water Rights Act). Others
may later acquire the right to use previously appropriated
water, but a holder of a senior right—a right that was estab-
lished earlier, giving it an earlier priority date—is enti-
tled to receive water before the holder of a junior right may
    8
      In Fort Vannoy Irrigation v. Water Resources Comm., 345 Or 56, 64-66, 
188P3d 277 (2008), this court explained that, historically, Oregon water law embod-
ied two doctrines that provided the bases for the right to use surface water. In
addition to the doctrine of appropriation, Oregon law recognized the riparian
doctrine, under which water rights were based on a party’s ownership of land
adjacent to a water source, rather than on the party’s beneficial use of the water
as with prior appropriation. Id. However, the court further explained, with the
enactment of the Water Rights Act in 1909, the appropriation doctrine prevailed.
156      East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

exercise its right. ORS 537.120 (providing that “all waters of
the state” may be appropriated for beneficial use “[s]ubject
to existing rights,” and nothing in the act may be construed
to “take away or impair the vested right of any person to
any water or to the use of any water”); ORS 537.153(2) (in
reviewing an application for a water right, the department
must consider, among other things, whether the proposed
use will injure other water rights); Fort Vannoy, 
345 Orat 64-65 (explaining that, as early as the 1840s to 1850s,
when questions arose concerning the right to use streams,
Oregonians applied a “first in time, first in right” rule, under
which the first person to divert water had a prior right to it
to the extent of the diversion, for use on both riparian and
nonriparian land); McCall v. Porter, 42 Or 49, 57, 70 P 820(1902), reh’g den, 42 Or 49, 71 P 976 (1903) (“The waters of
a natural stream are subject to successive appropriations,
and, so long as the subsequent appropriators do not injure
or impair the rights of those prior to them, they may use as
much water as they choose.”).
         A water right may be consumptive, insofar as the
water is diverted out of a stream and consumed—for exam-
ple, water used for irrigation—or it may be an “in-stream”
right, defined in ORS 537.332(3) as
   “a water right held in trust by the Water Resources
   Department for the benefit of the people of the State of
   Oregon to maintain water in-stream for public use. An
   in-stream water right does not require a diversion or any
   other means of physical control over the water.”
In other words, in-stream rights are by definition not con-
sumptive; their beneficial purpose derives from water
remaining in the stream. Moreover, by maintaining water
in-stream for public uses, in-stream rights benefit the public
at large rather than a person, a small group of people, or a
private enterprise. ORS 537.332(4) (so defining “public ben-
efit”). “Public uses” under the statute include, among other
things, “[c]onservation, maintenance and enhancement of
aquatic and fish life, wildlife, fish and wildlife habitat and
any other ecological values.” ORS 537.332(5)(b). Public uses
are “beneficial uses.” ORS 537.334(1) (so stating). A certificate
for an in-stream water right has the same legal status as any
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                    157

other water right for which a certificate has been issued. ORS
537.350(1). That is, like any other certificated water right, a
certificated in-stream right is vested,9 and the attributes and
priority date of an in-stream water right must be given the
same protection as any other water right. See Teel Irrigation
Dist, 323 Or at 668 (“The certificate represents a vested,
perfected water right that continues so long as the water is
applied to a beneficial use in accordance with the terms of the
certificate, subject to loss by nonuse and other events.”).
         ORS 537.336 authorizes various state agencies to
request in-stream water rights. Specifically, as relevant
here, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW)
is authorized to request the department to issue water-
rights certificates on waters in the state “in which there are
public uses relating to the conservation, maintenance and
enhancement of aquatic and fish life, wildlife[,] and fish and
wildlife habitat.” ORS 537.336(1). A request for an in-stream
water right “shall be for the quantity of water necessary to
support those public uses as recommended by [ODFW].”
Id. The minimum quantity of water necessary to support
the public use requested is known as the “in-stream flow.”
ORS 537.332(2). Under ORS 537.341, the commission issues
in-stream water-right certificates in the name of the depart-
ment as trustee for the people of Oregon.
     2. Law concerning review of applications for water
        rights
          Under ORS 537.130, any person intending to acquire
the right to the beneficial use of water in this state must
apply to the department for a permit to make the appropri-
ation. If the department determines (1) that the application
is complete, (2) that the proposed use is not prohibited out-
right by statute, and (3) that there are no immediate legal or
other barriers that may limit or preclude approval, then the
department notifies the applicant of its preliminary deter-
minations before undertaking an initial review of the appli-
cation. ORS 537.150(2) - (5). Upon proceeding to that ini-
tial review, the department also must publish notice of, and
request public comment on, the application. ORS 537.150(6).
     9
       A “vested” water right is a final, perfected water right evidenced by a cer-
tificate. Fort Vannoy, 345 Or at 76.
158        East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

         In conducting its initial review of an application,
the department must presume that the proposed use of the
water will not impair or be detrimental to the public interest
if four criteria are met: (1) the proposed use is permissible,
(2) water is available; (3) the proposed use will not injure
other water rights, and (4) the proposed use complies with
the commission’s rules. ORS 537.153(2). This is a rebuttable
presumption, and it may be overcome by a preponderance of
evidence showing either that one or more of the criteria for
establishing the presumption is not in fact satisfied or that
the proposed use will impair or be detrimental to the public
interest. Id. The department then completes its review of the
application and issues a proposed final order approving the
application, approving it with or modifications or conditions,
or denying the application altogether. ORS 537.153(1).
         Any person may protest a proposed final order.10 ORS
537.153(6). Within 60 days of the close of the period for receiv-
ing protests, the department director must either issue a final
order as provided in ORS 537.170(6) or, if a protest has been
filed and the director finds that there are significant disputes
related to the proposed use of water, schedule a contested case
hearing before an ALJ. ORS 537.153(8). The contested case
proceeding generally is conducted in accordance with the pro-
visions of ORS chapter 183 governing such proceedings. ORS
537.622(3). At the conclusion of the contested case proceeding,
the ALJ issues a proposed order that includes recommended
findings of fact and conclusions of law. ORS 183.470(2). Parties
may file exceptions to the ALJ’s proposed order. OAR 690-
002-0175. After a contested case hearing, or, if a hearing is
not held, after the close of the period for filing protests, the
director issues a final order either approving or rejecting the
application. ORS 537.170(6). Any person may file exceptions to
the director’s final order with the commission. ORS 537.173(1).
The commission must then issue a modified order or an order
denying the exceptions within 60 days of the close of the
exception period. ORS 537.173(2). Any party affected by the
commission’s final order in a contested case may seek review
of the order in the Court of Appeals. ORS 536.075(2).
    10
       In addition, any person who supports a proposed final order may request
standing for purposes of participating in any contested case proceeding on the
proposed final order or for judicial review of a final order. ORS 537.153(5).

C. Historical Facts
          With that legal framework in mind, we turn to the
historical facts.11 In 2013, East Valley filed a water storage
application with the department, requesting a permit to build
a dam and create a reservoir to store water from Drift Creek
and some of its tributaries. In July 2014, the department
issued a proposed final order recommending approval of East
Valley’s application with certain conditions. In arriving at
that recommendation, the department first determined that
East Valley was entitled to the rebuttable presumption under
ORS 537.153(2) that its proposed water storage would not
be detrimental to the public interest, because it found that
(1) the proposed use was permissible; (2) water was available;
(3) the proposed use would not injure other water rights; and
(4) the proposed use complied with the commission’s rules.
The department then turned to consider whether the rebut-
table presumption that the proposed use was in the public
interest had been overcome. Under ORS 537.153(2)(b), one
way in which that presumption can be overcome is by a pre-
ponderance of evidence indicating that the use would impair
or detrimentally affect one or more of the seven public interest
considerations set out in ORS 537.170(8),12 including, among
other things, “all vested and inchoate rights to the waters
     11
        We take the facts, which are undisputed, from the commission’s factual
findings, which, in turn, adopt and incorporate the factual findings set out in the
director’s final order.
     12
        The seven public interest considerations set out in ORS 537.170(8) are as
follows:
         “(a) Conserving the highest use of the water for all purposes, including
    irrigation, domestic use, municipal water supply, power development, pub-
    lic recreation, protection of commercial and game fishing and wildlife, fire
    protection, mining, industrial purposes, navigation, scenic attraction or any
    other beneficial use to which the water may be applied for which it may have
    a special value to the public.
        “(b) The maximum economic development of the waters involved.
        “(c) The control of the waters of this state for all beneficial purposes,
    including drainage, sanitation and flood control.
        “(d) The amount of waters available for appropriation for beneficial use.
        “(e) The prevention of wasteful, uneconomic, impracticable or unreason-
    able use of the waters involved.
         “(f) All vested and inchoate rights to the waters of this state or to the use
    of the waters of this state, and the means necessary to protect such rights.
        “(g) The state water resources policy formulated under ORS 536.295 to
    536.350 and 537.505 to 537.534.”
160         East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

of this state or to the use of the waters of this state, and the
means necessary to protect such rights.” ORS 537.170(8)(f).
Regarding that consideration, the department concluded
that “[a]ll vested water rights are protected by their respec-
tive priority dates, the prior appropriation system, and the
[d]epartment’s regulatory procedures.”13
         In September 2014, the protestants filed protests
to the department’s proposed final order, and a contested
case hearing was scheduled. The hearing took place in June
2018. In that proceeding, the protestants argued, among
other things, that the proposed use would impair an exist-
ing water right: the right provided for in Certificate 72591.14
In 1996, the commission had issued Certificate 72591, an
in-stream water right issued for Drift Creek under ORS
537.341 for the purpose of “[p]roviding required stream flows
for cutthroat trout for migration, spawning, egg incubation,
fry emergence, and juvenile rearing.” Certificate 72591
has a priority date of October 18, 1990, and it guarantees
a specific in-stream flow and includes certain conditions,
including condition 5, which provides, “The flows are to be
measured at the lower end of the stream reach to protect
necessary flows throughout the reach.”15 The protestants
argued that inundating part of Drift Creek would impair
or be detrimental to that in-stream water right because it
would adversely affect the habitat and ability to spawn of
various fish species that live in the creek, including cut-
throat trout. Notwithstanding that objection, the ALJ issued
a proposed order in February 2019 recommending that the
department approve the requested permit, subject to minor
modifications.
    13
       The department also considered the other six public interest factors in
ORS 537.170(8) and concluded that the presumption had not been overcome by a
preponderance of evidence under any of the public interest factors.
    14
       In addition to Certificate 72591, a second water right exists on Drift Creek
within the projected footprint of the reservoir. Certificate 36095, known as the
Schact water right, has a priority date of August 3, 1967, and is owned by one of
the Rue Protestants. It permits storage of up to 3.4 acre-feet of water each year
for a fishpond. The land on which the fishpond is located would be inundated
by the East Valley reservoir and is part of the land that East Valley intends to
acquire by eminent domain if its application is approved. The Schact water right
is not at issue in this proceeding.
    15
       The parties agree that the “lower end of the stream” means the mouth of
Drift Creek, at the confluence with the Pudding River.

         The protestants filed exceptions to that proposed
order, and the director issued a final order affirming, with
limited modifications, both the department’s proposed final
order and the ALJ’s proposed order. In so doing, the director
made findings of fact, which the commission later adopted
in their entirety and incorporated by reference in its own
final order.
          Among other things, the director found—for pur-
poses of determining whether, under ORS 537.153(2), the
rebuttable presumption that the proposed storage of water
would not be detrimental to the public interest applied—that
(1) the proposed use was permissible; (2) water was available;
(3) the proposed use would not injure other water rights; and
(4) the proposed use complied with the commission’s rules.
With respect to the third factor—whether the proposed use
would “injure” existing water rights, ORS 537.153(2)—the
director noted that the commission had no administrative
rule defining “injure” in the context of new water rights, but
its practice was to construe that term as its rules defined it
for purposes of proposed transfers of water rights. In that
context, OAR 690-380-0100(3) provides that “ ‘[i]njury’ or ‘[i]
njury to an existing water right’ means a proposed transfer
would result in another, existing water right not receiving
previously available water to which it is legally entitled.”
Applying that definition of injury, the director found that
the senior in-stream water right on Drift Creek—Certificate
72591—would not be injured by the proposed use, because
the draft permit specifically provided that East Valley was
permitted to use water “only at times when sufficient water
is available to satisfy all prior rights.” For the same reason,
the director concluded that the protestants had not rebutted
the presumption that the proposed use was in the public
interest, because none of the public interest considerations
set out in ORS 537.170(8) weighed against approval of the
application. Importantly, as relevant here, the director con-
cluded that the protestants had not shown by a preponder-
ance of the evidence that the proposed use would impair or
be detrimental to “vested and inchoate rights to the waters
of this state or to the use of the waters of this state, and the
means necessary to protect such rights,” ORS 537.170(8)(f),
because the prior appropriation system worked to protect
162      East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

the water rights that Certificate 72591 guaranteed: Under
that system, East Valley would not be permitted to store
water until all senior water rights were satisfied.
         The protestants filed exceptions to the director’s
final order with the commission under ORS 537.173. They
argued (1) that the proposed use would not protect the
in-stream water rights within Drift Creek as guaranteed by
Certificate 72591, because that certificate requires that the
protected flows be maintained throughout the 11-mile reach
of the in-stream water right and not merely at the mouth
of Drift Creek, and (2) that the proposed new appropriation
would inundate an in-stream water right and thereby frus-
trate the beneficial purpose of that existing vested right.
         Agreeing with the protestants’ second exception, the
commission issued a final order reversing the director’s order
and rejecting East Valley’s application, reasoning that the pro-
posed use would impair or be detrimental to the public inter-
est and that no modifications would allow the proposed use to
comport with the public interest so as to allow for approval.
As we will discuss in more detail below, the commission
agreed with the director that East Valley was entitled to the
presumption that the proposed use was in the public interest,
based on findings that (1) the use was permissible, (2) water
was available, (3) the proposed use would not injure other
water rights, and (4) the proposed use complied with commis-
sion rules. The commission concluded, however, that the prot-
estants had overcome that presumption by demonstrating,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that East Valley’s water
storage project would frustrate the beneficial purpose of an
existing water right—Certificate 72591—namely, to provide
habitat for cutthroat trout. The commission then conducted
the review that it understood ORS 537.170(8) to require under
the circumstances, and it concluded that the seniority of the
in-stream right would not alone protect the purpose of that
right. The commission explained:
   “Where an existing water right and a proposed new use
   are both diverted out of the stream for consumptive use,
   a senior priority date will protect the senior water right
   because a junior appropriator is prohibited from divert-
   ing water unless and until senior right water rights are
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                     163

    met. However, where a proposed reservoir will inundate
    a stream reach protected by an existing in-stream water
    right, additional scrutiny is required to determine whether
    there exist conditions that may provide the means nec-
    essary to protect the beneficial purpose of the in-stream
    water right.”
Upon applying that additional scrutiny, the commission
determined that inundation of Drift Creek would frus-
trate the beneficial purpose of the in-stream water rights
conferred by Certificate 72591 and that the record did not
establish that there existed the means necessary to protect
those in-stream rights.16 It therefore denied East Valley’s
application for a permit.
          East Valley sought judicial review in the Court of
Appeals, and, as noted, that court affirmed the commis-
sion’s final order. East Valley Water, 328 Or App 790.
                              II. ANALYSIS
         On review, East Valley contends that, in affirming
the commission’s final order, the Court of Appeals misinter-
preted the applicable statutes in two ways. First, it argues,
the Court of Appeals misinterpreted ORS 537.170(8)(f)
—which requires consideration of all “vested and incho-
ate” water rights and “the means necessary to protect such
rights”—as protecting something other than the senior
water-right holder’s entitlement to a certain quantity of
water as measured at a certain location. According to East
Valley, in expressly making that consideration part of the
commission’s assessment of whether a proposed use would
be in the public interest, the legislature intended merely to
codify the well-established principle of “prior appropriation”
and thereby ensure that the certificated quantity of water
is present at the measurement point identified in the certif-
icate—in this case, at the mouth of Drift Creek. East Valley
argues that the legislature did not intend ORS 537.170(8)(f)
    16
       In so doing, the commission emphasized that it did not intend its decision in
this case to suggest that, in all cases, inundation of an in-stream water right will
frustrate the purpose of an existing in-stream water right. The commission stated
that, in a different case, with a different in-stream water right and a different
record, the commission may determine that conditions could be fashioned to pro-
tect existing in-stream water rights within the inundated area, and that, under
those circumstances, the commission might well arrive at a different conclusion.
164        East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

to permit the commission to consider anything other than
water quantity—including whether the beneficial purpose
of a senior water right would be frustrated by the proposed
use—in determining whether the proposed use was in the
public interest.
         Second, and alternatively, East Valley argues that
the Court of Appeals misinterpreted the requirements
of ORS 537.153 and ORS 537.170(8) in denying its permit
application. According to East Valley, once the rebuttable
presumption of public interest has arisen, ORS 537.153 and
ORS 537.170 require the commission to “consider” all of
the public interest factors—and balance them against one
another—to determine whether the presumption has been
overcome. At a minimum, East Valley contends, the com-
mission was required to consider all seven public interest
factors before making its final determination under ORS
537.170(8) whether the proposed use was in the public inter-
est. East Valley asserts that the commission relied on only
one of the public interest factors—ORS 537.170(8)(f)—in
reaching both decisions; it argues that, for that separate
reason, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the commis-
sion’s order.
         East Valley’s first argument, and, in part, its second
argument, present issues of statutory construction, which
we resolve by applying the familiar methodology set out in
State v. Gaines, 346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009),
through which we attempt to discern the intent of the legis-
lature that enacted the statutory provisions at issue by con-
sidering their text and context, together with any legislative
history that we find helpful.
         We begin by observing that no party challenges
the director’s factual findings, which the commission’s final
order adopted and incorporated by reference in their entirety.
Accordingly, we accept those findings of fact for purposes of
this opinion. In addition, the parties do not challenge the
commission’s determination that, under ORS 537.153(2), the
rebuttable presumption that the proposed use is in the pub-
lic interest arose here.17 As explained above, that determi-
   17
      In the Court of Appeals, WaterWatch did challenge that determination,
arguing that “injur[y]” to a water right within the meaning of ORS 537.153(2)
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                 165

nation was based on the commission’s findings, under ORS
537.153(2), that (1) the proposed use was permissible; (2)
water was available; (3) the proposed use would not injure
other water rights; and (4) the proposed use complied with
the commission’s rules. We therefore also accept, for pur-
poses of this opinion, that the rebuttable presumption set
out in ORS 537.153(2) applies. Doing so necessarily means
that we assume, for purposes of this opinion, that a senior
water-right holder is “injure[d]” within the meaning of ORS
537.153(2) only if the senior water-right holder would not
receive the quantity of water to which it is legally entitled
under a certificate.
A. The Public Interest Protected by ORS 537.170(8)(f)
         East Valley’s statutory arguments both are ulti-
mately directed at the commission’s reliance on ORS
537.170(8)(f). As noted, East Valley first contends that the
commission erroneously interpreted that paragraph as pro-
tecting the specific use underlying a water right, and not
just the quantity of water to which a right holder is enti-
tled. Second—and alternatively—East Valley argues that,
to the extent that ORS 537.170(8)(f) does protect such uses,
the commission erred in relying solely on that provision to
support (1) its conclusion that the public interest presump-
tion had been rebutted, (2) its final determination that East
Valley’s proposed use would impair or be detrimental to
the public interest, or (3) both. We begin with East Valley’s
argument that ORS 537.170(8)(f) does not protect the use for
which a water right has been granted.
         The public interest reflected in ORS 537.170(8)(f)
first comes into play through ORS 537.153(2), which, among
other things, establishes the conditions that give rise to a
rebuttable presumption that a proposed use is in the pub-
lic interest and lists ways in which that presumption may
be overcome. As relevant here, under ORS 537.153(2), the
public interest presumption can be overcome by a prepon-
derance of evidence that either:

means more than merely insufficient water to satisfy existing water rights. The
Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to reach that argument. East Valley Water,
328 Or App at 793 n 2. WaterWatch does not renew that argument in its brief to
this court, and we do not address it in this opinion.
166       East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

      “(a) One or more of the criteria for establishing the
   presumption are not satisfied; or
      “(b) The proposed use will impair or be detrimental to
   the public interest as demonstrated in comments, in a pro-
   test under subsection (6) of this section[,] or in a finding of
   the department that shows:
      “(A) The specific public interest under ORS 537.170(8)
   that would be impaired or detrimentally affected; and
     “(B) Specifically how the identified public interest
   would be impaired or detrimentally affected.”
(Emphasis added.) As discussed, both the commission and
the Court of Appeals agreed with the protestants that the
public interest set out in ORS 537.170(8)(f)—the public inter-
est in “[a]ll vested and inchoate rights to the waters of this
state or to the use of the waters of this state, and the means
necessary to protect such rights”—would be impaired or det-
rimentally affected by the proposed use because, as the com-
mission explained, “[i]nsofar as the in-stream water right is
for the purpose of providing the specified flows to support
specific cutthroat trout life stages, inundation appears to
defeat the beneficial purpose of the existing water right.”
See also East Valley, 328 Or App at 806 (concluding it
unlikely that the legislature “intended that a junior water
right would be permitted to frustrate the actual purpose
and use of a senior water right”). East Valley contends that
that conclusion applies an incorrect understanding of ORS
537.170(8)(f). It argues that ORS 537.170(8)(f) protects only
the senior water-right holder’s right to the quantity of water
set out in the certificate, as measured at the location identi-
fied in the certificate. As East Valley explained at oral argu-
ment in this court, in its view, the effect of a proposed use
on a certificate holder’s beneficial use of water is immaterial
if there is no adverse impact on the quantity of water that
reaches the measuring point.
      1. Attributes of a vested water right in general
        To determine what is required to demonstrate
whether and, if so, how the public interest set out in ORS
537.170(8)(f) would be impaired or detrimentally affected by
a proposed use, we must first determine the nature of the
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                      167

interest protected by that paragraph. Before doing so, how-
ever, it is helpful to review, more generally, the attributes of
a vested water right. As this court stated in Fort Vannoy:
   “ ‘The elements of an appropriation of water * * * are: (a)
   Quantity of water appropriated; (b) time, period, or sea-
   son when the right to the use exists; (c) the place upon
   the stream at which the right of diversion attaches; (d) the
   nature of the use or the purpose to which the right of use
   applies, such as irrigation, domestic use, culinary use, com-
   mercial use, or otherwise; (e) the place where the right of
   use may be applied; [and] (f) the priority date of appropria-
   tion or right as related to other rights and priorities.’ ”
345 Or at 79-80 (quoting Tudor v. Jaca et al., 
178 Or 126,142-43, 164 P2d 680 (1945) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted; emphasis added)). Thus, a water right is a right to use
a certain quantity of water, but, as the emphasized text
makes clear, the nature or purpose of the use of the water
is a distinct, integral aspect of a water right. That concept
is reflected most clearly in ORS 540.610(1), which provides
that “beneficial use” is the “basis, the measure and the limit
of all rights to use of water” in the state. As the court stated
in Fort Vannoy, beneficial use “is the foundation of an appro-
priative right.” 345 Or at 87.
         Other water rights statutes similarly reflect the cen-
tral role that beneficial use plays under the prior appropri-
ation doctrine. As we have explained, under that doctrine,
beneficial use “is essential to the acquisition and mainte-
nance of certificated water rights.” Id. The Water Rights
Act codifies that principle. For example, by requiring the
department to approve all applications made in proper form
that contemplate applying water to beneficial uses (and do
not conflict with existing rights), ORS 537.160(1) effectively
conditions the issuance of a certificate on the appropriated
water having a beneficial use. Similarly, ORS 537.250(1)
provides that, when an appropriation has been perfected
in accordance with the act, the department “shall issue to
the applicant a certificate of the same character as that
described in ORS 539.140.” ORS 539.140, in turn, provides,
in relevant part:
168      East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

   “Upon the final determination of the rights to the waters of
   any stream, the Water Resources Department shall issue
   to each person represented in the determination a certifi-
   cate setting forth the name and post-office address of the
   owner of the right; the priority of the date, extent and pur-
   pose of the right, and if the water is for irrigation purposes,
   a description of the legal subdivisions of land to which the
   water is appurtenant.”
(Emphasis added.)
         In addition, ORS 537.120 provides:
   “Subject to existing rights, and except as otherwise pro-
   vided in ORS chapter 538, all waters within the state may
   be appropriated for beneficial use, as provided in the Water
   Rights Act and not otherwise; but nothing contained in the
   Water Rights Act shall be so construed as to take away or
   impair the vested right of any person to any water or to the
   use of any water.”
(Emphasis added.) The previous version of that statute was
part of the original 1909 Water Code. Or Laws 1909, ch 216,
§ 1. As enacted in 1909, the wording of that statute was
similar to today’s wording, but it did not include the specific
protection for the vested right to “the use” of the water. The
statute originally read as follows:
   “Subject to existing rights, all waters within the state may
   be appropriated for beneficial use, as herein provided, and
   not otherwise; but nothing herein contained shall be so con-
   strued as to take away or impair the vested right of any per-
   son, firm, corporation, or association, to any water.”
Lord’s Oregon Laws, title XLII, ch VI, § 6594 (1910) (empha-
sis added). The statutory wording remained essentially
unchanged until 1945, when the words “or to the use of any
water” were added. Or Laws 1945, ch 58, § 1. We are aware
of no legislative history explaining the legislature’s decision
to add that phrase to the statute, but the legislature’s deci-
sion to add a second, differently worded phrase suggests that
it meant for ORS 537.120 to protect two distinct attributes
of a vested water right. Marshall v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLP, 371 Or 536, 555, 539 P3d 766 (2023) (in the absence
of contrary evidence of legislative intent, “we generally
assume that when the legislature uses different terms—at
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                       169

least in the same statute—it intend[s] different meanings”).
And that, in turn, suggests that, since at least the middle of
the last century, the right to appropriate water for a benefi-
cial use has been understood to be subject to not only senior
vested rights to a specific quantity of water, but also to any
such right to use that water for a specific beneficial purpose.
          Importantly, it has long been understood under
both the common law and the water-rights statutes that a
water right does not entitle a holder to use a given quantity
of water for just any beneficial use; rather, it is the right
to use water in the manner set out in the application and
determined to be beneficial by the department or commis-
sion. ORS 537.250(3) (providing that “[r]ights to the use of
water acquired under the provisions of the Water Rights
Act, as set forth in a certificate issued under this section,
shall continue in the owner thereof so long as the water shall
be applied to a beneficial use under and in accordance with
the terms of the certificate,” subject only to loss by, among
other things, nonuse); ORS 537.120 (“all waters within the
state may be appropriated for beneficial use, as provided in
the Water Rights Act and not otherwise”); Teel Irrigation
Dist., 323 Or at 668 (“The certificate represents a vested,
perfected water right that continues so long as the water is
applied to a beneficial use in accordance with the terms of
the certificate, subject to loss by nonuse and other events.”).
Indeed, if water-rights holders wish to change the use they
intend to make of the water, they must apply to the depart-
ment for a water-rights transfer. ORS 540.520(1)(a) (so pro-
viding). Using water for some purpose other than the pur-
pose set out in the relevant permit or certificate can lead to
forfeiture of the water right. ORS 540.610(1), (2); Rencken v.
Young, 300 Or 352, 364, 711 P2d 954 (1985) (cancelling cer-
tificate conferring right to use water from March to October
because, for five consecutive years, certificate holder did
not use water during those months; use of water during
November months did not forestall forfeiture, because that
was not the certificated use).18

     18
        It follows that, if a proposed use were to preclude a senior water-right hold-
er’s beneficial use of the water under a certificate and the nonuse continued for
five or more consecutive years, the senior holder would risk forfeiting the vested
water right.
170      East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

         In that regard, the beneficial “use” underlying a
water right could be viewed as a limitation on the right hold-
er’s own application of the water it appropriates, rather than
something entitled to its own protection. As the foregoing
discussion indicates, however, even though the specific des-
ignation of what water uses are allowed may impose such
limitations, that does not mean that the specified use is not
also entitled to protection against subsequent appropriators
and their uses of the water. Indeed, that understanding is
reflected in at least two United States Supreme Court opin-
ions, including one predating the enactment of the Water
Rights Act. In Atchison v. Peterson, 87 US (20 Wall) 507, 
22L Ed 414 (1874), the Supreme Court stated, “The right to
water by prior appropriation * * * is limited in every case,
in quantity and quality, by the uses for which the appro-
priation is made.” Id. at 514. The Court explained that the
senior water-right holder has the right to insist that not only
the amount, but also the quality, of the water should not be
impaired so as to defeat the purpose of the appropriation. Id.The Court stated:
   “What diminution of quantity, or deterioration in quality,
   will constitute an invasion of the rights of the first appro-
   priator will depend upon the special circumstances of each
   case, considered with reference to the uses to which the
   water is applied. A slight deterioration in quality might
   render the water unfit for drink or domestic purposes,
   whilst it would not sensibly impair its value for mining or
   irrigation. In all controversies, therefore, between him and
   parties subsequently claiming the water, the question for
   determination is necessarily whether his use and enjoy-
   ment of the water to the extent of his original appropriation
   have been impaired by the acts of the defendant.”
Id. at 514-15.
         In Atchison, the Court applied that principle but
concluded that the deterioration in the quality of the water
available to the senior water-right holder was very slight
and did “not render the water to any appreciable extent less
useful.” Id. at 516. The Court reached a different result in
Arizona Copper Co. v. Gillespie, 230 US 46, 33 S Ct 1004, 
57L Ed 1384 (1913). In that case, the downstream water-right
holder had been using water from the Gila River for irrigation
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                   171

for about 40 years. Id. at 52. Some 25 miles upstream, a
mining company enlarged its copper ore treatment facility
and permitted its waste material to enter small tributaries
of the Gila River, which carried the waste downstream and
polluted the water that the senior right holder used for irri-
gation. Id. In holding that the mining company’s river-pol-
luting activities could be enjoined, the Court observed that
“[t]here is no question about the quantity of water appropri-
ated by the upper user, the objection being that the quality
of the water which comes down to the lower proprietor after
it is used by the copper company is no longer fit for irrigation
purposes.” Id. at 55. That is, although the mining activities
had no effect on the quantity of water available for the senior
right holder’s use, by impairing the beneficial use for which
the water had been appropriated, those activities interfered
with interests protected as part of the senior holder’s water
rights.
         Atchison and Arizona Copper Co. thus indicate that
the doctrine of prior appropriation has historically protected
more than just the quantity of water to which a senior water-
right holder is entitled; it has also protected the senior
holder’s right to use the water in a particular way, so as to
prohibit subsequent appropriations that interfere with that
use. That historical context suggests to us that, even long
before it added explicit provisions to the Water Rights Act
protecting the right “to the use of” water, the legislature
would have understood the beneficial use for which water
had previously been appropriated to be entitled to protection
alongside the specific quantity of water that a water-right
certificate guaranteed.
    2. ORS 537.170(8)(f) specifically
         With that understanding of the scope of water
rights generally, we turn to the specific question of how ORS
537.170(8)(f) works to protect those rights. We begin with
the text of that paragraph, which, as noted, requires con-
sideration of “[a]ll vested and inchoate rights to the waters
of this state or to the use of the waters of this state, and the
means necessary to protect such rights.” (Emphasis added.)
As the emphasized text indicates, the public interest factor
in paragraph (8)(f) references not only senior rights to water,
172      East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

but, separately, rights to “the use” of that water. And, as with
ORS 537.120, the legislature’s purposeful reference to both
“the waters of this state” and “the use of the waters of this
state” suggests that it intended that paragraph to protect
two different attributes of a vested water right: the right to
both (1) a particular quantity of water and (2) a particular
use, namely, the beneficial use identified in the certificate.
          The statutory context further suggests that the
public interest can lie in protecting the beneficial purpose
of a water right in addition to ensuring its availability. At
least one of the other public interest factors listed in ORS
537.170(8) strongly indicates that the legislature intended to
protect more than just quantities of water. Paragraph (8)(a)
requires the director or commissioner to consider the pub-
lic’s interest in “[c]onserving the highest use of the water
for all purposes,” including, among other things, the use of
water for “public recreation” and “scenic attraction,” ORS
537.170(8)(a), which may at times not be solely tied to water
quantity. For example, permitting the construction of a res-
ervoir that would leave unusable mudflats exposed for part
of the year might conflict with the public interest in main-
taining a stream’s scenic appeal, whether or not it reduced
the quantity of water available at a particular place or time.
By making such conflicts an appropriate consideration when
reviewing water-rights applications, the legislature appears
to have made protecting permitted water uses a separate
consideration additional—if necessarily related—to water
quantity.
         ORS 537.153(2) provides additional contextual sup-
port for that understanding, because we generally construe
statutes so as to give effect, if possible, to all their provi-
sions. See ORS 174.010 (requiring that approach). As we have
explained, that provision creates a rebuttable presumption
that a proposed use will not impair or be detrimental to the
public interest if, among other things, “the proposed use will
not injure other water rights.” And here the parties agree
that a proposed use would “injure” other water rights under
ORS 537.153(2) if the use would deprive other right holders
of quantities of water to which they are entitled. Assuming
for present purposes that the parties’ understanding of
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                   173

“injure” is correct, that meaning further suggests that ORS
537.170(8)(f) protects more than just water quantities. That
is, although the presumption under ORS 537.153(2) can be
overcome by a showing that the proposed use will, in fact,
“injure” other water rights, see ORS 537.153(2)(a) (stating
that the presumption is overcome if “[o]ne or more of the cri-
teria for establishing the presumption are not satisfied”), it
separately can be overcome under ORS 537.153(2)(b)(A) by
a showing that “[t]he proposed use will impair or be detri-
mental to the public interest” based on at least one of the
considerations listed under ORS 537.170(8). Because the
presumption would already have been overcome under ORS
537.153(2)(a) if a proposed use would reduce the quantity of
water available to another water-right holder, interpreting
ORS 537.170(8)(f) as protecting only water quantities would
effectively render that provision meaningless. In other words,
if, as East Valley would have it, the consideration of “[a]ll
vested and inchoate rights to the waters of this state or to the
use of the waters of this state” applies only when a proposed
use would deny a senior water-right holder the amount of
water due, that consideration would be unnecessary, because
that “injur[y]” would already have overcome the presump-
tion of public interest under ORS 537.153(2)(a). In our view,
it is unlikely that the legislature intended to limit the scope
of ORS 537.170(8)(f) so as to render that provision largely
superfluous. See State ex rel Torres-Lopez v. Fahrion, 
373 Or816, 832, __ P3d __ (2025) (describing the court’s “surplusage
principle,” whereby the court seeks to avoid statutory inter-
pretations that would lead to redundancy).
          We turn to whether any legislative history sheds light
on the legislative intent behind ORS 537.170(8)(f). The par-
ties have not identified any legislative history specific to that
point, nor have we found any. However, the enactment history
of that paragraph shows that it was added to ORS 537.170 as
part of a wide-ranging amendment to ORS chapter 537, which
was designed to create a “coordinated, integrated state water
resource policy” to be carried out by a single state agency,
the State Water Resources Board. Or Laws 1955, ch 707,
§ 1(2), § 2(1). As part of that effort, the legislature amended
ORS 537.170 to add four additional public interest consider-
ations relevant to whether a proposed use would impair or be
174         East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

detrimental to the public interest.19 Or Laws 1955, ch 707, § 36.
Among them was what is now codified as ORS 537.170(8)(f):
“All vested and inchoate rights to the waters of this state or
to the use thereof, and the means necessary to protect those
rights.” Id.; former ORS 537.170(2)(f) (1955).20
         The statutory history does not reveal any particu-
lar reason for adding paragraph (8)(f) to the list of public
interest considerations. East Valley argues, however, that,
on the whole, the enactment history of the 1955 amendments
to the Water Rights Act and, specifically, the enactment of
ORS 537.170(8)(f), demonstrate that the legislature intended
for ORS 537.170(8)(f) to protect only rights to water quanti-
ties, and not rights to the specific uses to which the water
was to be put. East Valley recognizes that paragraph (8)(f)
protects existing water rights “to the full extent reflected on
a water-right permit or certificate and protected by the prior
appropriation system,” but, in East Valley’s view, the water
rights “reflected” and “protected” in that regard are rights
to the specific quantities of water stated in each certificate,
as measured at specific locations. That argument, however,
overlooks the fact that a water-right certificate expressly
confers both a right to water and a right to the beneficial
use of that water. East Valley has not identified anything
underlying the adoption of ORS 537.170(8)(f) that suggests
that, by codifying existing principles of prior appropriation
in the Water Rights Act and its amendments, the legisla-
ture intended for that paragraph to protect the rights that
holders had to specific quantities of water while disregarding
how that water was being used.
         To summarize, a water right confers not just the
right to a quantity of water, but also the right to continue

    19
       Prior to the 1955 amendments, former ORS 537.170(2) (1953) set out only
two public interest considerations: “conserving the highest use of the water for
all purposes, including irrigation, domestic use, municipal water supply, power
development, public recreation, protection of commercial and game fishing or any
other beneficial use to which the water may be applied for which it may have
a special value to the public,” and “the maximum economic development of the
waters involved.” Those two public interest factors remain in the current statute
as ORS 537.170(8)(a) and (b).
    20
       The legislature amended the wording of the public interest factor in para-
graph (8)(f) to change “the use thereof” to “of the use of the waters of this state”
in 1985. Or Laws 1985, ch 673, § 30.
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                       175

the specified beneficial use of that water. In other words, the
nature or purpose of the use stated in a water-right certifi-
cate is a distinct, integral aspect of a water right entitled to
protection. Thus, in making “[a]ll vested and inchoate rights
to the waters of this state or to the use of the waters of this
state” a factor to be considered in determining the public
interest, the legislature implicitly recognized the need to
protect both of those rights and expressly required the direc-
tor or the commission to consider them both before making a
final decision whether to issue a new water-right certificate.
The commission did that here and, based upon that consid-
eration, determined that the use proposed by East Valley
would impair or detrimentally affect the specific use under-
lying Certificate 72591. Because that was an appropriate
consideration, it follows that the Court of Appeals did not err
in affirming the commission’s reliance on ORS 537.170(8)(f)
to conclude that the rebuttable presumption that East
Valley’s proposed water use was in the public interest had
been overcome because that use would frustrate the benefi-
cial purpose of a senior water right.
B.    Requirements For Denying Application After Commission
      Concludes that Rebuttable Presumption of Public Interest
      Under ORS 537.530(2) Has Been Overcome
         East Valley alternatively argues that the Court of
Appeals erred in failing to recognize that the commission
was required to consider all seven public interest factors
listed in ORS 537.170(8)(a) to (g)—balancing them against
one another—before determining that the proposed use
was not in the public interest.21 As noted, East Valley’s first
alternative argument is that the commission was required
to engage in that balancing even before it could determine

     21
        As we will explain, consideration of those factors is triggered by two differ-
ent provisions: First, it is triggered indirectly under ORS 537.153(2), which pro-
vides that the presumption of public interest can be overcome if a preponderance
of the evidence shows that one or more of the seven public interest factors would
be adversely affected by a proposed use. Second, it is triggered directly, under
ORS 537.170(8), which provides:
     “If the presumption of public interest under ORS 537.153(2) is overcome, then
     before issuing a final order, the director or the commission * * * shall make
     the final determination of whether the proposed use * * * would impair or be
     detrimental to the public interest by considering [the seven factors listed in
     ORS 537.170(8)(a) to (g)].”
176         East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

that the presumption of public interest had been rebutted
under ORS 537.153(2) (providing various ways in which the
presumption may be overcome). But perhaps recognizing
that the clear text of ORS 537.153(2)(b)(A) strongly suggests
otherwise, East Valley appears to put more weight on its
second alternative argument: that, even if the commission
could rely on a single public interest factor in determining
that the presumption of public interest had been overcome,
the commission was required to consider all seven public
interest factors listed under ORS 537.170(8) before making
its final determination that East Valley’s proposed use was
not in the public interest.
          Respondents acknowledge that, in its final order
denying East Valley’s application, the commission did not
expressly discuss any public interest consideration other
than ORS 537.170(8)(f). Respondents argue, however, that,
as the commission itself concluded, it was not required to
consider the other public interest factors unless it intended
to grant East Valley’s application despite its determination
that the presumption of public interest had been overcome.22
Here, respondents argue, because the commission properly
denied East Valley’s application based on ORS 537.170(8)(f)
and did not intend to grant East Valley’s application, it
was not required to consider any of the other listed factors.
Respondents alternatively argue that, if this court were
to conclude that ORS 537.170(8) required the commission
to consider the other listed factors before making its final
determination, then the court should deem the commission
to have done so by adopting, in their entirety, the director’s
factual findings, which did expressly discuss each of the pub-
lic interest factors listed under ORS 537.170(8). As we will
explain, we conclude that, upon determining that the public
interest presumption had been overcome, the commission
was then required by ORS 537.170(8) to consider all seven
of the public interest factors listed in that subsection before
making its final determination that East Valley’s proposed
use would impair or be detrimental to the public interest.
    22
       As we discuss in greater detail below, the commission relied for that pur-
pose on a commission rule, OAR 690-310-0120(5), which requires the department
or commission to make specific findings regarding the public interest factors if it
intends to issue a permit after determining that the presumption of public inter-
est has been overcome. 374 Or at 180-81.
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                      177

We further conclude that neither the record nor the commis-
sion’s final order itself can support the contention that the
commission implicitly considered all seven factors when it
adopted the director’s factual findings. Thus, the Court of
Appeals erred in affirming the commission’s order.
         We begin by observing that East Valley’s first argu-
ment—that the commission was required to consider all
seven public interest factors before concluding that the pub-
lic interest presumption had been rebutted—requires little
discussion. In our view, that argument is effectively fore-
closed by the plain language of ORS 537.153(2), which indi-
cates that the rebuttable presumption may be overcome by
a showing that the proposed use would have a detrimental
effect on a single public interest listed under ORS 537.180(8):
      “[The] rebuttable presumption * * * may be overcome by
   a preponderance of evidence that * * *
      “* * * * *
      “(b) The proposed use will impair or be detrimental to
   the public interest as demonstrated * * * in a finding of the
   department that shows:
      “(A) The specific public interest under ORS 537.170(8)
   that would be impaired or detrimentally affected; and
     “(B) Specifically how the identified public interest
   would be impaired or detrimentally affected.”
(Emphases added.) Both subparagraphs (A) and (B) use the
definite article “the” in reference to “the” public interest
listed under ORS 537.170(8) that the commission might rely
on in determining that the presumption has been overcome.
Similarly, each of those provisions also uses the singular
“public interest” in reference to individual items on that list,
and subparagraph (B) makes the point even clearer by ref-
erencing “the identified public interest.” (Emphasis added.)
Each of those legislative choices strongly suggests to us that
the commission may rely on a single public interest factor
when concluding that the public interest presumption has
been rebutted, and nothing in the text, context, or legisla-
tive history of ORS 537.153(2) can support interpreting that
provision to require that the commission consider—much
less balance—more than one public interest factor at that

stage of its review. See State ex rel. Rosenblum v. Nisley, 
367Or 78, 83, 473 P3d 46 (2020) (because the words of a stat-
ute are the best evidence of the legislature’s intent, we give
“primary weight to the [statute’s] text and context”); see also
ORS 174.010 (courts may not add to statutes content omitted
by legislature). Thus, we are not persuaded by that aspect of
East Valley’s argument.
         East Valley’s second alternative argument, how-
ever, warrants greater consideration. East Valley contends
that, at a minimum, once the commission determined that
the presumption of public interest had been overcome, it was
then required by ORS 537.170(8) to consider all seven of the
public interest factors set out in that subsection and balance
them against one another before making its final determi-
nation of whether the proposed use would be in the public
interest. According to East Valley, because the commission
never engaged in that broader inquiry, it erred in ultimately
concluding that the proposed use would not be in the pub-
lic interest and in denying East Valley’s application on that
basis. Here we agree with East Valley.
           ORS 537.170(8) provides:
       “If the presumption of public interest under ORS
    537.153(2) is overcome, then before issuing a final order,
    the director or the commission, if applicable, shall make
    the final determination of whether the proposed use or the
    proposed use as modified in the proposed final order would
    impair or be detrimental to the public interest by consider-
    ing [the seven listed public interest factors].”
The Court of Appeals appears to have agreed with the
commission’s understanding that, because the commission
did not intend to grant East Valley’s application, it was
not required to consider any of the public interest factors
other than ORS 537.170(8)(f), the factor that it relied on in
determining that the public interest presumption had been
overcome. East Valley Water, 328 Or App at 807.23 Here, in

        The Court of Appeals observed that a commission rule, OAR 690-310-
0120(5), requires the commission to make specific findings demonstrating its con-
sideration of all seven public interest factors before an application may be granted
in a case in which the public interest presumption has been overcome. East Valley
Water, 328 Or App at 807 n 13. On its face, OAR 690-310-0120(5) requires the
commission to deny a permit unless it makes those findings, and, unlike ORS
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                  179

contrast to East Valley’s previous argument, the plain stat-
utory text strongly supports East Valley’s view that the com-
mission was required to consider all seven public interest
factors, and respondents do not seriously contend otherwise.
          The text of ORS 537.170(8) contemplates a two-step
process. The first clause of that section—“If the presump-
tion of public interest under ORS 537.153(2) is overcome”—
reflects the first step (which occurs under ORS 537.153(2)), in
which the presumption may be overcome due to a proposed
use’s adverse effect on one of the public interest factors listed
in ORS 537.170(8). The second clause—”then before issuing
a final order” (emphasis added)—announces the second
step, which occurs after the presumption has been rebutted
and has separate procedural requirements. ORS 537.170(8).
And in describing that second step, the statute expressly
requires the director or commission to “make the final deter-
mination of whether the proposed use or the proposed use
as modified in the proposed final order would impair or be
detrimental to the public interest by considering” the seven
listed public interest factors that follow—paragraphs (8)(a)
through (g). Id. (emphases added).
         Respondents urge us to adopt what they under-
stand to be the Court of Appeals’ rationale: that, because
the commission did not grant East Valley’s application, the
commission was not required to consider the public interest
factors any further. However, respondents make no effort to
support that conclusion based on the text of ORS 537.170(8)
or any other statutory provision, nor can we conceive of any
viable argument that a statutory directive to consider seven
factors does not, in fact, require that consideration. Instead,
respondents contend that, if this court concludes that the
commission was required to consider the other public fac-
tors before issuing its final order, then we should deem it
to have fulfilled that obligation by adopting the director’s

537.170(8), that rule does not explicitly require the commission to further con-
sider the public interest factors before issuing a denial. Although the Court of
Appeals did not explain its reliance on OAR 690-310-0120(5), we observe that it
could not have reasoned that the commission’s rule somehow superseded its stat-
utory obligations under ORS 537.170(8), as it could not have had that effect. See
Torres-Lopez, 373 Or at 834 n 14 (“To the extent that * * * administrative rules
conflict with [a statute], the statute controls.”).
180      East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

factual findings, which did consider the other factors. We
disagree.
         Respondents are correct that, in initially approving
East Valley’s water-right application, the director expressly
considered each of the public interest factors under ORS
537.170(8). But respondents’ argument—that, by adopting
the director’s findings, the commission satisfied its own
obligation to consider those factors—has two flaws. One is
that the director’s final order uniformly determined that the
public factor considerations favored granting East Valley’s
application. If, in fact, the commission had adopted those
findings in support of rejecting the application with no
explanation, then that might well have raised questions as
to whether the commission’s final order was supported by
substantial evidence and reason, as East Valley has sepa-
rately argued.
         We need not decide that issue, however, due to the
second, more significant flaw: In its final order denying East
Valley’s application, the commission expressly disavowed
any need to consider the remaining factors. The final order
acknowledges the list of factors under ORS 537.170(8) that
must be considered, but it describes the obligation to con-
sider them as arising only under limited circumstances,
namely,
   “if, after a protest is filed, the Department or Commission
   determines that the presumption is overcome but that the
   permit should, notwithstanding that determination, be
   issued because it will not impair or be detrimental to the
   public interest[.]”
Here, of course, the commission determined that the permit
should not be issued. And as to that circumstance, the final
order made clear that the commission did not understand
there to be any obligation to consider the remaining public
interest factors. Citing OAR 690-310-0120(5), the final order
states:
      “If, after a protest is filed, the Department or the
   Commission determines that the application should
   be denied because the presumption is overcome, the
   Department or the Commission need not consider the
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                       181

    factors in ORS 537.170(8) to determine whether the pro-
    posed use should nonetheless be allowed.”
(Emphasis added.) Following that statement, the final order
never mentions any of the ORS 537.170(8) public interest fac-
tors—or the director’s discussion of them—other than ORS
537.170(8)(f). The final order discusses that paragraph at
considerable length, but exclusively in connection with the
commission’s conclusions that the public interest presump-
tion had been rebutted and that no modifications would
allow the proposed use to comport with the public interest
so as to allow for its approval.
          The commission’s express disavowal of any need to
consider the remaining public interest factors, together with
the final order’s omission of any reference to them or to the
director’s related findings in the order’s “Analysis” section,
is simply irreconcilable with respondents’ contention that
the commission implicitly considered those factors in mak-
ing its final determination of whether East Valley’s proposed
use would impair or be detrimental to the public interest.
Rather, we view the only reasonable understanding of the
final order to be that the commission did not interpret ORS
537.170(8) to require it to consider the other factors, and so
it did not do so here. As a result, the commission’s final order
reflects an erroneous interpretation of law, and, accordingly,
the Court of Appeals erred in affirming that order.24
         Given our conclusion that the commission acted
under an erroneous interpretation of law, the appropriate
disposition is to remand this case for further action, where
the commission will presumably consider the required fac-
tors in the first instance. See ORS 183.482(8)(a)(B) (per-
mitting court to remand erroneous order for further action

     24
        In his dissenting opinion, Justice Bushong reaches the opposite conclu-
sion—that the commission implicitly considered all seven public interest factors
before making its final determination. 374 Or at 186-87 (Bushong, J., dissenting).
In Justice Bushong’s view, the commission’s statement that it “need not consider”
the other factors simply meant that it “need not consider them again.” Id. (empha-
sis in original). For the reasons set forth in the text, we respectfully disagree
with that understanding of the final order. For similar reasons, we disagree with
the dissent’s view that the error that this opinion finds is simply that the commis-
sion failed to expressly state that it was considering the other factors. Id. (slip op
at 6). The error that we find is that the commission did not consider those factors,
not that it merely failed to expressly state that it was doing so.

under correct interpretation of the law). That, in our view,
obviates the need to consider East Valley’s argument that,
to “consider” the public interest factors as required under
ORS 537.170(8), the commission must “balance” those con-
siderations against one another before reaching its final
determination whether to grant East Valley’s application.
To the extent that the commission or other participants dis-
pute the district’s contention that “consider[ation]” under
ORS 537.170(8) requires the commission to balance the vari-
ous public interest factors, the parties are free to make their
competing arguments to the commission on remand.25
                          III.    CONCLUSION
         We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred, in
part, in affirming the commission’s final order in this case.
That court—and the commission—did not err when they
interpreted the statutorily recognized public interest in
“vested and inchoate” water rights and “the means neces-
sary to protect such rights” as protecting both the quantity
of water guaranteed to a senior water-right holder and the
beneficial use associated with those rights. Thus, the com-
mission did not err in relying on a finding that the beneficial
purpose of a senior water right would be frustrated by the
proposed use in determining that the public interest pre-
sumption had been rebutted. However, the commission did
err when it interpreted ORS 537.170(8) to require consider-
ation of all seven public interest factors only if it intended to
grant East Valley’s application despite having determined
that the presumption had been overcome. Because the com-
mission relied on that erroneous interpretation in its final
order, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming that order,
which we remand for further proceedings under the correct
interpretation of the law.
        The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in
part and reversed in part. The order of the Water Resources
Commission is reversed, and the case is remanded to the
Water Resources Commission for further proceedings.

    25
       Given our disposition in this case, we also do not consider it necessary
to address East Valley’s other arguments related to substantial evidence and
reasoning, as the underlying aspects of the commission’s final order are likely to
differ on remand.

        BUSHONG, J., dissenting.
         East Valley Water District (East Valley) applied for
a permit to store water for irrigation in a reservoir to be cre-
ated by building a dam on Drift Creek—a tributary of the
Pudding River. The Oregon Water Resources Commission
(commission) denied East Valley’s application, conclud-
ing that issuing the permit was not in the public interest
because the proposed dam would inundate Drift Creek,
contrary to an existing instream water right issued for the
purpose of providing the stream flows needed for cutthroat
trout habitat. The majority opinion agrees with the Court
of Appeals that the commission was entitled to consider the
beneficial purpose of the existing instream water right in
determining whether the dam proposed by East Valley was
in the public interest. I agree. However, I disagree with the
majority opinion’s further conclusion that the commission
erred in failing to consider all statutorily required public
interest factors when it denied East Valley’s application.
That conclusion leads the majority opinion to remand the
final order to the commission for consideration of those fac-
tors. Because I would affirm the final order, I dissent.
         In my view, the commission’s consideration of all
public interest factors listed in the statute was part of its
decision to deny East Valley’s application. The commission
was required by statute to consider those factors before it
could issue its final order. The commission acknowledged
that requirement and listed the public interest factors in its
final order. The majority opinion concludes that the commis-
sion nonetheless failed to consider them, because (1) it did
not expressly state that it had considered them, and (2) a
statement in the commission’s final order, read in isolation,
suggests that the commission did not consider those factors.
I disagree. As I will explain, the commission’s final order,
read in its entirety and in the context of the administra-
tive process and the governing statutory provisions, leads
me to conclude that the commission complied with the stat-
utory requirements, considered all the public interest fac-
tors, and concluded that those factors did not justify issuing
the permit that East Valley had requested. Thus, there is
no reason to remand the final order to the commission for
184      East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

“consideration” of public interest factors that the commis-
sion has already considered.
         As the majority opinion explains, the initial review
of an application starts with a rebuttable presumption that
the proposed use will not impair or be detrimental to the
public interest if four criteria are met. ORS 537.153(2). In
this case, everyone agrees that those four criteria were
met. The initial review of East Valley’s application led to a
proposed final order that would have granted East Valley’s
application in the public interest. Protests were filed and a
hearing was held before an administrative law judge, result-
ing in another proposed final order. Exceptions were filed
and the commission ultimately issued a final order denying
East Valley’s application.
        The commission concluded in its final order that the
protestants opposing East Valley’s application had overcome
the presumption that East Valley’s proposed use would not
impair or be detrimental to the public interest. Specifically,
the commission determined that the dam that East Valley
proposed to construct would lead to the inundation of Drift
Creek, thereby eliminating the benefit that the existing
instream water right provided for cutthroat trout habitat,
contrary to the public interest consideration identified in
ORS 537.170(8)(f) (requiring consideration of “[a]ll vested
and inchoate rights to the waters of this state or to the use
of the waters of this state, and the means necessary to pro-
tect such rights”).
         Under the governing statutes, the commission’s
determination that the presumption had been overcome
meant that East Valley’s proposed use “will impair or be det-
rimental to the public interest”—and thus required the com-
mission to deny the application—unless it concluded after
considering all the public interest factors that the proposed
use would not impair or be detrimental to the public interest.
See ORS 537.153(2) (stating that the rebuttable presumption
that the proposed use will not impair or be detrimental to
the public interest may be overcome by a showing that “[t]
he proposed use will impair or be detrimental to the pub-
lic interest” as demonstrated in a finding that shows “[t]he
specific public interest under ORS 537.170(8) that would be
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                                     185

impaired or detrimentally affected”); ORS 537.170(6) (stat-
ing that, if the commission determines that a proposed use
would “impair or be detrimental to the public interest” it
“shall issue a final order rejecting the application,” but if
it determines that the proposed use “would not impair or
be detrimental to the public interest” it “shall issue a final
order approving the application”).
          ORS 537.170(8) provides that, “before issuing a final
order,” the commission “shall make the final determination
of whether the proposed use * * * would impair or be detri-
mental to the public interest by considering” the seven fac-
tors listed in the statute. That requirement is prefaced with
the words, “[i]f the presumption of public interest under ORS
537.153(2) is overcome[.]” Thus, the text of ORS 537.170(8)
requires the commission to first determine whether the pre-
sumption of public interest is overcome, and, if so, it must
then consider the seven listed public interest factors “before
issuing a final order.”
         Reading those requirements in the context of ORS
537.153(2) and ORS 537.170(6) means that (1) impairing or
detrimentally affecting one of the “specific public interest[s]”
listed in ORS 537.170(8) is enough to overcome the presump-
tion of public interest; and (2) overcoming the presumption
requires the commission to issue a final order denying an
application for a proposed use, unless (3) the commission
concludes after considering all the public interest factors
listed in the statute that the application should be granted
despite the impairment or detrimental effect that the pro-
posed use would have on one or more of those factors.1 That
reading necessarily requires the commission to consider all
the listed factors in deciding whether it should (1) approve
     1
       The commission and the Court of Appeals both read the statutes the same
way. An implementing rule, OAR 690-310-0120(5), states that, if the presump-
tion that a proposed use will not impair or detrimentally affect the public interest
is overcome, the commission “shall issue a final order * * * denying the application
unless [the commission] makes specific findings to demonstrate that consider-
ing all of the public interest factors listed in ORS 537.170(8) the issuance of a
permit will not impair or be detrimental to the public interest.” The commission
quoted that rule in its final order in this case. The Court of Appeals agreed with
the commission’s reading of the statute. East Valley Water v. Water Resources
Commission, 328 Or App 790, 807 n 13, 539 P3d 789 (2023) (explaining that the
commission was required to consider all the public interest factors if it decided to
grant an application after determining that the presumption had been overcome).
186         East Valley Water v. Water Resources Commission

an application even though the rebuttable presumption had
been overcome, or (2) deny the application.
         As applied here, ORS 537.170(6) would have required
the commission to approve East Valley’s application if it
had concluded—after considering all the factors listed in
ORS 537.170(8)—that East Valley’s proposed use would not
impair or be detrimental to the public interest, despite the
impairment or detrimental effect it would have on the exist-
ing instream water rights. Because the commission denied
East Valley’s application, it did not conclude that the public
interest factors—considered in their entirety—tipped the
public interest scales in favor of issuing the requested per-
mit. If the commission had reached that conclusion, then
ORS 537.170(6) would have required it to approve East
Valley’s application.2
         The majority opinion concludes that the commis-
sion did not “consider” all the public interest factors when it
denied East Valley’s application because the commission did
not expressly say that it had considered those factors. But
as explained below, it listed those factors in its final order
and acknowledged that it “must consider” them if it decided
that the permit that East Valley had requested “should * * *
be issued” even though the presumption had been overcome.
The commission did not need to expressly state that it had
considered those factors because doing so was implicit in its
decision to deny the requested permit.
          The majority opinion reads a statement in the com-
mission’s final order as an acknowledgment that the com-
mission simply did not consider the statutory factors at all.
The commission stated in its final order that, if it “deter-
mines that the application should be denied,” it “need not
consider the factors in ORS 537.170(8) to determine whether
the proposed use should nonetheless be allowed.” That state-
ment must be read in context. Immediately before making
that statement, the commission listed all the statutory pub-
lic interest factors and acknowledged that it “must consider”

    2
       The commission noted in its final order that, “[o]n a different record, or with
a different in-stream water right” it “might well arrive at a different decision.” But
as the commission observed, East Valley’s application and the record here “provide
scant detail about the actual construction or operation of the [proposed] reservoir.”
Cite as 374 Or 148 (2025)                                  187

those factors if it “determines that the presumption is over-
come but that the permit should, notwithstanding that
determination, be issued because it will not impair or be det-
rimental to the public interest.” In other words, by expressly
acknowledging that it “must consider” the factors in decid-
ing whether the permit should be “issued,” the commission
necessarily implied that it had considered all the factors in
deciding that the permit should not be issued. That is so
because, having determined that the presumption had been
overcome, the commission’s decision to deny the application
could only have been made if, after consideration of the fac-
tors, it could not make the required determination that issu-
ance of the permit would not impair or be detrimental to the
public interest. I read the statement cited by the majority
opinion, in context, to mean that the commission need not
consider those factors again because it already considered
them when it decided that East Valley’s requested permit
should not “be issued.”
         The error in the commission’s decision identified
by the majority opinion, in my view, boils down to a fail-
ure to expressly state that it had considered all the public
interest factors when it decided to deny East Valley’s appli-
cation, not a failure to consider those factors at all. That
makes the remand ordered by the majority opinion largely
a meaningless gesture. On remand, the commission need
only state expressly what is implicit in its original order:
that after considering all the public interest factors listed in
ORS 537.170(8), it has concluded that East Valley’s proposed
use should be denied. I do not see the point in remanding to
require the commission to state explicitly what is already
implicit in its final order.
        Because East Valley has not established that the
commission erred in denying its permit application, I would
affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision that affirmed the com-
mission’s final order. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.","https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/10649766/east-valley-water-v-water-resources-commission/?q=water&type=o&order_by=score+desc&stat_Published=on",

                                       I.
      Desert Water Agency (Desert Water) and Mission Springs Water
District (Mission Springs) are both local agencies responsible for certain
water management functions in the Coachella Valley region of Riverside
County. The agencies dispute who should be the regional groundwater
sustainability agency (GSA) responsible for managing groundwater pursuant
to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, Water Code
sections 10720 to 10738 (the Act). Specifically, Mission Springs challenges
Desert Water’s claim to being the exclusive GSA within its statutory
boundaries, which subsume most of Mission Springs’ boundaries. It also
seeks resolution of competing claims to GSA authority for an additional
three-square-mile area outside of Desert Water’s statutory boundaries
(the Three-Square-Mile Area).
      Mission Springs first argues Desert Water violated Water Code
Appendix section 100-49 (section 100-49) by impairing Mission Springs’
powers. As explained below, Mission Springs has not shown Desert Water
impaired its powers simply by becoming a GSA. Even assuming it had, we
conclude the Act impliedly abrogates section 100-49 to the extent the statutes
conflict. Desert Water was expressly designated the exclusive local agency to
enforce the Act within its statutory boundaries, reflecting the intent of the
Legislature to put Desert Water in charge of GSA powers.
      Mission Springs also claims Desert Water violated Water Code
section 30065 when becoming a GSA. We find, however, Desert Water did
not “form” a public corporation or public agency within Mission Springs’
jurisdiction by becoming a GSA and therefore did not violate section 30065.
      Next, Mission Springs contends the California Department of Water
Resources (the Department) erred by posting Desert Water’s notice of intent


                                       2
to become a GSA because Desert Water failed to comply with the notice
requirements of the Act. We find Desert Water strictly or substantially
complied with all notice requirements, and thus there was no error or abuse
of discretion by the Department.
      Finally, Mission Springs claims the Department should resolve the
overlapping claims to the Three-Square-Mile Area in favor of Mission
Springs. The Act requires the agencies to resolve this dispute between
themselves and provides no role for the Department. We therefore find no
error or abuse of discretion.
      Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s judgment denying Mission
Springs’ petition for writ of mandamus.
                                       II.
                                       A.
      In 2014, the Legislature passed the Act to, among other things,
“provide for the sustainable management of groundwater basins,” “enhance
local management of groundwater consistent with rights to use or store
groundwater,” and “provide local groundwater agencies with the authority
and the technical and financial assistance necessary to sustainably manage
groundwater.” (§ 10720.1, subds. (a), (b), & (d).) To facilitate these goals, the
Act calls for the creation of “groundwater sustainability agencies” (GSAs),
providing that “any local agency or combination of local agencies overlying a
groundwater basin may decide to become a [GSA] for that basin.” (§ 10723,
subd. (a).) The Act requires the Department to classify groundwater basins
by management priority (§§ 10720.7, 10933) and mandates the creation of




                                        3
GSAs, or a specified alternative, for medium- and high-priority basins
(§ 10722.4, subd. (d)(1)).
      The Act names certain local agencies that were “created by statute to
manage groundwater” and are “deemed the exclusive local agencies within
their respective statutory boundaries with powers to comply with” the Act.
(§ 10723, subd. (c)(1).) Desert Water is one of these “exclusive local agencies.”
(Id., subd. (c)(1)(C).)
      In 2015, when Desert Water submitted its notice of intent to become a
GSA, the Act included two notice provisions. The first, in former
section 10723, subdivision (d) (repealed Jan. 1, 2016), provided: “A local
agency or combination of local agencies that elects to be the [GSA] shall
submit a notice of intent to the [D]epartment, which shall be posted pursuant
to Section 10733.3. The notice of intent shall include a description of the
proposed boundaries of the basin or portion of the basin that the local agency
or combination of local agencies intends to manage pursuant to this part.”
(Stats. 2015, ch. 255, § 6.)
      Separately, former section 10723.8 (amended Jan. 1, 2016) provided:
      (a) Within 30 days of electing to be or forming a [GSA], the [GSA]
      shall inform the [D]epartment of its election or formation and its
      intent to undertake sustainable groundwater management. The
      notification shall include the following information, as applicable:

             (1) The service area boundaries, the basin the agency is
             managing, and the other [GSAs] operating within the
             basin.

             (2) A copy of the resolution forming the new agency.

             (3) A copy of any new bylaws, ordinances, or new
             authorities adopted by the local agency.

             (4) A list of interested parties developed pursuant to
             Section 10723.2 and an explanation of how their interests

                                        4
             will be considered in the development and operation of the
             [GSA] and the development and implementation of the
             agency’s sustainability plan.

This provision further stated, “90 days following the posting of the notice
pursuant to this section, the [GSA] shall be presumed the exclusive [GSA]
within the area of the basin the agency is managing as described in the
notice, provided that no other notice was submitted.” (Stats. 2015, ch. 255,
§ 8.) Former section 10733.3 directed that the Department “shall post all
notices it receives pursuant to Section 10723 or 10723.8 on its Internet Web
site within 15 days of receipt.” (Stats. 2015, ch. 255, § 14.)
      Effective January 1, 2016, the Legislature amended these notice
provisions, eliminating section 10733.3 entirely and removing the notice
requirement of prior section 10723, subdivision (d). Section 10723.8,
subdivision (c), was amended to provide: “The decision to become a [GSA]
shall take effect 90 days after the [D]epartment posts notice under
subdivision (b) if no other local agency submits a notification under
subdivision (a) of its intent to undertake groundwater management in all or a
portion of the same area. If another notification is filed within the 90-day
period, the decision shall not take effect unless the other notification is
withdrawn or modified to eliminate any overlap in the areas proposed to be
managed. The local agencies shall seek to reach agreement to allow prompt
designation of a [GSA.]” Section 10723.8, subdivision (b), was amended to
provide, “The [D]epartment shall post all complete notices received under
this section on its Internet Web site within 15 days of receipt.” (Stats. 2015,
ch. 255, §§ 6, 8, & 14.)
                                        B.
      Mission Springs and Desert Water both provide water services in the
Coachella Valley, in and around Palm Springs. Mission Springs is a county

                                        5
water district that provides retail water and wastewater services to residents
in its jurisdiction. Desert Water is an agency created by special legislative
act to ensure adequate water supply in the region through natural and
artificial replenishment. (See Wat. Code, appen. 100.) Long ago, Mission
Springs agreed to be annexed into Desert Water’s jurisdiction to benefit from
Desert Water’s groundwater replenishment and other services. Mission
Springs is now almost entirely subsumed within Desert Water’s jurisdiction,
although the two provide retail water services in different areas:

Fig. 2 - Map of Service Areas




             7
      In November 2015, following a public hearing and a vote by its board of
directors, Desert Water filed a notice of intent to become the GSA for its
statutory boundaries and the Three-Square-Mile Area which also overlies one
of the basins in Desert Water’s boundaries. The Department posted this
notice.
          Fig. 3 - Dessert Water’s Proposed Map of GSA Boundaries




                                       8
      Mission Springs filed a notice of its intent to become a GSA on
February 3, 2016, within 90 days of Desert Water’s notice. Mission Springs’
notice proposed GSA boundaries that significantly overlapped with those in
Desert Water’s notice, including areas in Desert Water’s statutory boundaries
and the Three-Square-Mile Area. The Department rejected Mission Springs’
notice as incomplete because it sought to become a GSA for areas within
Desert Water’s statutory boundaries for which Desert Water is designated
the exclusive GSA under section 10723, subdivision (c)(1)(C).
      On September 27, 2016, Mission Springs filed an amended notice,
eliminating the overlap with Desert Water’s notice except for the Three-
Square-Mile Area. The Department posted the amended notice, noting the
overlap in the Three-Square-Mile Area.
                                        C.
      Mission Springs filed a petition for writ of mandamus against Desert
Water and the Department, seeking to invalidate Desert Water’s status as a
GSA on various grounds. Mission Springs seeks a court order removing its
statutory boundaries, which include the Three-Square-Mile Area, from the
jurisdiction of Desert Water’s GSA. It further seeks an order directing the
Department to reject as incomplete Desert Water’s notice of election to
become a GSA, to post Mission Springs’ February 2016 notice of election to
become a GSA, and to deem Mission Springs the exclusive GSA within its
statutory boundaries. After a trial, the court held in favor of Desert Water
and the Department, and denied relief to Mission Springs.
                                       III.
      Mission Springs and Desert Water have each filed requests for judicial
notice in this court. None of the information submitted by Desert Water is
relevant to our disposition; thus, its July 17, 2023, request for judicial notice


                                        9
is denied as moot. (See, e.g., Aquila, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 569.)
      We take judicial notice of several facts and one document from Mission
Springs’ request for judicial notice:
          • Facts 1-11 and 17-22, which were noticed by the trial
            court;

          • The documents attached to Mission Springs’ request as
            Exhibits 1 and 3-8, which were noticed by the trial court;
            and

          • The April 12, 2017, Letter from State Water Recourse
            Control Board to County of Monterey re: Request for
            Clarification Regarding Groundwater Sustainability
            Agency Formation Notices, which was submitted to the
            trial court and is attached to Mission Springs’ request as
            Exhibit 13.

The remaining information submitted by Mission Springs, both in its initial
and supplemental requests for judicial notice, is not relevant to our
disposition. Accordingly, Mission Springs’ Motion for Judicial Notice, dated
March 10, 2023, is denied in part as moot, and its supplemental request,
dated August 9, 2023, is denied as moot.
                                        IV.
      To state a cause of action for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, the requesting party must demonstrate: “(1) a clear
duty to act by the defendant; (2) a beneficial interest in the defendant’s
performance of that duty; (3) the defendant’s ability to perform the duty;
(4) the defendant’s failure to perform that duty or abuse of discretion if
acting; and (5) no other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy exists.” (Collins v.
Thurmond (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 879, 915 (Collins).)

      When considering a claim for mandamus relief, this court reviews the
trial court’s findings of fact for substantial evidence. (Kavanaugh v. West
Sonoma County Union High School Dist. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916.) We
review questions of law de novo. (Saathoff v. City of San Diego (1995)
35 Cal.App.4th 697, 700.)
                                        V.
      We must resolve four principal issues on appeal: (A) whether Desert
Water violated section 100-49 by becoming a GSA; (B) whether Desert Water
violated section 30065 by becoming a GSA; (C) whether the Department erred
in posting Desert Water’s notice of intent because Desert Water failed to
comply with the requirements of the Act; and (D) whether the Department
must resolve the overlapping notices relating to the Three-Square-Mile Area.
For reasons explained below, we conclude Desert Water and the Department
have complied with the Act and other provisions of the Water Code relied on
by Mission Springs. Accordingly, Mission Springs has not established it is
entitled to any of the relief sought in this action.
                                        A.
      Mission Springs alleges Desert Water violated section 100-49, part of
the “principal act” that created Desert Water, by becoming a GSA.
Section 100-49 states: “The inclusion in, or annexation or addition to this
agency, of the corporate area of any public corporation or public agency shall
not . . . impair the powers of any such public corporation or public agency[.]”
According to Mission Springs, because it consented to annexation and its
boundaries are now nearly co-extensive with Desert Water’s, section 100-49
precludes Desert Water from becoming a GSA within its statutory
boundaries. We are unpersuaded.




                                        11
      First, the Three-Square-Mile Area has not been annexed or included in
Desert Water’s statutory boundaries. Desert Water’s exercise of authority as
a GSA in this area therefore could not impair Mission Springs’ powers as a
function of annexation or inclusion in Desert Water’s jurisdiction.
Accordingly, section 100-49 is not relevant to the Three-Square-Mile Area.
      Further, Mission Springs claims Desert Water’s decision not to opt out
of being a GSA “indisputably impairs [Mission Springs’] powers and
authority” in the annexed territory. But Mission Springs only identifies
hypothetical future impairment at a general level, claiming Desert Water’s
“authority to control extraction and other water management functions . . .
impairs Mission Springs’ powers” because a GSA “has the authority to direct
Mission Springs to stop all extraction activities,” “to direct the placement and
operation of wells, and a host of other actions that directly impairs Mission
Springs’ authority within its service area.” Mission Springs cites no
authority or record evidence in support of its position. We are not required to
consider points “‘not supported by citation to authorities or the record.’” (Kim
v. Sumitomo Bank (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 974, 979 (Kim).)
      Moreover, Mission Springs fails to acknowledge it overlies medium-
priority basins that will be subject to regulation under the Act. (See
§§ 10720.7, 10722.4, subd. (d)(1), 10735.2.) Even if Desert Water were not
the GSA, Mission Springs’ groundwater extraction would likely still be
“impaired” by the new rules for groundwater sustainability. (See §§ 10727,
10733.6, 10735.2.) Mission Springs’ general arguments about new regulation
of groundwater prove too much.
      In any case, to the extent the Act and section 100-49 are inconsistent,
we find the Act impliedly abrogates section 100-49. (Cf. Protect Our
Neighborhoods v. City of Palm Springs (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 667, 677.)


                                      12
Although there is a “‘presumption against repeals by implication,’” where
“‘two acts are so inconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent
operation’” or where there is “‘undebatable evidence of an intent to supersede
the earlier’ provision,” courts will find implied repeal. (Professional
Engineers in California Government v. Kempton (2007) 
40 Cal.4th 1016,1038.) When two statutes are irreconcilable, “‘the later statute prevails.’”
(Briggs v. Brown (2017) 3 Cal.5th 808, 840.)
      The Legislature gave “powers to comply with” the Act to certain
“exclusive local agencies,” including Desert Water, and decided Desert Water
should be the exclusive GSA for its “statutory boundaries,” inclusive of
Mission Springs. (§ 10723, subd. (c)(1).) The stated purpose of the Act is “[t]o
enhance local management of groundwater” and “[t]o provide local
groundwater agencies with the authority . . . necessary to sustainably
manage groundwater.” (§ 10720.1, subds. (b), (d).) According to Mission
Springs, because the Act gives GSAs increased powers to manage
groundwater, section 100-49 would mandate that Desert Water opt out of
being the GSA within its statutory boundaries by carving out Mission
Springs. Assuming Mission Springs is correct, we find the provisions
incompatible. If section 100-49 requires Desert Water not to exercise powers
the Legislature granted, it frustrates both express provisions and the stated
purpose of the Act.
      In arguing otherwise, Mission Springs relies on Environmental Law
Foundation v. State Water Resources Control Board (2018) 
26 Cal.App.5th844 (Environmental Law Foundation). There, a party claimed the Act
impliedly repealed common law public trust duties in connection with
groundwater, claiming the Legislature intended to occupy the field. (Id. at
p. 863.) The court disagreed, citing a supreme court decision holding that the


                                       13
appropriative water rights system did not displace the public trust doctrine.
(Id. at pp. 864–865, discussing National Audubon Society v. Superior Court
(1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 445 (Audubon).) To the contrary, the supreme court
found the state had a duty to consider the public trust when administering
the appropriative water rights system. (Id. at p. 865.) Comparing it to the
water rights system at issue in Audubon, the Environmental Law Foundation
court found the Act was not sufficiently comprehensive to occupy the field of
groundwater and supplant the common law. (Id. at pp. 865–866.)
Furthermore, the court found the two systems could live in harmony: “If the
expansive and historically rooted appropriative rights system in California
did not subsume or eliminate the public trust doctrine in the state, then
certainly [the Act], a more narrowly tailored piece of legislation, can also
accommodate the perpetuation of the public trust doctrine.” (Id. at p. 866.)
      Here, we consider whether two statutes are incompatible, not whether
the Legislature intended to preempt the common law. Moreover, the court in
Environmental Law Foundation considered the effect of the Act as a whole on
a generally applicable doctrine and concluded the two were compatible. By
contrast, as explained above, we find the alleged operation of section 100-49
to be incompatible with clear and specific provisions of the Act. We thus find
Environmental Law Foundation inapposite.
      Mission Springs also endeavors a textual argument, relying on a clause
applicable to some local agencies, though not Desert Water. Section 10723,
subdivision (c)(3) provides: “A local agency with authority to implement a
basin-specific management plan pursuant to its principal act shall not
exercise any authorities granted in this part in a manner inconsistent with
any prohibitions or limitations in its principal act unless the governing board
of the local agency makes a finding that the agency is unable to sustainably


                                       14
manage the basin without the prohibited authority.” Mission Springs
reasons that, in light of this language, only a local agency with authority to
implement a basin-specific management plan pursuant to its principal act
can ever act inconsistently with its principal act when exercising authorities
under the Act. Mission Springs claims because Desert Water is undisputedly
not a local agency with authority to implement a basin-specific management,
it cannot violate its principal act. We cannot infer that because certain
agencies may only violate their principal acts in certain circumstances, other
agencies must follow their principal acts even when doing so conflicts with
the text or purpose of the Act.
      Indeed, this carve-out arguably harms Mission Springs’ position, as the
Legislature permitted some agencies to contravene their principal acts if the
“governing board of the local agency makes a finding that the agency is
unable to sustainably manage the basin without the prohibited authority.”
(§ 10723, subd. (c)(3).) That is, the overriding legislative interest expressed is
in the sustainable management of groundwater, not fidelity to principal acts.
As we have explained, Mission Springs’ interpretation would frustrate the
clear intent of the Legislature.
                                       B.
      Mission Springs next claims Desert Water violated section 30065,
which provides:
      The inclusion in, or annexation or addition to, a county water
      district, of all or any part of the corporate area of any public
      corporation or public agency, shall not destroy the identity or
      legal existence or impair the powers of any such public
      corporation or public agency, notwithstanding the identity of
      purpose, or substantial identity of purpose, of such county water
      district.




                                       15
      No public corporation or public agency having identity of purpose
      or substantial identity of purpose shall be formed partly or
      entirely within a county water district existing under the
      provisions of this code without the consent of such county water
      district. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit
      any city from annexing territory within a county water district
      without the consent of such county water district.

Mission Springs argues Desert Water “formed” a “public corporation or public
agency” when it became a GSA.
      An agency can either “elect[ ] to be or form[ ] a [GSA].” (§ 10723.8,
subd. (a); italics added; see also former § 10723.8, subd. (a) [agencies can
“decid[e] to become or form a groundwater sustainability agency”].)
Section 10723, which lists the “exclusive local agencies,” does not use the
word “form.” (§ 10723, subds. (a), (c)(3).) This was also the case at the time
Desert Water filed its notice of election. (Former § 10723, subds. (a), (c)(3).)
By contrast, section 10723.6 states: “A combination of local agencies may
form a” GSA by using a joint powers agreement, memorandum of agreement,
or other legal agreement. (§ 10723.6, subd. (a), italics added.) Although the
Act is not entirely clear on this point, it appears to contemplate existing local
agencies, including the “exclusive local agencies,” “electing” or “deciding” to
become GSAs and combinations of local agencies “forming” GSAs.
      Mission Springs does not offer any arguments that would otherwise
explain the use of both terms and instead suggests all GSAs necessarily
“form” new agencies. We cannot adopt this interpretation, which needlessly
creates surplusage. (See, e.g., People v. Valencia (2017) 3 Cal.5th 347, 357.)
Mission Springs’ interpretation is also inconsistent with the Act’s definition
of GSA, which “means one or more local agencies that implement the
provisions of this part,” and “[f]or purposes of imposing fees pursuant to
Chapter 8 . . . or taking action to enforce a groundwater sustainability plan,


                                       16
‘[GSA]’ also means each local agency comprising the [GSA] if the plan
authorizes separate agency action.” (§ 10721, subd. (j).) This definition
contemplates the continued existence of local agencies that act as GSAs.
      Mission Springs relies on Hidden Valley Municipal Water District v.
Calleguas Municipal Water District (1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 411, 412–413
(Hidden Valley), in which one municipal water district sought to annex
another to its statutory boundaries. The plaintiff, the district resisting
annexation, relied on a statute similar to section 30065, providing:
      The inclusion in, or annexation or addition to, a municipal water
      district, of the corporate area of any public corporation or public
      agency, shall not destroy the identity or legal existence or impair
      the powers of any such public corporation or public agency,
      notwithstanding the identity of purpose, or substantial identity of
      purpose, of such municipal water district. Except for formation
      proceedings commenced before the effective date of the
      amendments to this act made by the 1955 Regular Session of the
      Legislature, no public corporation or public agency having
      identity of purpose or substantial identity of purpose shall be
      formed partly or entirely within a municipal water district
      existing under this act without the consent of such municipal
      water district.

(Id. at p. 413.) The court addressed whether, in light of this statute, “the
territory of plaintiff [could] be annexed as contemplated without its consent.”
(Ibid.) The court found the only purpose of the statute was to address “the
consequences of the inclusion, in whole or in part, of the territory of an
existing district into another existing district, or a district to be newly created
of greater area.” (Id. at p. 418.) Considering that purpose, and while
acknowledging “form” was “the most appropriate word to be used” when
referring to creation of a district in the first instance, the court construed the
word “form” to also “mean ‘coming into being’ by annexation.” (Ibid.)



                                        17
      Mission Springs argues, based on Hidden Valley, Desert Water’s “GSA
was ‘formed’ when it ‘came into being’ and sought to include and absorb all of
Mission Springs and the Three-Square-Mile area.” (Italics and bolding
omitted.) But Hidden Valley dealt with one municipal water agency seeking
to annex another, a condition addressed in the first sentence of the act at
issue. (Hidden Valley, supra, 197 Cal.App.2d at pp. 412–413.) By contrast,
section 30065 first addresses annexation or addition to “a county water
district,” which Desert Water is not. The first clause of section 30065 is
meant to preserve the rights of agencies when annexed or added to a county
water district. We therefore cannot draw the same inferences warranted in
Hidden Valley because the first clause of section 30065 does not inform the
second in the manner argued by Mission Springs.
      Mission Springs contends, as a matter of fact, Desert Water “formed” a
new public agency, pointing to examples of Desert Water or its agents using
the word “form” in connection with becoming a GSA. The trial court
disagreed, finding Mission Springs “fail[ed] to demonstrate that [Desert
Water’s] election to serve as GSA resulted in the creation of a new public
agency” and finding “it is not a new public agency.” This finding is supported
by substantial evidence.
      The resolution adopted by Desert Water did not form a new entity by
joining with any other entities and instead “elect[ed] to be” a GSA. Desert
Water maintains the same corporate form and did not promulgate any
“bylaws, ordinances, or other new authorities” in connection with the decision
to become a GSA.
      Mission Springs principally points to examples of Desert Water using
the word “form” in connection with becoming a GSA. But there are also many
instances in the record of Desert Water using terms inconsistent with an


                                      18
intent to “form” a GSA, including “elect” and “become.” Indeed, the title of
the resolution passed by the board of directors is, “A RESOLUTION OF THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DESERT WATER AGENCY ELECTING TO
BECOME A [GSA] FOR PORTIONS OF THE INDIO/WHITEWATER SUB-
BASIN, THE MISSION CREEK SUB-BASIN AND SAN GORGONIO PASS
SUB-BASIN.” (Bolding added.) Given the substance of Desert Water’s
actions and our interpretation of the statutory provisions, we are not
persuaded that the intermittent use of the word “form” is probative of
Mission Springs’ position.
      Mission Springs further claims because becoming a GSA enhanced
Desert Water’s powers, it necessarily “formed” a separate agency. Mission
Springs fails to cite any authority for this contention. (See Kim, supra,
17 Cal.App.4th at p. 979.) We see no reason an agency cannot gain additional
powers without forming a new agency.
      In sum, because Desert Water did not “form” a new agency by becoming
a GSA, it did not violate section 30065. We thus do not need to address
Mission Springs’ further arguments regarding this provision.
                                       C.
      Next, Mission Springs claims Desert Water violated the Act by failing
to file an adequate notice of intent to become a GSA pursuant to
section 10723.8, subdivision (a). The Department principally contends Desert
Water did not have to comply with section 10723.8, subdivision (a), because,
in 2015, the notice standard was governed by section 10723, subdivision (d).
Desert Water claims because it was designated an “exclusive local agency,” it
did not have to file any notice and instead would automatically become a GSA
unless it opted out and, alternatively, contends its notice of election complied
with section 10723.8.


                                       19
      As an initial matter, it is undisputed that Desert Water complied with
previous section 10723, subdivision (d). Before it was repealed, that
provision stated: “A local agency . . . that elects to be the [GSA] shall submit
a notice of intent to the [D]epartment, which shall be posted pursuant to
Section 10733.3. The notice of intent shall include a description of the
proposed boundaries of the basin or portion of the basin that the local agency
or combination of local agencies intends to manage pursuant to this part.”
(Former § 10723, subd. (d).) Mission Springs does not dispute that this
provision was satisfied by Desert Water’s notice of intent.
      This does not end our analysis, however. As explained above,
section 10723.8 includes a notice requirement for agencies that have elected
to become a GSA. Both provisions were in effect when Desert Water filed its
notice in 2015. Contrary to Desert Water’s and the Department’s arguments,
the plain language of the statutes and the legislative history of the Act reflect
Desert Water had to comply with both provisions.
      First, there is no language suggesting the then-section 10723,
subdivision (d) notice was a substitute for the then-section 10723.8,
subdivision (a) notice, or that the local agencies designated by statute as
“exclusive” could bypass either notice requirement. Rather, former
section 10723.8, subdivision (a), directed, “Within 30 days of electing to be or
forming a [GSA], the [GSA] shall inform the [D]epartment of its election or
formation and its intent to undertake sustainable groundwater
management.” (Italics added.) Former section 10723, subdivision (d)
similarly provided: “A local agency . . . that elects to be the [GSA] shall
submit a notice of intent to” the Department. (Italics added.)
      Legislative history further supports that the intent was for agencies to
comply with both provisions. In connection with the original bill, the Senate


                                       20
bill analysis stated the bill would require “a local agency or combination of
local agencies that is electing to be, or forming, a GSA to notify [the
Department] of the intent to be a GSA and provide a notice to [the
Department] that includes the proposed boundaries of the GSA,” apparently
referring to the notice codified in then-section 10723, subdivision (d). (Sen.
Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1168 (2013-
2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 29, 2014.) Separately, the analysis states
the bill would, “[f]ollowing public notice, a public hearing, and final action to
become a GSA, require[ ] the GSA to notify [the Department] within 30 days
and include copies of pertinent documents, as specified,” apparently referring
to former section 10723.8, subdivision (a). (Ibid.)
      Underscoring this understanding, in 2015, the Department informed
Desert Water it would “not become a GSA until [it] compl[ied] with Water
Code Section 10723.8.” The resolution adopted by Desert Water similarly
stated that both section 10723, subdivision (d) notice and section 10723.8
notices were required.
      We therefore consider whether Desert Water’s notice complied with
section 10723.8, subdivision (a).
                                        1.
      Mission Springs argues Desert Water failed to comply with
section 10723.8, subdivision (a), in three separate ways: (a) failing to give its
retail “service area boundaries,” (b) failing to address existing multi-agency
groundwater management plans, and (c) failing to explain how it will
consider the interests of beneficial users of water in the area. We address
each claim below.




                                        21
                                       a.
      Desert Water was required to include in its notice of intent “[t]he
service area boundaries, the basin the agency is managing, and the other
[GSAs] operating within the basin.” (Former § 10723.8, subd. (a)(1).) Desert
Water’s notice included both its statutory boundaries and its proposed
boundaries as GSA. (See Fig. 3.) Mission Springs does not dispute that
Desert Water provides “services” by managing the water supply throughout
its statutory boundaries. Mission Springs nonetheless claims the notice is
deficient because Desert Water did not provide its “retail” service area
boundaries. (See Fig. 2.)
      There is no indication that an agency must include its retail service
areas to comply with section 10723.8. The local agencies who may serve as
GSAs must have “water supply, water management, or land use
responsibilities within a groundwater basin.” (§ 10721, subd. (n), italics
added.) Because an agency is eligible to become a GSA without any retail
water service area at all, we are not persuaded that “service area” means
retail service area. Moreover, there is no reason relevant to the Act for an
agency to provide its retail service area. Any “local agencies overlying a
groundwater basin may decide to become a [GSA] for that basin,” and Desert
Water and others were “deemed the exclusive local agencies within their
respective statutory boundaries.” (§ 10723, subds. (a), (c).) When informing
the Department of its decision to become a GSA, the relevant question is
where the agency’s boundaries are relative to the basins, not where an
agency provides retail water service. Mission Springs’ interpolation is not
supported by the text or purpose of the Act.
      Mission Springs argues the notice was also deficient because Desert
Water proposed to become a GSA for the Three-Square-Mile area, which is


                                      22
outside of its statutory boundaries. Mission Springs grounds this argument
in guidelines promulgated by the Department in October 2015 that say the
Department will reject a notice as incomplete if a local agency “[d]ecid[es] to
become or form a GSA for an area that is outside the service area boundary of
the local agency(s) forming the GSA.” The Department’s 2015 guidelines
“reflect[ed] the amendments made to [the Act] which . . . bec[ame] law on
January 1, 2016.” (Stats. 2015, ch. 255, § 8; see Cal. Const., art. IV, § 8,
subd. (c)(1).) When Desert Water filed its notice, the Act did not require a
“complete” notice. (Former § 10723.8.) The Department’s guidelines on what
rendered a notice “incomplete” are therefore not relevant to Desert Water’s
notice.
      Furthermore, there is no apparent statutory basis for this guidance,
and the Department now disavows this reading. We agree with the
Department’s current interpretation, which is supported by the plain
language of the text. Again, the Act provides that “any local agency . . .
overlying a groundwater basin may decide to become a [GSA] for that basin.”
(§ 10723, subd. (a), italics added.) It does not limit GSA formation to the
service area or statutory boundaries of the agency. The notice requirements
in effect in 2015 did not limit GSA formation either, requiring GSAs to
include “[t]he service area boundaries, the basin the agency is managing, and
the other [GSAs] operating within the basin.” (Former § 10723.8,
subd. (a)(1).) Former Section 10723.8, subdivision (b), provided the GSA
could then become the exclusive GSA “within the area of the basin the agency
is managing as described in the notice, provided that no other notice was
submitted.”
      In the absence of textual support from the Act itself, Mission Springs
points to a September 2015 email from a Department representative to a


                                       23
Desert Water representative, stating, “Some level of legal coordination
with [Mission Springs] will likely be required to include/incorporate [the
Three-Square-Mile Area] to represent the GSA boundary for” Desert Water.
However, that equivocal statement is premised by a disclaimer: “I am not
able to comment definitively on what legal steps would need to be covered to
include/incorporate [the Three-Square-Mile Area] as part of [Desert Water]
agency boundary as a GSA.” We do not find this email persuasive as to the
meaning of the Act.
                                       b.
      Mission Springs claims Desert Water “failed to discuss how it will treat
the approved and adopted multi-agency groundwater management plans
already in place in the Coachella Valley Basin.” But this is not information
required by current or former section 10723.8, subdivision (a), and Mission
Springs does not identify any other source of this purported requirement.
Accordingly, Mission Springs has not shown the omission of this information
rendered the notice deficient.
                                       c.
      A notice of intent must also include: “A list of interested parties
developed pursuant to Section 10723.2 and an explanation of how their
interests will be considered in the development and operation of the [GSA]
and the development and implementation of the agency’s sustainability
plan.” (§ 10723.8, subd. (a)(4).) As Mission Springs points out, Desert Water
did not explain how it would consider the interests of stakeholders.
Nonetheless, we conclude Desert Water substantially complied with the Act.
      If a statute is directory (as opposed to mandatory), then substantial (as
opposed to literal) compliance may suffice “if the purpose of the statute is
satisfied.” (See Manderson-Saleh v. Regents of University of California (2021)


                                       24
60 Cal.App.5th 674, 703 (Manderson-Saleh).) Even when a statute employs
“mandatory terms,” “‘[i]f a statutory directive does not go to “‘the essence’ of
the particular object sought to be obtained, or the purpose to be
accomplished” and a “departure from the statute will cause no injury to any
person affected by it,” the provision will be deemed directory.’” (Id. at
pp. 703–704.)
      The requirement to explain in the notice how a proposed GSA will
consider the interests of interested parties is directory rather than
mandatory. The provision is intended to ensure interested parties are on
notice and their interests are considered. In view of the larger statutory
scheme, these purposes are sufficiently served by Desert Water’s notice,
which lists interested parties by category and by name, following
section 10723.2.
      Importantly, independent of the notice requirement, the interests of
beneficial users must be considered. Desert Water was required to, and did,
hold a public hearing on becoming a GSA, permitting stakeholders, including
beneficial users and other interested parties, to provide public comment.
(§ 10723, subd. (b).) Indeed, at least three Mission Springs representatives
attended the meeting and provided comments. In addition, GSAs have a duty
to “consider the interests of all beneficial uses and users of groundwater, as
well as those responsible for implementing groundwater sustainability
plans.” (§ 10723.2.) This requirement is included in Chapter 4 of the Act,
titled “Establishing Groundwater Agencies.” Thus, whether or not there is
an explanation in the notice of intent, interested parties must have their
interests considered in connection with the “development and operation of the
[GSA].” (§ 10723.8, subd. (a)(4).)




                                       25
      Concerning “implementation of the agency’s sustainability plan”
(§ 10723.8, subd. (a)(4)), there is also a separate provision requiring GSAs to
consider stakeholder interests: “Prior to initiating the development of a
groundwater sustainability plan, the [GSA] shall make available to the public
and the department a written statement describing the manner in which
interested parties may participate in the development and implementation of
the groundwater sustainability plan.” (§ 10727.8 (a).) Notwithstanding
section 10723.8, subdivision (a)(4), interested parties must be given notice
and the opportunity to participate in a GSA’s implementation of its
sustainability plan.
      Mission Springs does not claim Desert Water did not actually consider
the interests of interested parties, only that they did not include an
explanation of how they would do so in their notice. And Mission Springs has
not shown that any party was prejudiced by Desert Water’s omission. This is
the kind of technical error that may be excused as substantial compliance. In
Manderson-Saleh, supra, 60 Cal.App.5th at pp. 681, 702, for example, the
court found substantial compliance with a regulation requiring certain forms
to designate a pension beneficiary where the pensioner had given her
employer actual notice of her intent but had not returned the required forms
before she died. Similarly, Desert Water’s actions, including (we must
presume) compliance with other provisions of the Act, constituted substantial
compliance with section 10723.8.
      Finally, we note the effect of failing to file a non-compliant notice.
When Desert Water filed, the only effect of posting the notice was that
“90 days following the posting of the notice pursuant to this section, the
[GSA] [would] be presumed the exclusive [GSA] within the area of the basin
the agency is managing as described in the notice, provided that no other


                                       26
notice was submitted.” (Former § 10723.8, subd. (b).) An exclusive local
agency could comply with the Act by “electing to become a [GSA] pursuant to”
section 10723. (Former § 10723, subd. (c)(3).) Only in 2016 was the statute
amended to provide: “The decision of a local agency or combination of
agencies to become a [GSA] shall take effect as provided in Section 10723.8.”
(§ 10723, subd. (d).) Thus, even in the absence of a posted notice, Desert
Water had “compl[ied] with” the Act by “electing to become a” GSA and filing
a notice that complied with former section 10723, subdivision (d). (Former
§ 10723, subd. (c)(3).) Had the Department rejected Desert Water’s notice,
Desert Water could have re-posted and would still be deemed the exclusive
GSA within its statutory boundaries. (Former § 10723.8, subd. (b); § 10723,
subd. (c)(1)(C).) As to the Three-Square-Mile Area, the notices would still be
deemed overlapping because Desert Water’s putatively deficient notice was
“filed within” 90 days of Mission Springs’ 2016 notice. (§ 10723.8, subd. (d),
italics added; § 10723.8, subd. (b).)
                                        2.
      Because Desert Water’s notice substantially complied with the Act, the
Department did not err by posting that notice and declining to post Mission
Springs’ February 2016 notice. Desert Water was authorized by statute to
become the exclusive GSA for its statutory boundaries. (§ 10723,
subd. (c)(1).) Mission Springs sought to become a GSA for these areas, too.
Because Desert Water opted into becoming a GSA, there is no mechanism by
which Mission Springs could be the GSA for areas within Desert Water’s
statutory boundaries unless Desert Water opted out. (§ 10723, subd. (c)(2).)
Mission Springs has not shown the Department’s refusal to post a notice that
sought to claim areas committed by statute to Desert Water’s management




                                        27
was a “failure to perform [a] duty or [an] abuse of discretion.” (Collins, supra,
41 Cal.App.5th at p. 915.)
      In addition, Desert Water was authorized by statute to become a GSA
for any basin it overlies. (§ 10723, subd. (a) [“[A]ny local agency or
combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin may decide to
become a [GSA] for that basin.”]; § 10723.8, subd. (a)(1) [GSAs to provide “the
boundaries of the basin or portion of the basin the agency intends to manage
pursuant to this part”].) By the time Mission Springs filed its notice, in the
event of overlapping notices “filed within [a] 90-day period, the decision [to
become a GSA would] not take effect unless the other notification [were]
withdrawn or modified to eliminate any overlap in the areas proposed to be
managed.” (§ 10723.8, subd. (c).) Mission Springs does not argue the
Department lacked the authority to reject its first notice if Desert Water’s
were properly posted. Again, there is no apparent “failure to perform [a] duty
or abuse of discretion.” (Collins, supra, 41 Cal.App.5th at p. 915.)
                                       D.
      Finally, Mission Springs contends the Three-Square-Mile Area is
within its statutory boundaries and not within Desert Water’s, and thus
Mission Springs should be the exclusive GSA for this area. But the
Department has no duty to adjudicate overlapping notices, and thus there are
no grounds for issuing a writ of mandamus.
      If two notifications are filed within a 90-day period, the decision to
become a GSA does not take effect unless one of the notices is withdrawn or
amended. (§ 10723.8, subd. (c).) In that case, “The local agencies shall seek to
reach agreement to allow prompt designation of a [GSA].” (Ibid., italics
added.) As Mission Springs acknowledged at oral argument, the Department
is not given any role in resolving conflicting notices. Accordingly, Mission


                                       28
Springs has not identified “a clear duty to act by the” Department and is not
entitled to mandamus relief. (Collins, supra, 41 Cal.App.5th at p. 915.)
      Mission Springs nonetheless asks us to take judicial notice of an
advisory opinion letter, sent in April 2017, by the State Water Board. We
will do so, as the letter was submitted to the trial court, and an advisory
letter may constitute an “‘official act’” of an “‘executive . . . department[.]’”
(See Fisher v. County of Orange (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 39, 48.) However, the
letter does not support Mission Springs’ position. An agency requested the
opinion of the Water Board with respect to its overlapping notice with
another local agency’s. The Water Board opined that, because the
overlapping area was not within the statutory boundaries of the requesting
agency, and because a GSA cannot regulate outside of its statutory
boundaries, the overlap should be resolved in favor of the agency who could
regulate. The Water Board’s letter does not suggest that the Department is
responsible for resolving disputes between overlapping claims. Moreover, the
“letter offer[ed] a non-binding, advisory opinion.” According to the letter
itself, “It is not a declaratory decision and does not bind the State Water
Board in any future determination.” As it is not binding on the Water Board,
the letter is also not intended to bind any other agency or the court.
      We note that there appears to be a limited mechanism for resolving
overlapping notices. While local cooperation is a laudable ideal, as this case
demonstrates, not all agencies will be able to “reach agreement to allow
prompt designation of a” GSA. This has resulted in resources that should be
put toward sustainable groundwater management—an urgent need in
California—being put toward litigation. We would respectfully urge the
Legislature, which has thoughtfully amended the Act in recent years, to




                                         29
consider adopting an alternative solution that would obviate years-long
disputes like this one.
                                     VI.
      The judgment is affirmed. Respondents are entitled to costs on appeal.

          v.

 SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER
 DISTRICT,

          Defendant and Respondent.


         This litigation began in 2005, when plaintiff Great Oaks Water Company (Great
Oaks), a private water retailer that pumps and sells non-agricultural groundwater from its
own wells, sued the Santa Clara Valley Water District (water district, or district), alleging
that the district’s groundwater pumping charges constituted unlawful property-related
taxes levied without voter approval, in violation of the constitutional provisions
implemented by Proposition 218. This court ultimately held in 2018 that those charges
were not property-related taxes.
         In the current iteration of the lawsuit, Great Oaks argues that the non-agricultural
groundwater pumping charges for certain years constitute unlawful taxes levied without
voter approval in violation of the constitutional provisions implemented by Proposition
26, enacted by voters in 2010. Great Oaks contends that the charges are more than
necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the relevant governmental activity, and that the
manner in which those costs are allocated to Great Oaks does not bear a fair or reasonable
relationship to the benefits it receives from, or the burdens it imposes on, that
                                                          1
governmental activity, in violation of California Constitution article XIII C, section 1,
subdivision (e).
       According to Great Oaks, the water district uses revenue from the groundwater
charges to subsidize its customers who receive water from alternative sources, such as
imported or recycled water, to which Great Oaks has no access. In addition, Great Oaks
argues that the water district’s use of ad valorem property taxes to subsidize its heavily
discounted agricultural groundwater pumping charges violates the California Constitution
and relevant Water Code provisions.
       The trial court rejected Great Oaks’s arguments and entered judgment in the water
district’s favor. It held that: (1) the groundwater charges did not exceed the costs of the
relevant governmental activity, which it defined as the water district’s overall water
management program; (2) it is reasonable to use those charges to pay for overall program
costs because non-agricultural groundwater pumpers like Great Oaks receive significant
benefits from the overall program; (3) the non-agricultural groundwater charges were
reasonably allocated on a volumetric basis to the thousands of non-agricultural
groundwater pumpers like Great Oaks; and (4) the discount for agricultural groundwater
pumping is constitutionally valid because it is not funded with the money received from
non-agricultural pumpers such as Great Oaks, but instead with an “open space credit”
paid for with revenue from ad valorem property taxes imposed by Santa Clara County
and transferred to the district.
       Great Oaks challenges these holdings on appeal.
       We conclude the groundwater charges levied against Great Oaks are not “taxes”
because they fall under exceptions set out in Proposition 26. for a specific benefit
conferred or privilege granted, or a specific government service or product provided
directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C,
§ 1, subd. (e)(1), (2).) We also conclude the trial court properly determined the water
district carried its burden under Proposition 26 to prove by a preponderance of the

                                              2
evidence that the groundwater charges were not more than necessary to cover the
reasonable costs of the relevant governmental activity, and that the manner in which
those costs were allocated to Great Oaks bore a fair or reasonable relationship to the
benefits it receives from, and the burdens it imposes on, that governmental activity.
Finally, we conclude the water district’s use of ad valorem taxes to fund the agricultural
discount does not violate the California Constitution or Water Code.
       We affirm.
                      I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND1
       A. History and formation of the water district
       Groundwater pumping in Santa Clara County (County) began in the 1850s, when
the first wells were drilled to supply water for residents, businesses, and agricultural uses.
By the 1920s, the rate of pumping vastly exceeded the rate of natural replenishment,
resulting in declining groundwater supplies, permanent land subsidence, and significant
flooding. As a result, in 1929 the Legislature created the Santa Clara Valley Water
Conservation District, a predecessor to the water district, to comprehensively manage
water resources, stop groundwater overdraft and land subsidence, and protect the County
from flooding.
       In the 1930s, the water district constructed several conservation reservoirs to
capture rainfall and begin replenishing the underground aquifer through managed
groundwater recharge. However, over the course of the 1940s, the County’s population
grew from 30,000 to nearly 300,000. That growth, together with severe drought
conditions, further depleted groundwater supplies, worsened subsidence, and caused
saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. As a result, in 1951 the Legislature created the Santa
Clara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District. (Stats. 1951, ch. 1405, § 2,



       1
        We take our facts from the administrative record lodged with the trial court and
included in the record on appeal.

                                              3
p. 3337.) In 1968, that agency merged with the agency created in 1929 to form the water
district.
        B. District’s water supply system and conjunctive use policy
        The annual amount of groundwater pumped in the County still far exceeds what is
naturally replenished. To counteract overdraft and its negative effects, the water district
both replenishes the groundwater supply in various ways and provides water from other
sources. The overall water supply system is composed of storage, conveyance, recharge,
treatment, and distribution facilities.
        To avoid overdraft, the water district captures runoff in reservoirs and releases it
into recharge ponds for percolation into the groundwater basin. Water is also imported
from the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project, some of which is delivered
to streams and ponds for percolation. Roughly half of the district’s total water supply
comes from local sources, while the other half is imported. Some raw local and imported
water is turned into drinking water at treatment plants, referred to as “in-lieu recharge.”
        The water district describes its overall water management strategy as one of
“conjunctive use,” or the coordinated use of groundwater and surface water resources.
According to the district, the “conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater
maximizes water supply reliability, allowing [it] to store surface water in local
groundwater basins to help balance pumping and provide reserves for use during dry
years when surface water availability is limited.” It also helps protect against
groundwater overdraft and land subsidence, prevent saltwater intrusion, and enhance
natural recharge. Under this approach, the district treats water as a fungible commodity,
regardless of its source or cost, and “[t]he overall reliability of the water supply system is
greatly enhanced when all of the components are combined to complete the water supply
picture.”
        As discussed further below, the water district’s taxing and pricing policy
establishes groundwater charges that reflect the conjunctive management of surface

                                               4
water, groundwater supplies, imported water, and recycled water, to prevent the overuse
of the groundwater basin and promote effective use of alternative water resources.
          C. Structure of the water district
          The water district is a special district governed by the Santa Clara Valley Water
District Act (Chapter 60 of the Statutes of 1951), set forth in the Water Code Appendix
(District Act, or Act).2 The purpose of the District Act is to authorize the water district to
provide comprehensive water management for all beneficial uses and flood risk reduction
within the County. (§ 4, subd. (a).) The Act empowers the water district to undertake a
range of actions, such as to “provide for the conservation and management of stormwater,
recycled water, or other water from any sources within or outside the watersheds in
which the district is located for beneficial and useful purposes, including spreading,
storing, retaining, and causing the waters to percolate into the soil within the district.”
(§ 4, subd. (c)(3).)
          It also authorizes the water district’s board to establish various zones within the
district boundaries, and to implement projects for the specific benefit of particular zones.
(§ 3.) The water district is required to establish the zones prior to imposing any
groundwater charge. (§ 26.2.) Accordingly, the water district has established two
distinct zones of benefit based on the groundwater basins and water sources used within
each zone—zone W-2, known as the “north zone,” and zone W-5, known as the “south
zone.” Each zone has its own separate water system and different costs for providing
services, but both zones use local and imported water to replenish the groundwater
basins.


          2
        Unspecified statutory references to the District Act are to this uncodified law as
reprinted in West’s Annotated Water Code Appendix. “Much of California’s water law
is comprised of ‘uncodified acts,’ also known and referred to as the ‘Water Code
Appendix.’ ” (Legislative Intent Service, Inc. California Water Code Statutory History,
http://www.legintent.com/california-water-code-statutory-history, [as of February 25,
2025].)

                                                 5
       The north zone covers 240 square miles overlaying the Santa Clara groundwater
subbasin and includes most of the County’s population, as well as its more densely
populated residential and industrial areas. This zone requires imported water to bolster
the water supply and includes three water treatment plants and distribution pipelines to
receive, filter and distribute the imported water.
       The south zone covers just 14 square miles of sparsely populated and primarily
agricultural areas, overlaying two other groundwater subbasins and relying primarily on
groundwater to serve roughly 50 percent agricultural and 50 percent non-agricultural
water needs. No treated water is served to customers in the south zone, while only a
small amount of treated and imported water is used to recharge the groundwater
subbasins, which have the ability to absorb recharge and remain healthy at current water
usage levels, unlike the north zone.
       The zones group groundwater pumpers who are similarly situated with respect to
the district’s water supplies, and provide the basis for the water district’s groundwater
charges, which help pay for operations and capital projects associated with groundwater
preservation and distribution of all water sources.
       D. Groundwater pumping charges
       The water district’s board has the power “to levy and collect a ground water
charge for the production of water from the ground water supplies within a zone or zones
of the district which will benefit from the recharge of underground water supplies or the
distribution of imported water in such zone or zones.” (§ 26.) The District Act declares
that such groundwater charges are “in furtherance of district activities in the protection
and augmentation of the water supplies for users within a zone or zones of the district that
are necessary for the public health, welfare, and safety of the people of this state.”
(§ 26.3, subd. (a).) Groundwater charges are authorized to be levied on the production of
groundwater from all water-producing facilities within the zones of the water district “for



                                              6
the benefit of all who rely directly or indirectly on the groundwater supplies of the zone
or zones and water imported into the zone or zones.” (§ 26.3, subd. (a).)
       The District Act specifies that the proceeds of such groundwater charges must be
used exclusively for the following purposes only: (1) constructing, maintaining, and
operating facilities to import water into the district to benefit the zone or zones; (2)
purchasing water for importation into the zone or zones; (3) constructing, maintaining,
and operating facilities to conserve or distribute water within the zone or zones, including
for groundwater recharge, surface distribution, and purification and treatment; and (4) to
pay bonded indebtedness or other obligations incurred by the water district for any of the
purposes set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3). (§ 26.3, subd. (b).)
       E. Taxing and pricing policy
       The water district has adopted a resolution entitled “Water Utility Taxing and
Pricing Policy” (pricing policy), which establishes pricing objectives and constraints for
groundwater charges and other water usage rates. The pricing policy states that “[t]he
general approach is to charge the recipients of the various benefits for the benefits
received from the [water district’s] comprehensive water utility program.” It describes
the “consumptive and nonconsumptive benefits” provided by the water district’s overall
operations as: (1) provision of a water supply and effective management of water
resources available to the community from a variety of sources of supply, transmission,
and water treatment facilities; (2) protection of water quality through the purification and
treatment of water and the protection of water supplies; (3) stewardship of watersheds
and riparian corridor; (4) administration of related programs and projects such as recycled
water and water conservation; (5) flood protection; (6) recreation; (7) economic benefit
for the community; and (8) protection of community infrastructure from subsidence.
       The pricing policy enumerates four taxing and pricing concepts that guide the
water district’s approach to rate setting. First, water is considered to be a single
commodity regardless of its source or cost, so that all users are deemed to benefit from

                                               7
the availability of multiple sources. Second, the water district views all water supply
facilities as contributing to the common benefit of effective water resources management,
so that water charges are based on the common benefits of capital and operations outlays,
rather than by reference to named facilities. Third, the district manages water supplies
through taxing and pricing to utilize water resources to the advantage of the present and
future populations of the County, including the effective use of available resources and
supplies for potential drought conditions. Finally, the water district collects revenues in a
common fund, rather than designating them for a specific cost, so that revenues are
available for general capital and operating outlays. As a result, the water district sets
water charges to provide the revenues required in the common fund for general capital
and operating outlays which are over and above revenues from ad valorem taxes, interest,
and other sources.
       Each year, the water district estimates future revenues, capital and operations
costs, debt proceeds, projected demand, and available supply, to create a rolling 10-year
expenditure forecast that provides the basis for developing budget targets and analyzing
the long-term financial sustainability of district funds. The amount of projected costs that
are not funded by property taxes, interest earnings, debt proceeds, and other income is
covered by water charges. A water charge projection is then calculated for each zone to
recover the revenue requirements over a 10-year time period. Each year, the water
district also prepares an annual report on the Protection and Augmentation of Water
Supplies, which is required by the District Act to include “information specifying the
benefits that have been received and will be received within the zone or zones where a
groundwater charge has been levied and collected.” (§ 26.5, subd. (b)(4).)
       Since 2010, the water district has employed a six-step process for establishing its
groundwater rates. First, the water district identifies pricing objectives and constraints,
such as revenue sufficiency and stability, the cost of service-based allocations, legal



                                              8
considerations, environmental stewardship, economic development, demand
management, and minimization of customer impacts.
       Second, the district identifies revenue requirements, which include all costs
incurred to operate its water utility division, such as operations and maintenance costs,
funding sources for the capital improvement plan, and debt-service requirements, within
the scope of the allowable uses of groundwater revenues set forth in section 26.3.
       Third, after the revenue requirements have been identified, costs are allocated to
various customer classes. The allocation process consists of three steps: (1) allocation to
functions, such as obtaining or transmitting water supply sources, water treatment, and
management and administration costs; (2) allocation to zones; and (3) allocation to
customer classes, such as recipients of groundwater, treated, imported or recycled water.
       Fourth, the water district allocates offsets to the customer classes, generated from
non-user-related revenues, consistent with the revenue pooling concept articulated in the
pricing policy through which the water district collects revenues in a common fund,
rather than designating them for a specific cost.3 Once the offsets have been allocated,
they are subtracted from the allocated revenues to derive the net revenue requirements to
be recovered from rates.
       Fifth, the water district develops unit costs of service by customer class. To do
this, the net revenue requirements are divided by the projected units of usage of acre-feet
of water for each customer class. As the water district explains it, the resulting unit cost
represents the unit cost if there were no conjunctive use benefit, and the district did not
have policies to achieve specific pricing objectives.




       3
         Some revenues, such as certain property taxes, are designated for specific costs
and therefore are not part of the revenue pooling. The water district uses a portion of the
revenue it receives from the County via ad valorem property taxes to fund the discount
for agricultural groundwater pumpers, as discussed below.

                                              9
       Sixth, final unit rates are developed for each customer class by making two
adjustments to ensure that the rate structure is consistent with the water district’s primary
pricing objectives. An agricultural adjustment is made to comply with a particular
provision in the pricing policy, which mandates that rates for agricultural water not
exceed one-tenth the rate for all water other than agricultural water. The District Act
mandates that the rate for agricultural water not exceed one-fourth of the rate for all water
other than agricultural water, but the water district has elected to impose a steeper
discount. (§ 26.7, subd. (a)(3)(D).) The pricing policy states: “In order to encourage the
continuance of agricultural use of land in the County, to encourage the preservation of
open space, to defer intensification of users and to further support the limitation imposed
by the State Legislature, it is the District’s policy that rates for agricultural water shall not
exceed one-tenth the rate for all water other than agricultural water.” This agricultural
discount is referred to by the water district as the “Open Space Credit.”
       Separately, a conjunctive use adjustment, sometimes called a treated water
adjustment, is made so that groundwater and treated water customers are “economically
indifferent” to which source of water they receive, for example by reallocating some of
the costs of treated or recycled water to groundwater users.
       Water-year 2011–2012 provides an example of how the water district conducted
this six-step pricing methodology for the north zone.4 First, the water district calculated
the total north zone program requirements, consisting of operating outlays plus capital
costs and transfers, to be $191,107,000. Next, it applied non-rate revenues such as
property taxes, interest earnings, capital contributions, capital cost recovery, and debt
proceeds to the program costs, resulting in adjusted revenue requirements after offsets of
$122,530,000.

       4
         The District Act defines a “water year” as July 1 of one calendar year to June 30
of the following calendar year. (§ 26.1.)


                                               10
      The water district then reallocated $21,917,000 of treated water costs to
groundwater users based on proportional usage, to meet the pricing policy objectives and
conjunctive use policy. The resulting charge for non-agricultural groundwater was $569
per acre-foot. Based on that rate, non-agricultural groundwater revenue was projected to
be $52,329,000. Total aggregate water rate revenue including groundwater, treated
water, and surface water was projected to be $122,311,000.
      Finally, agricultural groundwater was subsidized with $194,000 in ad valorem
property tax revenues—the open space credit—bringing the agricultural groundwater rate
down to $17.10 per acre foot.
      F. Initial lawsuit and court of appeal opinions
      Great Oaks filed the initial lawsuit in this case in November 2005—case No.
H035260—in which it alleged that the groundwater charges levied against it in water
year 2005–2006 were property-related taxes in violation of the District Act and the
constitutional provisions enacted by Proposition 218, which provisions impose
procedural and substantive constraints on fees and charges levied by local public
entities. The trial court agreed and awarded a complete refund of the charges paid by
Great Oaks.
      This court ultimately held that the groundwater charges were property-related
charges, but that they were exempt from Proposition 218’s voter approval requirement
because they were also a charge for water service. However, the California Supreme
Court then granted Great Oaks’s petition for review.5
      At roughly the same time, the California Supreme Court also granted review in a
case from the Second District with similar facts and issues. That resulted in the Supreme
Court’s 2017 decision in City of San Buenaventura v. United Water Conservation District

      5
        This court’s opinion was initially published—Great Oaks Water Company v.
Santa Clara Valley Water District (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1187—but was later
depublished following Supreme Court review.

                                           11
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 1191 (San Buenaventura I), in which it held that groundwater charges
levied by that water district were not property-related fees subject to the requirements of
Proposition 218. However, the Court also held that the charges were subject to
evaluation as taxes under Proposition 26, which had been enacted in 2010. (Id. at pp.
1198, 1214–1215.) Because the Second District Court of Appeal had not sufficiently
conducted that evaluation, the California Supreme Court remanded the matter for it to do
so.6 (Id. at p. 1215.)
       As a result, the California Supreme Court also directed this court to vacate its
decision and reconsider the cause in light of San Buenaventura I. (Great Oaks Water
Company v. Santa Clara Valley Water District (2018) 419 P.3d 923.) That resulted in
this court’s subsequent unpublished decision in 2018, in which we reversed the trial court
and held that the groundwater charges levied against Great Oaks for water year 2005–
2006 were not property-related charges under article XIII D of the California Constitution
(Great Oaks I).
       We did not address the application of Proposition 26, however, because Great
Oaks had not yet brought such a challenge, as the initial lawsuit had been filed before
Proposition 26 was enacted.
       G. Amended master complaint and hearing
       In the meantime, because Great Oaks I had only adjudicated the water district’s
charges levied in fiscal year 2005–2006, Great Oaks had continued to file additional
lawsuits challenging every subsequent water year’s charges. Following remand after
Great Oaks I, the trial court ordered Great Oaks to file an amended master complaint




       6
       That later resulted in another published opinion from the Second District Court
of Appeal, in which it conducted the analysis pursuant to Proposition 26. (City of San
Buenaventura v. United Water Conservation District (2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 110 (San
Buenaventura II).)

                                             12
challenging all the charges in all water years, which resulted in the instant lawsuit, Case
No. H050939.
        Great Oaks filed the operative first amended master complaint on February 22,
2021 (complaint).7 It alleged that the water district’s groundwater charges levied against
it in both zones, from 2010 to the date of the complaint, violated the provisions of the
California Constitution enacted by Proposition 26. Specifically, it alleged that the
charges violated Proposition 26 because they were more than necessary to cover the
reasonable costs of the governmental activity, and the manner in which those costs were
allocated to Great Oaks did not bear a fair or reasonable relationship to Great Oaks’s
burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental activities. According to Great
Oaks, the groundwater charges therefore constituted taxes that required, but had not
obtained, voter approval.8
        Great Oaks also alleged that the Open Space Credit—the method by which the
water district has discounted its agricultural groundwater charges and has funded those
discounts—violates the California Constitution and the District Act.
        The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, a writ of mandate, and a
refund of groundwater charges for the challenged years.
        The water district certified and lodged the administrative record in January 2021.9
The parties then submitted briefing both before and after a four-day hearing held in June
2022.

        7
         The complaint included two additional named plaintiffs—Mike Rawitser Golf
Shop and Santa Teresa Golf Club—which are no longer parties to the action.
       8
         The parties stipulated that Proposition 26 was not retroactive, so the groundwater
charges levied between 2005 and November 2010—the effective date of Proposition
26—were not subject to the constitutional provisions implemented by the measure.
Nevertheless, Great Oaks alleged that the groundwater charges for those years were
unlawful taxes.
       9
         Great Oaks initially objected to the administrative record, but the trial court
overruled those objections. Great Oaks does not challenge the validity of the
administrative record on appeal.

                                             13
       H. Trial court statement of decision
       The trial court issued its final statement of decision in February 2023. It began by
stating that the first two exceptions to a “tax” under Proposition 26 were “potentially
applicable” to the groundwater charges at issue: either a specific benefit conferred, or
privilege granted, or a specific government service or product provided, “directly to the
payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable
costs to the local government.” (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e)(1), (2).)
       The court then conducted what the California Supreme Court has labeled the
“aggregate cost inquiry”—whether the charges were more than necessary to cover the
reasonable costs of the relevant governmental activity—and the separate “allocation
inquiry”—whether the manner in which those costs were allocated to Great Oaks bore a
fair or reasonable relationship to the benefits it receives from, or the burdens it imposes
on, that governmental activity, as required by Proposition 26. (San Buenaventura I,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1212; Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e).)
       With respect to the aggregate cost inquiry, the trial court began by resolving
definitional disputes regarding what constitutes the relevant “charge” and “governmental
activity.” It first held that the relevant charges are the non-agricultural groundwater
pumping charges—in other words, the charges that Great Oaks is challenging—while the
governmental activity is, as the water district had contended, the entire water utility
program, “because all the Water Utility’s work is aimed, in some fashion, toward its
mission of preserving and distributing groundwater,” including, for instance, the water
district’s in-lieu recharge and conjunctive use program, as well as capital projects relating
to water supply.
       The court then compared, on a zone-by-zone and year-by-year basis, the non-
agricultural groundwater charge revenues with the program costs of the entire water
utility program and determined—based on the financial numbers from the water district’s
reports—that they satisfied the aggregate cost inquiry.

                                              14
       With respect to the allocation inquiry, the trial court began by making certain
threshold legal determinations. First, it held that the allocation determination may be
done on a group basis, as opposed to a payor-by-payor basis, because the question of
proportionality—that is, the fairness or reasonableness of a proposed allocation—is not
measured on an individual basis, but rather by collectively considering all
ratepayers. Second, the court held that volumetric charges are a fair way of allocating
costs, as long as they are imposed on similarly situated users, because the more water
pumped, the more benefit a payor would receive from a local government agency
designed to preserve, obtain and deliver that water.
       The trial court then held there was substantial evidence in the record showing that
providing alternative sources of water to some, but not all, groundwater pumpers reduces
over-drafting and maintains the supply for other pumpers in the area. In other words,
“water is fungible.” In addition, the court held that the record supported the propriety of
allocating some costs of treated and recycled groundwater to groundwater pumpers, even
those that do not use such treated or recycled water, as part of the conjunctive use
policy. Further, it held, the water district has the statutory authority under the enabling
statutes to regulate groundwater in a comprehensive way, and has set its groundwater
charges based on various factors such as each zone’s operational costs, the availability of
non-charge revenues, and the anticipated water usage in each zone. Based on that
evidence, the court concluded, the record demonstrated that the group of non-agricultural
water users, which includes Great Oaks, received substantial benefits from alternative
sources of water for the fiscal years at issue and in each zone, so it was reasonable to
impose some of the costs of those alternative sources on payors in that group via
volumetric charges.
       Lastly, the trial court held that the Open Space Credit imposed pursuant to the
District Act and water district policy does not violate the California Constitution because
the discount is not being paid for with the revenue from the charges levied on the non-

                                             15
agricultural pumpers. Instead, the discount is paid for completely by “other revenues”
from ad valorem property taxes and interest income.
       The trial court entered judgment on March 1, 2023. Great Oaks timely appealed.
                                         II. DISCUSSION
       Great Oaks argues on appeal that (1) the trial court erred by failing to make a
finding as to whether any exception to taxes under Proposition 26 applies to the
groundwater charges and, in fact, no exception applies; (2) the trial court failed to
perform a proper aggregate cost inquiry, instead improperly measuring the groundwater
charges for each year against the total costs of all water district activities for all water
programs, meaning groundwater charges could never be more than necessary to cover the
reasonable costs of the governmental activity; (3) the trial court failed to conduct a proper
allocation inquiry for numerous reasons; and (4) the Open Space Credit—the use of ad
valorem property taxes for the payment of agricultural groundwater charges—violates the
District Act and the California Constitution.
       The water district argues that (1) Great Oaks “waived”10 any argument that the
evidence is insufficient because it did not discuss the evidence supporting the trial court’s
factual determinations; (2) the trial court correctly found that groundwater charges are not
taxes under article XIII C of the California Constitution and thus do not require voter
approval; (3) substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that the water
district’s conjunctive use policy supports the reasonableness of charging groundwater
pumpers for some of the cost to provide alternative water supplies; (4) substantial
evidence supports the trial court’s finding that the aggregate revenue from groundwater
charges is less than the aggregate costs to provide service; (5) substantial evidence




        Although the water district contends Great Oaks “waived” this argument, the
       10

more accurate term is “forfeited.” (North American Title Company v. Superior Court of
Fresno County (2024) 17 Cal.5th 155, 177–178.)

                                               16
supports the trial court’s finding that the cost of the water program is fairly allocated
between rate payers; and (6) the Open Space Credit is legal.
       A. Applicable law
       Because Great Oaks’s arguments are primarily based on alleged violations of
Proposition 26, we begin with an overview of that proposition and the predecessor
propositions that gave rise to it. (See, e.g., Zolly v. City of Oakland (2022) 13 Cal.5th
780, 785 (Zolly) [to understand Proposition 26, “it is helpful to place it in the context of
other voter initiatives that have limited the ability of local governments to tax, beginning
in 1978 with the passage of Proposition 13”].)
              1. Proposition 13
       Passed in 1978, Proposition 13 added article XIII A to the California Constitution.
(San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1199.) Its purpose was to provide effective
real property tax relief through an “ ‘interlocking package’ ” of “ ‘a real property tax rate
limitation (art. XIII A, § 1), a real property assessment limitation (art. XIII A, § 2), a
restriction on state taxes (art. XIII A, § 3), and a restriction on local taxes (art. XIII A,
§ 4).’ ” (Id. at p. 1199, quoting Sinclair Paint Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1997) 
15Cal.4th 866, 872 (Sinclair Paint).)
       The main provisions of Proposition 13 capped ad valorem property taxes at one
percent of a property’s assessed value, and limited increases in assessed valuation to two
percent per year, unless and until the property changed hands. (San Buenaventura I,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1199, citing Cal. Const., art. XIII A, §§ 1, 2; Apartment Association
of Los Angeles County, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2001) 24 Cal.4th 830, 836 (Apartment
Association).) The initiative also prohibited counties, cities, and special districts from
enacting any “special tax” without a two-thirds votes of the electorate, “ ‘to prevent local
governments from subverting its limitations.’ ” (San Buenaventura I, supra, at p. 1199,
quoting Apartment Association, supra, at p. 836; Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 4.)



                                               17
              2. Proposition 218
       However, courts soon uniformly held that Proposition 13 did not prevent local
governments from imposing special assessments, or “ ‘charges levied on owners of real
property directly benefited by a local improvement to defray its costs.’ ” (San
Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at pp. 1199–1200, quoting Knox v. City of Orland
(1992) 4 Cal.4th 132, 141.)
       Largely as a result of that “perceived loophole,” voters passed Proposition 218 in
1996 to place analogous restrictions on assessments, fees, and charges. (San
Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1200.) Proposition 218 added article XIII D to the
California Constitution, which “ ‘imposes certain substantive and procedural restrictions
on taxes, assessments, fees, and charges ‘assessed by any agency upon any parcel of
property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership.’ ” (Id., quoting Cal.
Const., art. XIII D, § 3, subd. (a).) Article XIII D provides that the amount of a “ ‘fee or
charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not
exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.’ ” (Cal. Const., art.
XIII D, § 6, subd. (b)(3).)
       “Proposition 218 also added article XIII C, which restricts the authority of local
governments to impose taxes by, among other things, requiring voter approval of all taxes
imposed by local governments.” (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1200.)
“Article XIII C provides that all taxes imposed by local governments are either general
taxes or special taxes (art. XIII C, § 2, subd. (a)), and requires all general taxes to be
approved by a majority vote (art. XIII C, § 2, subd. (b)) and all special taxes to be
approved by a two-thirds vote (art. XIII C, § 2, subd. (d)).” (Id. at p. 1200, fn. 3.)
              3. Proposition 26
       Finally, in 2010, voters passed Proposition 26, “which further expanded the reach
of article XIII C’s voter approval requirement by broadening the definition of a tax to
include ‘any levy, charge, or exaction of any kind imposed by a local government.’ ”

                                              18
(San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1200, quoting Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1,
subd. (e); see also, Zolly, supra, 13 Cal.5th at p. 785 [because Prop. 218 did not define
what constitutes a tax, “[t]he electorate addressed that issue in 2010 with the enactment
of Proposition 26”].)
       Proposition 26’s findings declared that “ ‘California taxes have continued to
escalate,’ [and] ‘Californians are taxed at one of the highest levels of any state in the
nation.’ ” (City of Gridley v. Superior Court (2024) 104 Cal.App.5th 1201, 1211
(Gridley), citing Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 2010) text of Prop. 26,
§ 1, subds. (c), (e), & (f), p. 114.) The measure was therefore intended to restrict local
governments’ ability to increase taxes without voter approval, and “evinced a clear
concern about high tax burdens.” (Gridley, supra, at p. 1211, citing Humphreville v. City
of Los Angeles (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 115, 124.)
       However, Proposition 26 also included seven enumerated exceptions to the
definition of “tax” for certain types of exactions. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e).)
The first two exceptions, relevant to this appeal, are for (1) a “charge imposed for a
specific benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to
those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local
government of conferring the benefit or granting the privilege,” and (2) a “charge
imposed for a specific government service or product provided directly to the payor that
is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to
the local government of providing the service or product.” (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1,
subd. (e)(1), (2).)
       In addition, after the seven enumerated exceptions, the final paragraph of
subdivision (e) states: “The local government bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other exaction is not a tax, that the
amount is no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental
activity, and that the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or

                                              19
reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits received from, the
governmental activity.” (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e).)11
       B. Standard of review
       We independently review whether the groundwater charges fall within an article
XIII C, subdivision (e) exception. (Sutter’s Place, Inc. v. City of San Jose (2024) 104
Cal.App.5th 855, 863 (Sutter’s Place), citing San Buenaventura II, supra, 79 Cal.App.5th
at p. 119; see also, Griffith v. City of Santa Cruz (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 982 (Griffith);
San Diego County Water Authority v. Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
(2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1124; Newhall County Water District v. Castaic Lake Water
Agency (2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1430 (Newhall County).) When a trial court’s order
involves the interpretation and application of a constitutional provision, it raises questions
of law subject to independent review. (Prigmore v. City of Redding (2012) 
211Cal.App.4th 1322, 1333.)
       “When construing constitutional provisions and statutes, including those enacted
through voter initiative, we apply the same principles of interpretation.” (Loeber v.
Lakeside Joint School District (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 552, 580 (Loeber), citing
California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland (2017) 3 Cal.5th 924 (California
Cannabis).) “ ‘Our primary concern is giving effect to the intended purpose of the
provisions at issue.’ [Citation.] ‘When, as here, the voters enacted the provision, their
intent governs.’ ” (Loeber, supra, at p. 580, quoting Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency
v. Verjil (2006) 39 Cal.4th 205, 212. “To determine the voters’ intent, we analyze the
text of the provision in its relevant context, ‘ascribing to words their ordinary meaning’
and ‘taking account of related provisions and the structure of the relevant statutory and



       11
          “Proposition 26 also amended article XIII A to include a similar, though not
identical, definition and list of exemptions regarding what constitutes a tax imposed by
the state government.” (Zolly, supra, 13 Cal.5th at p. 786; Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 3.)

                                             20
constitutional scheme.’ ” (Loeber, supra, at p. 580, quoting California 
Cannabis, supra,at p. 933.)
       Nevertheless, in exercising our independent review, we “presume the appealed
judgment is correct and do not decide disputed issues of fact.” (San Buenaventura II,
supra, 104 Cal.App.5th at p. 863, citing Moore v. City of Lemon Grove (2015) 
237Cal.App.4th 363, 368–369.)
       Nor does the independent review standard “change the substantial evidence
standard of review [or] allow us to independently resolve issues of disputed fact already
decided by the trial court.” (San Buenaventura II, supra, 79 Cal.App.5th at p. 119.) “ ‘If
an appellant challenges a finding of fact, we must employ the substantial evidence
standard of review. As such, we are not concerned about a conflict in the evidence. …
“Rather, it is simply whether there is substantial evidence in favor of the respondent. If
this ‘substantial’ evidence is present, no matter how slight it may appear in comparison
with the contradictory evidence, the judgment must be upheld. As a general rule,
therefore, we will look only at the evidence and reasonable inferences supporting the
successful party, and disregard the contrary showing.” [Citation.]’ ” (Id. at pp. 119–120,
quoting Morgan v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 892, 917; Newhall
County, supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 1440.)
       C. Analysis
              1. Subdivision (e) exceptions to “tax”
       The first exception listed in article XIII C, section 1, subdivision (e), is for charges
“imposed for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is
not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the
local government of conferring the benefit or granting the privilege.” (Cal. Const., art.




                                              21
XIII C, § 1, subd. (e)(1).)12 The second exception is for charges “imposed for a specific
government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those
not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of
providing the service or product.” (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e)(2).)
        As we construe these provisions pursuant to our independent review, there are
multiple distinct requirements for a tax to qualify for one of the first two exceptions.
First, the charge must be a “specific benefit conferred,” a “privilege granted,” or a
“specific government service or product.”13 (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e)(1),
(2).)
        Second, the charge must have been “imposed.” (See, e.g., Zolly, supra, 13 Cal.5th
at p. 791 [in context of Constitution’s tax provisions, ordinary meaning of “impose” is “to
establish”]; Gridley, supra, 104 Cal.App.5th at p. 1210 [City did not “impose” its electric
rates at the relevant time because it had enacted them earlier].)
        Third, the benefit, privilege, or service must have been granted directly to the
payor and not provided to those not charged. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e)(1),
(2).)
        Fourth, the charge must not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of
conferring or providing the benefit, privilege, or service, which the government bears the
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1,
subd. (e)(1), (2).)
        And fifth, the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the
manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bears a fair or reasonable


        12
          The water district did not contend that the groundwater charges is not a “levy,
charge, or exaction of any kind imposed by a local government.” (See, e.g., Zolly, supra,
13 Cal.5th at p. 792 [“[h]aving determined that the challenged fees fall within Proposition
26’s general definition of a tax,” court then considered applicability of exceptions].)
       13
          For ease of reference, we refer to these hereafter as a “benefit,” “privilege,” or
“service.”

                                              22
relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental
activity. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e).)
       We address these in turn below.
                      (a) Benefit, privilege, or service
       Here, the water district grants Great Oaks the right to extract groundwater,
pursuant to its authority under the District Act. (§ 26.) Exercising our independent
review, we conclude that right constitutes a benefit, privilege, or a service. (See, e.g.,
San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at pp. 1210–1211 [charge imposed on well
operators was for privilege of extracting water from underground reserves]; Gov. Code,
§ 53758, subd. (a) [defining “specific benefit”], subd. (b) [defining “specific government
service”].)
       We need not decide here which of those labels fits best, because the remaining
requirements are the same. Whether it is a benefit, privilege, or service, it must be
provided directly to the payor and not to others not charged; it must not exceed the
reasonable costs to the local government of providing the benefit, privilege or service;
and the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor must bear a fair or
reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits received from, the
governmental activity. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e); San Buenaventura I,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1211 [“privilege,” “benefit” and “government service or product”
all subject to same set of requirements].)
       Significantly, Great Oaks does not argue that the right to extract groundwater is
not a specific benefit, privilege, or service. Instead, it argues only that the other
requirements of subdivision (e) are lacking. Accordingly, they have forfeited any such
argument. (See, e.g., Claudio v. Regents of the University of California (2005) 
134Cal.App.4th 224, 230 [review limited to issues adequately raised and briefed] (Claudio).)
       Great Oaks does argue that the trial court failed to make any finding altogether as
to which exception applies, which it claims constitutes error. However, we exercise de

                                               23
novo review here and reach our conclusion independent of what the trial court
determined.
                      (b) Provided directly to the payor and not to others not charged
       Great Oaks claims that the groundwater charges are levied to pay for the water
district’s groundwater program activities and a portion of its treated water, recycled water
and surface water program activities.14 According to Great Oaks, that constitutes a
“mixture of specific benefits to the payor and common benefits to both the payor and to
those not paying the Groundwater charge (i.e., all water users in general),” and therefore
does not qualify for an exception because it was imposed for something other than a
specific benefit conferred directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged.
In Great Oaks’s view, the purpose of the water district’s reallocation of program costs to
groundwater pumpers is not to provide a specific benefit to payors of the groundwater
charge that are not provided to those not charged, but instead is to provide common
benefits through an overall water management strategy, thereby disqualifying it from
falling under one of the first two exceptions.
       To the extent Great Oaks means to argue that the use of groundwater charge
revenues to fund non-groundwater program activities violates the “directly to the payor
that is not provided to those not charged” requirement, it is mistaken. (Cal. Const., art.
XIII C, § 1, subd. (e) (1), (2).) The plain language of this provision states that the test is
whether the benefit, privilege, or service itself is granted directly to the payor, or whether
it is also granted to others that are not charged. Here, the benefit, privilege, or service is
the right to extract groundwater, which is granted only to those who pay for that right,
such as Great Oaks. There is no evidence that the right to extract groundwater is granted
to any entity that is not charged for that right.

       14
         Because neither party has argued that the charge was not “imposed” on Great
Oaks by the water district, we do not address that requirement of article XIII C, section 1,
subdivision (e)(1) and (2).

                                               24
       The fact that the revenue derived from the groundwater charges may benefit others
does not alter this conclusion. In defining “specific benefit,” for instance, the
Government Code provides that “[a] specific benefit is not excluded from classification
as a ‘specific benefit’ merely because an indirect benefit to a nonpayor occurs
incidentally and without cost to the payor as a consequence of providing the specific
benefit to the payor.” (Gov. Code, § 53758, subd. (a).)
       Lastly, to the extent Great Oaks means to argue that the use of groundwater charge
revenues to fund non-groundwater program activities violates the requirement that the
charge not exceed the reasonable costs to the government of providing the benefit,
product, or service, we address that contention in the following section.

                      (c) Aggregate cost inquiry
       Great Oaks next challenges the aggregate cost inquiry, or the requirement that the
water district prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount charged is no
more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity.
       As a preliminary matter, we note that subdivision (e) includes similar language
regarding “reasonable costs” in two different locations. First, exceptions (1) and (2)
include the requirement that the charge “not exceed the reasonable costs to the local
government” of providing the benefit, privilege, or service. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1,
subd. (e)(1), (2).) Second, the final, unnumbered, paragraph of subdivision (e) provides
that the government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that
“the amount is no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental
activity.” (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e).)
       We need not address the interplay between those two provisions here, however,
because the California Supreme Court has held that the second of those provisions
establishes the aggregate cost inquiry, and Great Oaks does not argue that the language




                                               25
within exceptions (1) and (2) imposes a separate or different requirement that was
unsatisfied here. (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1212.)
       Beginning with the plain language of the final paragraph of article XIII C, section
1, subdivision (e), we recognize, as the trial court did, that it contains two undefined
terms about which the parties disagreed. The first term, which is not at issue in this
appeal is the relevant “charge” levied by the government. In the trial court, Great Oaks
argued that the relevant charge was limited to what it challenges in this lawsuit—the non-
agricultural groundwater charges in each particular zone. The water district argued that
the relevant charge was all water charges—including but not limited to groundwater
charges—across both zones. The trial court agreed with Great Oaks on this point and
held that the relevant charges are the non-agricultural groundwater charges only,
separately evaluated for each zone.
       The second term, which is at issue in this appeal, is the “reasonable costs of the
governmental activity.” Great Oaks argued in the trial court that the governmental
activity should be limited to non-agricultural groundwater program activities, and not
include any other aspects of the water utility’s overall water management program, such
as activities related to imported, treated, or recycled water. The water district argued that
the governmental activity should include all actions it takes to protect, augment, and
maintain the groundwater supply, which includes the entirety of the water utility’s
program activities.
       The trial court agreed with the water district and held that the entire water utility
program counts as the relevant governmental activity because the whole program “is
aimed, in some fashion, toward its mission of preserving and distributing groundwater,”
and is necessary to provide Great Oaks and other pumpers access to groundwater. The
court noted that the water district’s conjunctive use management policy as a whole helps
preserve groundwater and maintain the health of the basin, and that capital projects
relating to water supply also benefit groundwater production and preservation. The trial

                                             26
court relied on case law under both Proposition 218 and Proposition 26, which it found
has taken “a broad view of the costs needed to provide the ‘government activity’ at
issue.”
          As the trial court explained its holding, it broadly characterized water district
actions which were not themselves groundwater pumping—such as importing and
treating water—as actions that “materially enhance the District’s groundwater
preservation and distribution program.” The court deemed the water district’s
conjunctive use approach to groundwater management to be reasonable because “overall
supply reliability is increased by managing [the] groundwater subbasins and maximizing
the District’s influence over other components of water supply.” In addition, “managing
surface water, imported water, treated water, water conservation, groundwater recharge,
recycling, local surface storage, and water banking in a collective fashion decreases
overall vulnerability to the risk of groundwater overdraft and depletion.”
          Great Oaks argues that the trial court’s ruling “defies… the applicable law.” First,
Great Oaks contends that, pursuant to the plain language of article XIII C, section 1,
subdivision (e), “if a charge is imposed for non-specific or common benefits that are
provided to a payor of the charge that is also provided to those not charged, the charge
cannot qualify as an exception to taxes under subd. (e)(1).” It cites the trial court’s
finding that the groundwater charge pays for activities of “common benefit to all waters
users,” and argues it shows that the groundwater “charge does not provide a specific
benefit to Great Oaks that is not provided to those not charged.”
          Great Oaks misconstrues article XIII C, section 1, subdivision (e). As explained
above, the benefit, privilege, or service provided directly to Great Oaks here is the right
to extract groundwater, which is not provided to anyone not paying the groundwater
charges. By contrast, the benefits that result from imposition of the groundwater
charges—here, the overall water management program and enhancement of the
groundwater basins—need not be limited to the payors of the charge. Instead, the

                                                27
aggregate cost inquiry mandates only that the charge not exceed the reasonable costs of
the governmental activity. That test is satisfied here.
       Great Oaks argues that the “broad view” the trial court took of the costs needed to
provide the governmental activity at issue is not supported by the case law. It cites San
Buenaventura I, arguing that, although the water agency in that case both managed
groundwater and reduced demand for groundwater by delivering water from other
sources, “the charges for those pipeline deliveries of alternative water supplies were not
considered or even discussed, and certainly were not part of the costs” of the relevant
governmental activity included in the aggregate cost inquiry.
       Great Oaks misreads San Buenaventura I. The California Supreme Court did not
conduct an aggregate cost inquiry at all in that case—instead, it merely held that the
aggregate cost inquiry and the allocation inquiry were distinct steps in the analysis, and
that the court of appeal had failed to conduct the latter. (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3
Cal.5th at p. 1212.) Nothing in San Buenaventura I stands for the proposition that the
relevant “governmental activity” must be circumscribed and may not include broader
program management activities.
       Great Oaks also objects to the trial court’s reliance on Citizens for Fair REU Rates
v. City of Redding (2018) 6 Cal.5th 1, which it cited as an example of a case that took a
broad view of the costs needed to provide the governmental activity at issue, and which
held that “the reasonable costs include expenditures to generate and acquire electricity
and other costs typical of utility operations.” (Id. at pp. 15–16.) Great Oaks argues the
case is inapposite because the “ ‘other costs of utility operations’[ ] only involved costs of
general government administrative services provided by the [city] to its own electric
utility, and those ‘other costs’ did not increase electric rates.” We need not address the
extent to which the facts of that case are analogous, though, as the trial court cited it only
for the general proposition that courts may take a “broad view” of the costs of the
governmental activity.

                                              28
       We have read and considered the other cases cited by Great Oaks, and we are not
persuaded that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard by taking a “broad view”
of the costs needed to provide the relevant governmental activity.
       Having concluded that the trial court applied a correct legal standard, we similarly
conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that the relevant
governmental activity in this case is the entirety of the water utility’s program activities
in each zone. For example, the record shows that the water district treats water as a
fungible commodity via its conjunctive use policy, which it has maintained since the
1930s. This coordinated use of groundwater and surface water resources maximizes
water supply reliability, allowing the water district “to store surface water in local
groundwater basins to help balance pumping and provide reserves for use during dry
years when surface water availability is limited.” It helps protect against groundwater
overdraft and land subsidence, prevent saltwater intrusion, and enhance natural recharge.
As a result, “the overall reliability of the water supply system is greatly enhanced when
all of the components are combined to complete the water supply picture.” Without the
in-lieu recharge activities, the users of treated water and recycled water might otherwise
use groundwater.
       A 1975 study performed by the water district found that importing water
substantially benefits groundwater pumpers by reducing demands on the groundwater
subbasins. In addition, in 2011 the water district commissioned a study by a consultant,
which concluded that groundwater pumpers in both zones benefit more from the
conjunctive use policy than they pay out in allocated costs of treated or recycled water.
The study confirmed that by recharging groundwater basins with other types of water and
providing alternative, non-groundwater sources of water to customers, the groundwater
basins will be preserved, thereby helping groundwater pumpers as a group.




                                             29
       In sum, substantial evidence supports the trial court’s conclusion that “it makes
sense to count the entirety of the Water Utility’s work as a ‘relevant governmental
activity.’ ”
       Great Oaks argues that the trial court’s “expansive interpretation” of the relevant
governmental activity subverts the intended taxpayer protections of Proposition 26
because, under this standard, the total revenues from the groundwater charge will never
exceed the total costs of all governmental activities. However, that is not necessarily true
and, even if it were, it would not establish a violation of article XIII C, section 1,
subdivision (e). First, if the water district were to increase the groundwater charge, but
without any corresponding increase in the total costs of all relevant governmental
activities, the revenues theoretically could exceed the costs, in which case the charge
would constitute a tax pursuant to subdivision (e). Second, the costs component remains
subject to a reasonableness standard under the final paragraph of subdivision (e). And
third, in scenarios such as this where the relevant governmental activities are so
interconnected with one another that they may all be essential to providing the benefit,
privilege, or service to the payor, and cannot be fairly segregated, it is likely the
reasonable costs will exceed the revenues from the groundwater charges. (See, e.g.,
California Association of Professional Scientists v. Department of Fish & Game (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 935, 950 (Professional Scientists) [regulatory fees are often not easily
correlated to a specific ascertainable cost].) Great Oaks has not cited any authority
suggesting that Proposition 26 precludes such scenarios.
       Having concluded that substantial evidence supports the trial court’s determination
of the “relevant governmental activity,” we similarly review the trial court’s subsequent
finding that the water district proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the non-
agricultural groundwater charges do not exceed the reasonable costs of that activity. As
explained above, the trial court compared, on a zone-by-zone and year-by-year basis, the
non-agricultural groundwater charge revenues with the program costs of the entire water

                                              30
utility program, and determined—based on the financial numbers from the water
district’s reports—that they satisfied the aggregate cost inquiry.
       Great Oaks does not challenge that substantial evidence. Indeed, given Great
Oaks’s position that the trial court’s expansive definition of “relevant governmental
activity” means the groundwater charges will never exceed the total costs, it would be
difficult for Great Oaks to mount a substantial evidence challenge to this step of the
aggregate cost inquiry, which is essentially a balance sheet comparing groundwater
charges to total costs of the entire water utility program.
       Great Oaks instead points to evidence in the record it submitted at trial showing
what that balance sheet would look like if groundwater charges were compared only to
“project costs allocated to Groundwater.” The argument fails, though, because the
relevant governmental activities are not limited here to project costs allocated only to
groundwater. In addition, we are not concerned here about a conflict in the evidence, but
rather only about whether there is substantial evidence in favor of the respondent. (San
Buenaventura II, supra, 79 Cal.App.5th at p. 119 [if substantial evidence is present, no
matter how slight in comparison with contradictory evidence, the judgment must be
upheld].) “As a general rule, therefore, we will look only at the evidence and reasonable
inferences supporting the successful party, and disregard the contrary showing.”
[Citation.]’ ” (Id. at pp. 119–120.)

                     (d) Allocation inquiry – legal determinations
       Subdivision (e) of article XIII C, section 1, imposes a separate requirement that
the local government prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the manner in which
the costs of the governmental activity are allocated to a payor bears a fair or reasonable
relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental
activity. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, § 1, subd. (e).) In other words, the amount charged to
a payor like Great Oaks generally must be proportional to the benefits the payor receives



                                             31
from, or the burden it imposes on, the governmental activity. As the California Supreme
Court explained in San Buenaventura I, this language in Proposition 26 was “drawn in
large part from pre-Proposition 26 case law distinguishing between taxes subject to the
requirements of article XIII A[,] … on the one hand, and regulatory and other fees, on the
other.” (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1210, citing Jacks v. City of Santa
Barbara (2017) 3 Cal.5th 248, 262.)
       The Supreme Court had described that distinction in Sinclair Paint, “which
concerned the proper categorization of fees imposed on manufacturers of lead-containing
products (and others) to raise revenue for a statewide lead poisoning evaluation,
screening, and follow[-]up program.” (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1210,
citing Sinclair Paint, supra, 15 Cal.4th 866.) As the Court explained, “ ‘[i]n general,
taxes are imposed for revenue purposes, rather than in return for a specific benefit
conferred or privilege granted,’ ” and “a fee does not become a tax unless it ‘ “ ‘exceed[s]
the reasonable cost of providing services … for which the fee is charged.’ ” ’ ” (San
Buenaventura, supra, at p. 1201, quoting Sinclair Paint, supra, 15 Cal.4th at pp. 874–
876.) In addition, the government must prove “ ‘the basis for determining the manner in
which the costs are apportioned, so that charges allocated to a payor bear a fair or
reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on or benefits from the regulatory
activity.’ ” (Sinclair Paint, supra, at p. 878, quoting San Diego Gas & Electric Company
v. San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1132, 1146.)
“Proposition 26 codified both requirements.” (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p.
1210.)15


       15
           Identical language also appears in another provision of the California
Constitution regarding fees imposed by the state. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, § 3, subd. (d);
see, e.g., California Building Industry Association v. State Water Resources Control
Board (2018) 4 Cal.5th 1032, 1052 [“[s]o long as ‘there is a reasonable basis in the
record for the manner in which the fee is allocated among those responsible for paying
it,’ a regulatory fee will not be deemed an unconstitutional tax under article XIII A”].)

                                             32
       This “pre-Proposition 26 case law made clear that, ‘[i]n pursuing a constitutionally
and statutorily mandated conservation program, cost allocations for services provided are
to be judged by a standard of reasonableness with some flexibility permitted to account
for system-wide complexity.’ ” (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1210, quoting
Brydon v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 178, 193 (Brydon).)
       As summarized above, the trial court found that the water district’s non-
agricultural groundwater charges had been reasonably allocated on a volumetric basis
across the thousands of non-agricultural groundwater pumpers who are water district
customers, and that Great Oaks is within the group of payers that receive a significant
benefit from the conjunctive use policy and overall water management program.
       That ultimate factual finding was predicated on three preliminary legal
determinations the trial court made regarding issues the parties disputed. First, the trial
court held that the allocation analysis does not need to be made on an individualized
payor-by-payor basis, but instead may be measured collectively, considering all rate
payors. Second, the trial court held that a government agency may allocate the costs of
alternative water supplies to the group of groundwater extractors, in a fair and reasonable
manner, if those alternative water supplies provide significant benefits to the group.
Third, the trial court held that volumetric charges are a permissible method of allocating
costs if they are being imposed on reasonably similar payors.
       Great Oaks first challenges these legal determinations, which we review de novo.
(San Buenaventura II, supra, 79 Cal.App.5th at p. 118.)
                            (i)     Individual vs. group payor analysis
       The California Supreme Court has held that a “regulatory fee does not become a
tax simply because the fee may be disproportionate to the service rendered to individual
payors.” (California Farm Bureau Federation v. State Water Resources Control Board
(2011) 51 Cal.4th 421, 428 (Farm Bureau), citing Brydon, supra, 24 Cal.App.4th p. 194.)
“The question of proportionality is not measured on an individual basis. Rather, it is

                                             33
measured collectively, considering all rate payors.” (Farm Bureau, supra, at p. 428,
citing Professional Scientists, supra, 79 Cal.App.4th at p. 948.) “A fee is valid if there is
a reasonable basis in the record for the allocation. [Citation.] The record need only
demonstrate a reasonable relationship, not an exact relationship. Courts employ a
‘ “flexible assessment of proportionality within a broad range of reasonableness” ’ in
determining the constitutionality of fees.” (American Coatings Association, Inc. v. State
Air Resources Board (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 1111, 1128.)
       Great Oaks does not address any of this authority. Instead, it argues that the plain
language of the allocation inquiry portion of article XIII C, section 1, subdivision (e)
requires the examination of each individual payor’s burdens on, or benefits received
from, the governmental activity. Great Oaks notes that the constitutional provision uses
the word “payor” in the singular: “The language of the ‘allocation analysis’ involves an
individual ‘payor’ of the charge.”
       We do not read article XIII C, section 1, subdivision (e) in that manner. The
relevant language—“the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor”—does not
preclude a collective approach to the analysis. More importantly, though, the wealth of
case law summarized above has interpreted the language to the contrary, and Great Oaks
has not persuaded us to depart from it.
       Great Oaks cites Newhall County in support of its position. In that case, the court
held that, “in the context of wholesale water rates to four water agencies,” the allocation
inquiry “necessarily requires evaluation on a ‘purveyor by purveyor’ basis.” (Newhall
County, supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 1446.) However, the case is inapposite here, where
there are thousands of customers, not four. Even the court in Newhall County recognized
that in cases involving “large numbers of payors, who could rationally be (and were)




                                             34
placed in different usage categories, justifying different fees for different classes of
payors,” a collective approach would make sense. (Id. at pp. 1442, 1446.)16
       Lastly, Great Oaks claims that the trial court’s finding here “would effectively
eliminate individual consideration of a taxpayer in a challenge to fees or charges levied
by a local government on that taxpayer.” We do not agree with that assessment. First,
the trial court held, as we do, only that the allocation inquiry does not need to be done on
a payor-by-payor basis in every instance—it did not determine that the inquiry must
always be done collectively. Second, the case law discussed above demonstrates that the
nature of the allocation inquiry will be context specific.
                             (ii)   Allocation of costs of alternative water supplies
       The trial court held that “the costs of significant benefits of the relevant
government activity [may] be allocated to payors … [i]f there is a reasonable basis in the
record to find that a local government activity benefits, in some material way, the group
of users of which the payor is a member,” provided that the allocation is done in a fair
and reasonable manner. For that reason, “even if a groundwater extractor doesn’t have
these alternative supplies of water piped by the local agency to its location for use, that
extractor—and the entire class of extractors—still receives a substantial benefit from
these activities.”
       In our view, this step in the analysis is unnecessary because it was already
established when defining the scope of the relevant governmental activity. In other
words, because the relevant governmental activity here includes the entirety of the water

       16
         A different panel of this court recently cited Newhall County approvingly as
support for its determination that the trial court in its case had properly engaged “in an
individual evaluation of regulatory benefits and burdens.” (Sutter’s Place, supra, 104
Cal.App.5th at p. 865.) However, Sutter’s Place dealt with a different exception—
subdivision (e)(3)—which “describes activities of an individual rather than programmatic
nature.” (Id. at p. 864.) In addition, the case contained only two payors, a similarly
narrow class as in Newhall County. (Id. at p. 865.)


                                              35
utility’s work, under the plain language of article XIII C, section 1, subdivision (e), it is
the manner in which those costs are allocated which must bear a fair and reasonable
relationship to the payor’s burdens or benefits.
       Great Oaks argues that “[p]roviding alternative water supplies to other water users
does not eliminate the required ‘allocation analysis.’ ” We agree that the allocation
inquiry is still required—however, we do not interpret the trial court as having held to the
contrary and, in fact, it proceeded to conduct the allocation inquiry, as we discuss below.
       Great Oaks similarly argues that “[n]either the law nor substantial evidence
supports the trial court’s finding that the [consultant] reports supporting the District’s
‘conjunctive use’ policy eliminates the required ‘allocation analysis’ in these cases,” and
that “[s]tatutory authority for comprehensive water management does not eliminate the
required ‘allocation analysis.’ ” We reject these arguments for the same reason—the trial
court did conduct the allocation inquiry.
                             (iii)   Volumetric charges
       The trial court held that volumetric, or volume-based, charges are a permissible
method of allocating costs if they are being imposed on reasonably similar payors
because the “local governmental agency has some discretion on how it allocates costs if
there is ‘a reasonable basis in the record for the allocation.’ ” In the trial court’s view, a
volumetric charge is a “reasonable, easily-administrable measure for how much benefit a
payor receives from the government program,” because “the more water pumped, the
more benefit a payor would receive from a local government agency designed to
preserve, obtain, and deliver that water.”
       Great Oaks argues that this approach is directly contrary to the holding in San
Buenaventura I, in which the California Supreme Court remanded for further proceedings
“in part because the ‘volumetric’ analysis by the Court of Appeal did not answer the
question presented in the required ‘allocation analysis,’ namely whether ‘the manner in
which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the

                                              36
payor’s burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental activity.’ ” (San
Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1212.)
       Great Oaks misreads the trial court’s ruling. The court did not hold that the use of
volumetric charges obviates the need to conduct the allocation inquiry or satisfies the
inquiry by itself. Nor did the trial court hold that volumetric charges will necessarily be a
satisfactory approach in every case. Instead, the trial court held only that the use of
volumetric charges is acceptable if they are being imposed on reasonably similar payors
and there is a reasonable basis in the record for the allocation. As the court expressly
stated, “[t]he Court agrees that volumetric charges may or may not fairly allocate costs,
depending on the facts.”
       San Buenaventura I did not hold to the contrary. It simply held that the court of
appeal had failed to “consider whether the record sufficiently establishes that the
District's rates for the [relevant] water years bore a reasonable relationship to the burdens
on or the benefits of its conservation activities.” (San Buenaventura I, supra, 3 Cal.5th at
p. 1214.)
                     (e) Allocation inquiry – factual determinations
       Having properly made those threshold legal determinations, the trial court then
applied those principles to conduct the allocation inquiry. Among other things, the trial
court found that the water district has thousands of customers in different usage
categories, so that it is reasonable not to set payor-by-payor rates for customers. As we
have explained above, substantial evidence supports that finding in the form of the water
district’s own annual reports as well as their consultants’ reports.
       The trial court also found that there was “substantial, unrebutted evidence in the
record that providing alternative sources of water to some (but not all) groundwater
pumpers reduces overdrafting and maintains the supply for other pumpers in the [water]
district.” As evidentiary support, the trial court cited the water district’s 1975 study and
the 2011 consultant study, “which found that importing water substantially benefits

                                             37
groundwater pumpers by reducing demands on the water district’s groundwater
subbasins.”
       Next the trial court found that the record supported “the propriety of allocating
some costs of treated and recycled water to groundwater pumpers, even ones who don’t
use treated or recycled water,” based on the 2011 consultant study’s conclusion that
groundwater pumpers in both zones “benefit more from this policy than they pay out in
allocated costs of treated/recycled water.”
       Finally, the trial court found that the water district had “already grouped similarly-
situated groundwater pumpers together—that’s how zones were created and defined.”
The evidence in the record, including the pricing policy and the reports demonstrating
how the rates were determined each year, showed that the water district set the
groundwater charges based on numerous factors, including “the zone’s operational costs,
the availability of non-charge revenues (which typically are applied to offset operational
costs before any charge setting occurs), the anticipated water usage in that zone, and so
on.”
       We conclude that the evidence cited by the trial court constitutes substantial
evidence supporting its findings here.
       Great Oaks argues that “[t]he notion that all groundwater pumpers in a zone are
‘similarly situated’ is … belied by the fact that there are known and obvious differences
related to pumpers even within the groundwater subbasin.” It cites the water district’s
2016 groundwater management plan, which allegedly details “the many differences
existing throughout the Santa Clara subbasin,” and the various subbasins that exist within
the two zones.
       However, the evidence does not purport to show that all groundwater pumpers are
identically situated—only similarly situated. Moreover, the evidence shows the water
district set the groundwater charges based on numerous factors, including the zone’s
operational costs, the availability of non-charge revenues, and the anticipated water usage

                                              38
in a zone. Great Oaks has not demonstrated that this evidence is not substantial, and “we
will look only at the evidence and reasonable inferences supporting the successful party,
and disregard the contrary showing.” (San Buenaventura II, supra, 79 Cal.App.5th at pp.
119–120.)17
              2. Agricultural discount and Open Space Credit
       As Great Oaks acknowledges, the water district uses ad valorem taxes received
from the County to fund the Open Space Credit—that is, the significant discount given to
agricultural groundwater pumpers. Great Oaks contends that this practice violates the
District Act and the California Constitution.
       First, Great Oaks argues that the water district “does not and cannot levy ad
valorem taxes on an annual basis or otherwise. Ad valorem taxes can only be levied by
the County of Santa Clara.” Great Oaks’s argument here is difficult to decipher. It
correctly states that the water district does not levy ad valorem taxes—instead, the
County levies them and gives a portion to the district. Thus, the water district did not
violate any prohibition against levying ad valorem taxes itself.
       Great Oaks also argues that the water district’s use of ad valorem taxes to fund the
Open Space Credit violates section 26.7, subdivision (c), of the District Act, which
provides that “[a]ny groundwater charge levied pursuant to this section shall be in
addition to any general tax or assessment levied within the district or any zone or zones

       17
          Great Oaks makes a similar argument based on section 26.7 of the District Act
which, among other things, provides that a groundwater charge “shall be computed at a
fixed and uniform rate or rates per acre-foot for agricultural water, and at a fixed and
uniform rate or rates per acre-foot for all water other than agricultural water.” (§ 26.7,
subd. (a)(3)(A).) According to Great Oaks, “[a]ny charge imposed under a statute or
resolution requiring a set pricing formula, such as the uniform rate required by Section
26.7(a)(3)(A), without the allocation analysis, is invalid on its face.” Great Oaks
therefore argues that “trial court’s approval of the District’s uniform zone-wide
groundwater charge without evidence of the mandatory allocation analysis, is reversible
error.” Again, though, the trial court did conduct an allocation inquiry, so Great Oaks’s
argument fails.

                                            39
thereof.” (§ 26.7, subd. (c).) According to Great Oaks, the water district uses ad valorem
taxes in lieu of groundwater charges, rather than “in addition to,” a term Great Oaks
argues means “over and above,” based on a dictionary definition.
       We are unpersuaded. As we read this section, it appears to mean that the
imposition of a groundwater charge does not offset or exempt a payor from ad valorem
taxes, to which it is still subject. In any case, Great Oaks has not provided any legal
authority in support of its construction.
       Finally, Great Oaks argues that the use of ad valorem taxes for the special benefit
of agriculture directly violates the California Constitution. For support, Great Oaks cites
Silicon Valley Taxpayers’ Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County (2008) 44 Cal.4th 431,
which stated: “ ‘The rationale of special assessment[s] is that the assessed property has
received a special benefit over and above that received by the general public. The general
public should not be required to pay for special benefits for the few, and the few specially
benefitted should not be subsidized by the general public. [Citation.]’ ”
       As the trial court correctly explained, though, that case “deal[t] with special
assessments, not a decision by a local government agency on how to spend money
allocated to it.” The case is inapposite and we reject Great Oaks’s argument here.
                                      III.   DISPOSITION
       The judgment is affirmed. The water district may recover its costs on appeal.

          Defendant and Respondent.

        BY THE COURT:
        It is ordered that the opinion filed herein on February 28, 2025, be modified as
follows:
        On page 2, the first sentence of the final paragraph shall now read:
        “We conclude the groundwater charges levied against Great Oaks are not “taxes”
because they fall under exceptions set out in Proposition 26 for a specific benefit
conferred or privilege granted, or a specific government service or product provided
directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C, §
1, subd. (e)(1), (2).)”
        On page 33, the second full paragraph shall now read:
        “As summarized above, the trial court found that the water district’s non-
agricultural groundwater charges had been reasonably allocated on a volumetric basis
across the thousands of non-agricultural groundwater pumpers who are water district


                                              1
customers, and that Great Oaks is within the group of payors that receive a significant
benefit from the conjunctive use policy and overall water management program.”


       There is no change in the judgment. The petition for rehearing is denied.

                  OPINION BY ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE SWEET
                  ON THE GOVERNMENT'S MOTION TO DISMISS
                         FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION

       The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) moves to dismiss this appeal for lack of
jurisdiction on the basis that Military Aircraft Parts (MAP) failed to timely appeal from a
contract termination for default and from a final decision denying MAP's claim arising from
the cancellation of a purchase order. We grant DLA's motion in part, and deny it in part.

          STATEMENT OF FACTS (SOF) FOR PURPOSES OF THE MOTION

       1. DLA and MAP entered into Contract No. SPM4A7-08-M-4911 (contract 4911)
on 22 January 2008 for 79 aircraft fairings in support of the F-15 aircraft with first article
due by 28 December 2008 and production quantities by 24 October 2009 (R4, tab A-1).
DLA unilaterally issued Purchase Order No. SPM4A7-10-M-B971 (purchase order
B971) 1 to MAP on 3 May 2010 for similar aircraft fairings with first article due by
2 August 2010 and production quantities by 28 February 2011 (R4, tab B-1).



1   We do not take a position on whether the unilateral purchase order ripened into a
        contract. See DODS, Inc., ASBCA No. 57817, 12-2 BCA ~ 35,083 (explaining the
        conditions upon which unilateral purchase orders ripen into contracts).
        2. By letter dated 10 January 2013, the contracting officer (CO) issued a final
decision (2013 COFD) terminating contract 4911 for default for ""failure to deliver the
supplies in accordance with the established delivery schedule"" (R4, tab A-4 at 1). The 2013
COFD notified MAP of its right to appeal the decision to the Board within 90 days of
receipt, or to bring an action directly in the United States Court of Federal Claims within
12 months of receipt (id.).

       3. MAP received the 2013 COFD by certified mail on 14 January 2013 (gov't
mot., ex. F).

       4. By Modification No. POOOOl, signed on 11 January 2013, the CO withdrew purchase
order B971 because delivery of the supplies was not made by the required date (R4, tab B-2).

       5. By letter dated 1 June 2015, MAP submitted a claim for $17,582.08 to the CO
under both contract 4911 and purchase order B97 l (R4, tab A-5). MAP alleged that the CO
""impeded MAP's ability to complete FAT [first article] testing,"" 2 and ""failed to use
discretion in the application of Termination for Default, despite excusable reasons for failure
and failure to conditionally approve a FAT with minor defects shown likely to be correctable
in production through the efforts of the accord and satisfaction"" (id. at 5).

        6. By letter dated 31 July 2015, the CO stated that no final decision would be issued
on the contract 4911 claim because contract 4911 ""was properly terminated for default over
two years ago"" (R4, tab A-6 at 9). However, the CO issued a final decision (2015 COFD)
for the purchase order B971 claim (id. at 9-10). The CO denied the purchase order B971
claim (id.). The 2015 COFD notified MAP of its right to appeal the decision on the
purchase order B971 claim to the Board within 90 days of receipt, or to bring an action
directly in the Court of Federal Claims within 12 months of receipt (id. at 10).

        7. The government sent the 2015 COFD via email to MAP on 31 July 2015 (R4,
tab A-6). However, there is no evidence as to when MAP received that email. The
government subsequently sent a copy of the 2015 COFD via certified mail to MAP's
mailing address in Rancho Cordova, California (R4, tab A-7). The post office in Rancho
Cordova received the 2015 COFD on 7 August 2015, but the document could not be
delivered to MAP because no authorized recipient was available during delivery attempts
(id. at 3). On 8 September 2015, the post office returned the 2015 COFD to the
government after the expiration of the maximum hold time (id.).



2   Purchase order B97 l states that ""[ c ]onsideration will be given to waiver of first article
        provisions in this order upon approval of first article in order SPM4A 7-08-M-491 l
        [contract]"" (R4, tab B-1 at 2). Therefore, issues with first article testing affected
        both contract 4911 and purchase order B971.
                                                2
       8. On 2 November 2015, MAP filed with the Board its appeal from the 2015 COFD,
and from a ""deemed denial"" of the contract 4911 claim.

                                      DISCUSSION

        The Board does not possess jurisdiction over DLA' s contract 4911 claim, but there is
insufficient evidence at this point to show that the Board does not possess jurisdiction over
DLA's purchase order B971 claim. ""A contractor, within 90 days from the date of receipt
of a contracting officer's decision ... may appeal the decision to an agency board."" 41 U.S.C.
§ 7104. The Board does not possess jurisdiction over any appeal filed outside of this 90-day
appeal period. Cosmic Construction Co. v. United States, 697 F.2d 1389, 1390-91 (Fed.
Cir. 1982); see also 41 U.S.C. § 7103(g) (""The contracting officer's decision on a claim is
final and conclusive and is not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, or Federal

received, but the burden of proof is on appellant to establish that its appeal was timely
filed."" TTF, LLC, ASBCA No. 59511 et al., 15-1 BCA ~ 35,883 at 175,434. The burden on
appellant can be met by affidavit or other evidence. Bearing and Drive Systems, Inc.,

       I. MAP 's Contract 4911 Claim is Untimely

       MAP's appeal under the contract is untimely. MAP received the 2013 COFD
regarding MAP's contract 4911 claim on 14 January 2013 (SOF ~ 3). It did not file its
appeal until 2 November 2015-more than 90 days after receipt of the 2013 COFD
(SOF ~ 8). Therefore, we do not possess jurisdiction over MAP' s contract 4911 claim.

        MAP argues that section 7104's 90-day statute of limitations to appeal a COFD to the
Board is not jurisdictional under Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. v. United States, 773 F .3d 1315
(Fed. Cir. 2014). However, Sikorsky held that a different statute of limitations-namely the
six-year statute of limitations to file a claim with the CO under 41 U.S.C. § 7103(a)(4)(A}-is
not jurisdictional. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has not
extended Sikorsky to the 90-day statute of limitations under section 7104. Cf Guardian
Angels Med. Service Dogs, Inc. v. United States, 809 F.3d 1244, 1252 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
(declining to reach the issue of whether the 12-month statute of limitations to appeal a COFD
to the United States Court of Federal Claims is jurisdictional). Absent such an extension,
we-and the other Boards of Contract Appeals-have continued to follow the holding in
Cosmic Construction that section 7104' s 90-day statute of limitations is jurisdictional, even
after Sikorsky. Military Aircraft Parts, ASBCA No. 60139, 16-1 BCA ~ 36,390 at 177,423,
recon. denied, slip op. (21 Feb. 2017); see also Estes Bros. Constr. Inc. v. DOT, CBCA
No. 4963, 15-1BCA~36,166; Finkle v. USPS, PSBCA No. 6540, 15-1BCA~35,927.



                                             3
       Nor can MAP rely upon the purported fact that its claims under the contract were
stand-alone claims against the government, instead of defenses to the termination for
default. MAP's claims were ""an implicit challenge to COFDs that were not timely
appealed"" and thus the Board lacks jurisdiction over MAP's claim. Military Aircraft Parts,
16-1BCA,36,390 at 177,425. In this appeal, MAP's contract 4911 claim is an even more
explicit challenge to a COFD that was not timely appealed (SOF , 5). MAP acknowledged
this when it stated in its claim that it is challenging the CO's discretion in terminating the
contract for default (id.). Thus, we do not possess jurisdiction over MAP's claim under
contract 4911.

       II. MAP 's Purchase Order B971 Claim is Timely

        The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing the date MAP
received the 2015 COFD on its purchase order B97 l claim. The government first points
to the 31 July 2015 email. However, ""[t]he contracting officer shall furnish a copy of the
[final] decision to the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any
other method that provides evidence of receipt."" FAR 33.21 l(b). Thus, the government
must provide ""objective indicia of receipt."" Riley & Ephriam Constr. Co. v. United
States, 408 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (holding that evidence that the government
transmitted a fax was insufficient to show receipt of that fax). As with the fax in Riley
& Ephriam, while there is evidence that the government transmitted the 2015 COFD via
email on 31July2015, there is no objective indicia that MAP received the 2015 COFD
on that date (SOF, 7). Cf Trygve Dale Westergard v. GSA, CBCA No. 2522, 11-2 BCA
, 34,842 at 171,394.

        The government argues that MAP must have received the 31 July 2015 email
because it appealed the 2015 COFD attached to that email. That inference is sound.
However, it sheds no light upon the relevant issue of when MAP received the email.
Absent such evidence, we cannot determine whether MAP filed its appeal within 90 days of
its receipt of the 2015 COFD.

       The government also argues that MAP admitted in its complaint that it received
the 2015 COFD on 31July2015. However, the complaint alleges that ""[o]n 31July2015
DLA Branch Chief Janice Hicks issued a Contracting Officer's Final Decision (COFD)
stating the termination for default would not be revisited and the claim under [purchase]
order SPM4A7-10-M-B671 was denied"" (compl., 23). Thus, the complaint merely
alleges that the COFD is dated 31July2015, not that MAP received the 2015 COFD on
31 July 2015.

      The government also points to the copy of the 2015 COFD that it sent by certified
mail. However, the Rancho Cordova post office did not receive the certified mail until



                                             4
7 August 2015 (SOF     ~   7). MAP filed this appeal less than 90 days later, on 2 November
2015 (SOF ~ 8). 3

       Therefore, the government has failed to meet its burden, and we find that MAP is
timely in its appeal of the 2015 COFD denying its purchase order B971 based upon the
factual circumstances before us.

                                        CONCLUSION

       The government's motion is granted with respect to the contract 4911 claim, and
that part of the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The government's motion is
denied with respect to the purchase order B971 claim.

3   Where a CO sends multiple copies of a COFD, the date the contractor receives the later
       copy usually governs when the statute of limitations starts to run because the
       receipt of multiple copies of the COFD may confuse the contractor. TTF, LLC,
       15-1BCA~35,883 at 175,435. That rule does not apply here because MAP never

                OPINION BY ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE PEACOCK

       This timely appeal involves the withdrawal of a purchase order (PO) to acquire
eight air duct assemblies for installation in the fuselage of the KC-13 5 aircraft. Military
Aircraft Parts (MAP or appellant) alleges that, although the due date for delivery of the
supplies had passed, the offer to purchase was revived and thereafter appellant tendered
four of the assemblies that substantially complied with the terms of the purchase order.
Appellant elected to have the appeal processed pursuant to the expedited procedures of
Board Rule 12.2.* A hearing was conducted on 2-3 March 2017 and briefing was
completed on 21 March 2017. For the following reasons, the appeal is denied.

                                 FINDINGS OF FACT

       1. On 15 November 2012, the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation (DLA)
issued Request for Quotations No. SPE4A7-13-T-2198 for eight air duct assemblies,
National Stock Number (NSN) 1660-01-590-7060 (R4, tab 3 at 1-2, 4, 12).

       2. The duct assembly is a component of the air conditioning ductwork for the
KC-135, which provides warm and cool air to the aircraft. The ductwork is located in
the fuselage of the KC-13 5 and is in a '""crowded area"" surrounded by other systems,
such as hydraulic lines, watering bundles, and webbing. If this particular duct assembly

*The Contract Disputes Act, as implemented by the Board's Rules provides that a
      decision under Rule 12.2 shall have no value as precedent, and in the absence of
      fraud, shall be final and conclusive and may not be appealed or set aside.
failed, it would at the very least begin vibrating and break some of the brackets, causing
the ductwork to move. If it came loose, it could begin breaking other brackets and
potentially impact other equipment, such as a hydraulic line. (Tr. 1/183-86)

        3. For these reasons, the duct assembly is designated as a ""CRITICAL
APPLICATION ITEM"" (R4, tab 1at6, tab 3 at 6). FAR 46.203(c) identifies a
""critical application item as one in which the failure of the item could injure personnel
or jeopardize a vital agency mission.""

         4. The duct assembly includes three components at issue in this litigation. The
first component is a lock bolt (Part No. BACB30DX) (R4, tab 34). Three of these lock
bolts are used to fasten a metal assembly onto one end of the part, where it clamps to the
next piece of ductwork (tr. 11196-200). This stiffens the ductwork and allows the
attachment of two rods, which prevents the part from vibrating or moving (tr. 1/197). If
one of the bolts failed, the part would start to come loose and likely cause the other bolts
to fail, causing ""that area to start coming apart"" (tr. 11198). The BACB30DX is an
improvement over its predecessor, Part No. BACB30AL. The BACB30DX
specification requires the use of 8740 alloy steel, per MIL-S-6049 or AMS 6322, while
also allowing for optional materials. (R4, tabs 10, 34 at 5; tr. 11215-19) The
BACB30AL uses different materials (R4, tab 33 at 2; tr. 11215-19). The BACB30DX
also provides a higher level of cadmium plating than the BACB30AL. The cadmium
plating provides ""more protection for corrosions, less likely to corrode, longer life in the
part."" (R4, tabs 33-34, 36; tr. 11219-21, 251)

       5. The second component at issue is a flange, Part No. BACF22N400 (R4,
tab 35). The flange connects the smaller end of the duct assembly to another duct.
The two parts are held together by a clamp. If the flange were to fail, the duct
assembly would come loose from the neighboring duct, creating a loss of rigidity and
leading to vibration. (Tr. 11229-31)

        6. The third component at issue is the NASM20615 rivet (R4, tabs 36-37). The
rivets are used in various areas throughout the duct assembly (R4, tab 41; ex. A-22
at 431-32).

        7. The solicitation described the duct assembly technical data package, which was
available to all potential offerors (R4, tab 3 at 4-12). The technical data package
identified specific exceptions to the drawings. Of particular importance in this case is
Exception 11, which pertained. to the lock bolts and stated ""USE BACB30DX IN LIEU
OF BACB30AL. LOCK BOLT DASH NUMBERS REMAIN UNCHANGED.""
(R4, tab 3 at 4) The technical data package in the solicitation also referenced the Boeing
lock bolt specification for BACB30DX (Revision V, dated 15 June 2007) and the
specification was made available to offerors (R4, tab 3 at 9, tab 35). The technical data
package did not include the BACB30AL specification.


                                            2
       8. The solicitation was a simplified acquisition and incorporated the terms and
conditions set forth in DLA's Master Solicitation for EProcurement Automated
Simplified Acquisitions Revision 8 (November 2012) (R4, tab 3 at 1, tab 40; tr. 1/97-98).
The terms and conditions included several clauses relevant to the instant dispute.

       9. The Master Solicitation included FAR 52.211-5, MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
(AUG 2000) (R4, tab 40 at 6). Section (b) of the Material Requirements clause
required that ""the Contractor shall provide supplies that are new, reconditioned, or
remanufactured, as defined in this clause"" (R4, tab 27). Sections ( d) and (e) stated
that, if the contractor intended to provide ""used, reconditioned, or remanufactured
supplies,"" it must submit ""a detailed description of such supplies"" to the contracting
officer and that such supplies ""may be used in contract performance ifthe Contractor
has proposed the use of such supplies, and the Contracting Officer has authorized their
use"" (R4, tab 27).

        10. The Master Solicitation also included clause DLAD 52.211-9014,
CONTRACTOR RETENTION OF TRACEABILITY DOCUMENTATION (OCT 2008) (R4, tab 40
at 8). The clause stated that, ""whenever the Contractor is not the manufacturer of the
item(s) to be furnished"" under the order:

              (b )( 1) The Contractor shall retain evidence to document
              that items furnished under this contract conform to contract
              requirements. Evidence will generally include information
              tracing the items back to the manufacturing source or its
              authorized distributor. At a minimum, evidence shall be
              sufficient to establish the identity of the item, its
              manufacturing source, and conformance to the item
              description.

(R4, tab 29 at 1) (Emphasis added) The clause further required the contractor to
provide the information ""[a]t the time of Government source inspection"" and required
the contractor to ""retain documentation in accordance with this clause for 5 years after
final payment"" (id. at 2).

         11. The Master Solicitation also included clause DLAD 52.246-9008,
INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE AT ORIGIN (Nov 2011) (R4, tab 40 at 18). Subsection
(e)( 1) states that ""[i]f the Contractor is not the manufacturer of the supplies, evidence
must be furnished to establish that the supplies were produced by the manufacturer""
(R4, tab 31 ).

     12. The Master Solicitation also included the DLAD 52.211.9000,
GOVERNMENT SURPLUS MATERIAL (Nov 2011) clause, (R4, tab 40 at 14). Subsection


                                             3
(f) of the clause noted that ""[o]ffers of commercial surplus, manufacturer's overruns,
[and] residual inventory resulting from terminated Government contracts ... will be
evaluated in accordance with the provision at 52.217-9002"" (R4, tab 28 at 4-5). The
latter clause, was titled CONDITIONS FOR EvALUA TION AND ACCEPTANCE OF OFFERS
FOR PART NUMBERED ITEMS (DEC 2011) (R4, tab 40 at 9). Section (i) of the clause
states:

               The Contracting Officer may at any time, pre-award or
               post-award, request evidence of the technical acceptability
               of the supplies offered in response to this solicitation. At a
               minimum, evidence must be sufficient to establish the
               identity of the product and its manufacturing source.
               The Contracting Officer determines the acceptability and
               sufficiency of documentation or other evidence, at his or
               her sole discretion. If the Contracting Officer requests
               evidence from a Contractor who received an award
               resulting from this solicitation and the Contracting
               Officer subsequently finds the evidence to be
               unacceptable, or if the Contractor fails to provide the
               requested evidence, the award may be cancelled.

(R4, tab 30 at 8) (Emphasis added)

       13. The Master Solicitation further included clause DLAD 52.246-9043,
HIGHER-LEVEL CONTRACT QUALITY REQUIREMENT (NON-MANUFACTURERS)
(Nov 2011), which applied when the FAR 52.246.11, HIGHER-LEVEL CONTRACT
QUALITY REQUIREMENT clause, applied to the solicitation (the Master Solicitation also
included FAR 52.246-11) (R4, tab 40 at 11, 18). This clause also required the contractor
to maintain evidence of the identity of the manufacturer of items provided under the
contract, stating:

               [T]he Contractor represents that it shall ... (b) Maintain and
               provide objective evidence that items furnished under this
               contract were produced at a manufacturing facility
               conforming to the specified higher-level contract quality
               requirement and that the material meets contract
               requirements. At a minimum, evidence shall be
               sufficient to establish the identity of the product and its
               manufacturing source ....

(R4, tab 32)




                                             4
       14. Traceability reduces the risk that the materials used are counterfeit rather
than authentic (tr. 11247, 273, 2/14, 16). Extensive traceability requirements are
standard practice in the commercial aviation industry as well (tr. 2/55, 57, 63, 69).

        15. On 27 November 2012, MAP ""Bid Without Exception"" in response to the
solicitation (R4, tab 4 at 1). Under ""Material Requirements,"" MAP answered ""No""
when asked whether it would provide ""Used, Reconditioned, Remanufactured, or
New/Unused Government Surplus"" (id. at 1). MAP did not obtain authorization from
the contracting officer to use material that was used, reconditioned, remanufactured or
government surplus (tr. 1/109-10, 2/42-43).

        16. On 26 January 2013, DLA awarded MAP unilateral PO No. SPE4A7-13-M-4596
for eight of the air duct assemblies at a unit price of $18, 700 (R4, tab 1 at 14 ). All eight parts
were due on 23 October 2013 (id.). All of the above-noted provisions of the
solicitation were incorporated into the PO (id.).

       17. A MAP engineer was assigned to develop a parts list or ""production
traveler"" identifying, inter alia, the necessary parts needed for manufacturing the air
duct assemblies. The engineer noted on the list, among other things, that the
specifications required use of the BACB30DX lock bolt in lieu of the superseded
BACB30AL bolt. The MAP engineer also noted the need for eight BACF22N400
flanges four of which were in stock. (R4, tab 53 at 4, tab 54 at 7, tab 60; tr. 2/179,
231) The in-stock flanges had been purchased from a surplus dealer, who had
purchased them from a United Kingdom company, who had purchased them at a
bulk sale from FLS Aerospace, an entity in an unidentified location. The latter
firm provided no evidence regarding where it had obtained the flanges. (R4,
tab 15 at 22-28, tab 25)

        18. The Boeing specification for BACF22N400, specified in the solicitation
and order, includes only one authorized source, Aeroquip Corp., CAGE Code 8W928
(R4, tab 1 at 8, tab 35 at 3; tr. 11231, 234). Accordingly, only flanges manufactured
by Aeroquip meet the BACF22N400 specification requirements. The flanges
purchased and installed by MAP did not meet this contract requirement. There is
no identification of who manufactured the in-stock flanges. (R4, tab 15 at 21-28;
tr. 1/234, 239)

        19. On 10 July 2013 appellant's president, Mr. Marin, emailed a parts supplier to
order BACB30AL lock bolts. On 16 July 2013, the parts supplier responded that such
bolts had been superseded by the current Boeing specification which required
BACB30DX bolts. The supplier provided MAP a quote for the BACB30DX bolts. (R4,
tab 62; tr. 2/75)




                                              5
        20. On 17 July 2013, Mr. Marin ordered superseded BACB30AL surplus lock
bolts from another supplier (R4, tab 15 at 36).

        21. In addition to failing to meet the contract requirement to use BACB30DX
bolts, the BACB30AL bolts purchased by MAP from the alternate supplier did not
meet the PO requirements for traceability to the manufacturer and were over 50 years
old and likely would have lost significant corrosion protection since their manufacture
(R4, tab 15 at 32-33, tab 33 at 2; tr. 1/210-11, 2/5-7, 45).

        22. Although the manufacturer of the rivets used in the assemblies was
documented by MAP, the documentation from MAP's parts supplier indicated that
the rivets were used/repaired/overhauled surplus and not new parts (R4, tab 15 at 2, 8,
12-19; tr. 2/41-42).

       23. On 17 September 2013, MAP also purchased four surplus BACF22N400
flanges for the assemblies that could not be traced back to the manufacturer (R4,
tab 64 at 14; tr. 11244-45).

       24. MAP failed to deliver any of the air duct assemblies by the contractually
scheduled date of 23 October 2013. In late October a series of conversations occurred
between MAP and the government regarding the status of the items. On 6 November
2013, Mr. Marin informed the government that four assemblies were ready for
inspection at MAP facilities. Previously, on 29 October 2013, Mr. Marin had notified
the government that the remaining four assemblies were awaiting parts and could not
ship until 23 February 2014. (R4, tabs 10-13; tr. 1/113-14)

       25. On 7 and 12 November 2013, the government inspected the four tendered
assemblies. It discovered the aforementioned deficiencies with the installed bolts,
flanges, and rivets which were extensively analyzed and discussed with MAP over
approximately the next two weeks. (R4, tab 15 at 2-36, tab 16 at 1-2, tab 24 at 2;
exs. A-9, A-10 at 343, ex. A-46 at 626-839; tr. 2/21-23, 26, 44-45, 118-121, 133-35,
148-50) During this period, MAP performed very little work on the PO (R4, tab 24
at 7-39).

        26. On 26 November 2013, the government orally notified appellant informally
that the government was in the process of cancelling the PO and a modification to that
effect was in process (R4, tab 20; tr. 11127-28).

      27. On 6 December 2013, the contracting officer issued Modification
No. POOOO 1 cancelling the PO (R4, tab 2).

      28. On 28 September 2016, appellant filed a certified claim asserting damages
of $134,553, including anticipatory profit, alleging that the PO was improperly


                                           6
cancelled and the government breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing in doing
so. MAP further asserted that the duct assemblies were substantially complete at the
time of the PO's cancellation. (R4, tab 24)

       29. The claim was denied by a contracting officer's final decision dated
23 November 2016 (R4, tab 25), from which this timely appeal was filed by letter
dated 28 November 2016.

                                       DECISION

      Appellant contends that the government improperly cancelled the PO and ·in so
doing breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing. In particular, it alleges that the
government failed to evaluate MAP's offer to cure the alleged defects. MAP asserts it
was entitled to a reasonable time beyond the contract delivery date to correct what it
considered were ""minor"" defects in its supplies.

       Although all of appellant's arguments have not been expressly addressed in this
decision, they have been considered in reaching the conclusions herein. None of
MAP's contentions provides a basis to sustain the appeal. Moreover, inasmuch as the
appeal is denied because appellant has failed to establish that it is entitled to recover,
issues regarding quantum are not reached.

       ""A unilateral purchase order is an offer by the Government which a contractor
can accept by delivering the requested supplies in accordance with the terms and
conditions specified in the order."" Alsace Industrial, Inc., ASBCA No. 51709, 99-1
BCA ii 30,227 at 149,542. Moreover, complete performance, rather than substantial
performance, is required. ""If complete performance in accordance with the terms and
conditions is not tendered, the Government's offer lapses by its own terms, rendering
the purchase order incapable of being accepted by a contractor."" Id. An offeree's
absence of performance or defective performance operates as non-occurrence of the
""condition."" RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS§§ 37 cmt. b, 224 cmt. c;
3 ERIC M. HOLMES, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 11.1 n.14 (rev. 1996). Generally, when
the parties have made an event a ""condition"" of their agreement, there is no
mitigating standard of materiality or substantiality which is applicable to
non-occurrence of that event. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 23 7 cmt. d.;
Comptech Corp., ASBCA No. 55526, 08-2 BCA ii 33,982 at 168,083 (emphasis
added).· Once the offer has lapsed, the government is not liable to the contractor for
any costs it incurred in attempting to perform in full. ""When an offer lapses by its
terms, the offeree (supplier) bears the costs of nonperformance."" TTF, L.L.C.,
ASBCA Nos. 58495, 58516, 13 BCA ii 35,403 at 173,696. Thus, ifthe supplies
delivered by the contractor pursuant to a unilateral PO do not comply with the PO
requirements, the contractor has failed to perform and the contract lapses.



                                            7
       ""[I]t is well established that the government has the right to insist on 'strict
compliance' with its specifications."" Comptech, 08-2 BCA if 33,982 at 168,085; see
also Cascade Pacific Int'! v. United States, 773 F.2d 287, 291 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (""The
government, just as any other party, is entitled to receive that for which it contracted
and has the right to accept only goods that conform to the specification.""). The
government here contracted for the delivery of eight duct assemblies. The government
also expressly required duct assemblies held together with a specific type of lock bolt,
the BACB30DX, not the superseded BACB30AL lock bolt. The PO required parts
with traceability to the manufacturer and manufactured using new material rather than
""used, reconditioned, remanufactured, or new/unused government surplus"" material.
MAP never obtained authorization from the contracting officer to use other than new
material. The government was entitled to receive duct assemblies which complied
with all of these requirements. If the duct assemblies delivered by MAP failed to meet
any of these requirements the government properly could reject them.

       Here, appellant failed to deliver the specified supplies by the due date.
Ultimately, MAP later tendered only four of the eight duct assemblies required by the
PO. Moreover, the four duct assemblies that were submitted for inspection by MAP
were defective in multiple respects. The duct assemblies included the superseded
BACB30AL lock bolts. In addition, the duct assemblies incorporated commercial
surplus lock bolts and flanges without sufficient traceability to the manufacturers of
the components. Finally, MAP agreed to provide new material rather than ""used,
reconditioned, remanufactured, or new/unused Government surplus"" material, MAP
submitted lock bolts that were over 50 years old and rivets that were certified as
""surplus parts, used, repaired, or reconditioned"" rather than ""new.""

        Appellant's contentions, in particular those alleging government bad faith, must
be evaluated in the context of these multiple failures to comply with contractual
requirements. MAP, inter alia, contends that the failures were relatively ""minor"" and
either should have been waived or MAP should have been provided an opportunity to
make corrections, including replacing the bolts. Appellant asserts that the
government's failures to waive late delivery and allegedly ""minor"" non-compliances
of the four tendered assemblies and permit purportedly ""minor"" corrections, evidence
government bad faith and failure to fulfill its contractual duty of good faith and fair
dealing. MAP's prior experiences with government leniency and issues related to
conditional approval of first articles under prior contracts are inapt. The PO required
fully compliant production quantities. The air duct assemblies were not first articles.
Moreover, the merits of multifarious and unique circumstances of prior contract
provisions/requirements and disputes with various government personnel and
procuring entities involving primarily the adequacy of first articles, wholly fail to
support its allegations of bad faith in the administration of the instant PO. Here, the
government simply and properly enforced its rights under the solicitation. ""The
implied duty of good faith and fair dealing cannot expand a party's contractual duties


                                           8
beyond those in the express contract or create duties inconsistent with the contract's
provisions."" Precision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States, 596 F .3d 817, 831 (Fed.
Cir. 2010); see also Century Exploration New Orleans, LLC v. United States, 
745 F.3d1168, 1179 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (""Appellants cannot rely on the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing to change the text of their contractual obligations.""); 13 SAMUEL
WILLISTON & RICHARD A. LORD, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 63 :22
(4th ed. 2000) (""As a general principle, there can be no breach of the implied promise
or covenant of good faith and fair dealing where the contract expressly permits the
actions being challenged, and the defendant acts in accordance with the express terms
of the contract."").

       With regard to the lock bolts, the specification prohibition of BACB30AL lock
bolts was not ambiguous. MAP's own employees and supplier recognized and
informed Mr. Marin of the prohibition. Appellant's rather circuitous contentions
regarding its asserted right to use an ""equal,"" misinterpret the solicitation and are
irrelevant in any event because appellant did not use an ""equal."" Instead, it provided
the superseded BACB30AL bolt. The BACB30DX not only superseded the
BACB30AL bolt but it represented a significant ""improvement"" that the government
was entitled to receive.

        The lock bolts and flanges also did not satisfy the extensive solicitation
requirements regarding traceability of the component parts to the manufacturer. The
traceability provisions were not merely ""paperwork"" exercises but were designed to
insure in part that counterfeit items were not being provided. Overseas-sourced
components, used by MAP in the air duct assemblies, were reasonably a particular
concern. Further, as recognized in DCX-CHOL Enterprises, Inc., ASBCA No. 54707,
08-2 BCA ~ 33,889 at 167,728, traceability requirements are included in procurements
for critical application items, like the duct assemblies to be installed in the fuselage of
FC-135 military aircraft here, because ""Critical application items frequently must
carry with them the assurance of superior quality and reliability."" As the Board noted
in DCX, inserting traceability requirements into the order ensured that ""respondent
paid a premium price for connectors that had been subjected to a rigorous testing .
regimen and had been found to be 'the highest grade.""' Id. It was MAP's duty to
retain sufficient traceability documentation and, to the extent any other evidence of
traceability ever existed, MAP has failed to fulfill its duty.

        MAP asserts tpat none of the four traceability clauses in the solicitation/order
applies because they apply only to the end item - the ducts themselves - and not their
components. Thus, MAP maintains, as long as it manufactured, i.e., assembled, the
ducts, it does not need to prove that the components it used are traceable to the
designated manufacturers. However, MAP's interpretation runs afoul of the language
in the contract, its own contemporaneous interpretation, established ASBCA law, and
the primary purpose of the traceability requirements generally.


                                             9
      Title 41 of the United States Code defines ""items"" and ""supplies"" for purposes
of Federal procurement. 41 U.S.C. § 1081 states that:

              [T]he terms ""item"" and ""item of supply"" -

                     ( 1) mean an individual part, component,
              subassembly, assembly, or subsystem integral to a major
              system, and other property which may be replaced during
              the service life of the system, including spare parts and
              replenishment spare parts; but
                     (2) do not include packaging or labeling associated
              with shipment or identification of an item.

41 U.S.C. § 115 states that ""the term 'supplies' has the same meaning as the terms
'item' and 'item of supply.""'

        Thus, Congress has made clear that ""items"" and ""supplies"" include individual
parts, components, subassemblies, assemblies, and subsystems of a major system, as
well as any other property that may be replaced in a system. Only the packaging and
labeling associated with an item are excluded. In addition, 41 U.S.C. § 105 explains
that ""the term 'component' means an item supplied to the Federal Government as part
of an end item or of another component."" Thus, Congress specifically differentiated
between an ""item"" and an ""end item,"" meaning that (1) the definition of item is
broader than just the particular end item purchased (in this case, the duct assemblies)
and (2) items are ""part of an end item."" The components here (the bolts, flanges, and
rivets) were part of the end item duct assembly. In short, the United States Code
defines ""items"" and ""supplies"" as anything and everything the contractor provides to
the government pursuant to a procurement, other than packaging or labeling. In DCX,
08-2 BCA ii 33,889, the Board concluded that traceability requirements extend to
components of end items. Id. at 167,723. Additionally, during contract performance
MAP consistently collected and maintained traceability information for most
components contrary to its present contentions. Moreover, MAP's interpretation
would render the traceability requirements largely meaningless and ineffective. Their
primary purpose is to ensure that authentic material is installed on the aircraft. Under
MAP's interpretation, the government would only be able to ensure it is receiving
authentic components (e.g. fasteners and flanges) when it is purchasing that particular
end item. The government would not be able to ensure manufacturing provenance and
genuineness purchasing those same components when they are included in a
higher-level part or assembly.

      MAP also quoted that it would submit new material and that it would not
provide material which was ""Used, Reconditioned, Remanufactured, or New/Unused


                                           10
Government Surplus."" MAP, however, did not exclusively provide new material in its
duct assemblies. The surplus rivets were used, repaired, or reconditioned surplus
parts. MAP has not introduced evidence regarding the condition of the rivets at the
time it received them. These parts have not been established as ""new.""

        Further, in addition to the noncompliance of the BACB30AL lock bolts with
the solicitation specification and traceability requirements, the BACB30AL
specification was discontinued for procurement on 1 May 1963. If the MAP bolts
were authentic, they likely were at least 50 years old when MAP purchased them in
July 2013. MAP did not introduce evidence regarding the condition of the bolts at the
time it received them.

       Finally, the record fails to establish that the deficiencies were ""minor"" or easily
and expeditiously correctable. In this regard, appellant erroneously alleges that the
government had extensive duties regarding the testing or analysis of the
nonconforming components and further duties to assist MAP in establishing the ease
of correcting deficiencies and traceability of the parts and the provenance of their
manufacture. To the contrary, appellant bore the burden of proving compliance and
traceability. If the known defects and traceability issues were as ""minor"" as alleged,
appellant should have made corrections and sufficiently documented the provenance of
the parts forthwith.

       Even assuming arguendo that MAP's noncompliance were ""minor"" as it alleges,
the delivery date for the four tendered items had passed. Therefore, corrections could
not have been timely accomplished ""within the required delivery schedule."" See
FAR 46.407(b ). Whether the government revived the PO when it allowed MAP to
tender four parts for inspection rather than withdrawing the PO is irrelevant. A revived
PO has the same terms as the original PO. MAP delivered only four of the eight duct
assemblies and the four assemblies tendered by MAP were deficient as detailed above.
Cf Amplitronics, Inc., ASBCA No. 33732, 87-2 BCA i-1 19,906.

       For the aforementioned reasons the government properly cancelled the PO and
appellant has failed to establish that the cancellation was done in bad faith. The appeal
is denied.

               OPINION BY ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE O'SULLIVAN
                 ON THE GOVERNMENT'S MOTION TO DISMISS

      The government has filed a motion to dismiss this Board Rule 12.3 appeal
without prejudice as premature under Board Rule 18. Appellant opposes. For the
reasons stated below, we deny the motion.

           STATEMENT OF FACTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE MOTION

        On 17 March 2009, the government issued Order No. SPM4A7-09-M-6653
(Order 6653) to appellant Military Aircraft Parts (MAP) for aircraft fairings for the
C-130 aircraft (R4, tab A 1 at 1). This order was accepted and signed by MAP on
18 March 2009, and contains the clause at FAR 52.249-1, TERMINATION FOR
CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT (SHORT FORM)(APR 1984) (id. at 1, 16). The
order required MAP to manufacture two units for First Article Test (FAT), with
thirteen production units to be delivered after first article approval (id. at 9-11, 15).
The total price of Order 6653 was $22,015.00 (id. at 1).

      On 10 December 2009, the government issued Order No. SPM4A7-10-M-3828
(Order 3828) to MAP for additional C-130 aircraft fairings. This order required one
FAT unit and seven production units. (R4, tab B 1 at 8-9) The total price of Order
3828 was $16,450 (id. at 1). Order 3828 was followed on 21 January 2011 by Order
No. SPM4A7-l l-M-G805 (Order G805) for an additional two production units and
one FAT unit (R4, tab Cl at 9-10). The total price of Order G805 was $3,680.00 (id.
at 1).

       MAP shipped two FAT units on 17 May 2012, with an expected delivery date
of 24 May 2012, for testing under Order 6653 (R4, tab AS). The government
completed its testing on or about 14 November 2012. The test results indicated that
the part met the tests for heat treatment, conversion coating, chemical composition,
and organic finish requirement. (R4, tab A6 at 4) For the form, fit and function test,
one dimensional measurement was noted to be out of tolerance, but the mechanical
engineer who performed the measurement commented that the difference was
""Possible Trim"" (id. at 9). In addition, the visual layover test resulted in a discrepancy
noted as ""curvature mid-way right side too much"" (id. at 8). With respect to this, the
conclusion by the engineer who signed the test report was:

              The first article's loft surface contour was compared to
              mylar number 337510 and 337530. The contour of the
              first article matched the contour data on both mylars.
              Project engineer should confirm these findings to
              determine impact on mission requirements.

(Id. at 9)

        The same day, 14 November 2012, an email from BG Scott Jansson of DLA
Aviation to Mr. Marin of MAP noted that the part had passed laboratory testing but



                                                                                             I
""has failed the FIT check. We are awaiting the Lead Engineer's review to either pass
or fail the FIT."" (R4, tab A7 at 2)

        The record does not contain any information about the specifics of that review.
On 19 November 2012 a Notification of FAT results under Order No. 6653 was
issued. The first article was disapproved, with a recommendation from engineering
that the vendor be allowed to correct the discrepancies and resubmit the first article
within 90 days of notification of the results. (R4, tab A9 at 1) With respect to the two
noted discrepancies, this document stated:

              Even though the part fit the mylars, during the form fit test,
              the part failed to align correctly in the center curvature at
              the WS83 end. The mylar only checks the open ends, not
              alignment or position. The deviation on dimension #3 can
              be attributed to trim.                                                         !
(Id.) On 7 December 2012, a letter from the contracting officer (CO), Alicia Wolford,
was sent to MAP. In that letter, Ms. Wolford stated that MAP's first article was


                                            2
                                                                                             I
disapproved and ""this contract could be terminated for default."" (R4, tab AlO at 2)
She further informed MAP that a bilateral modification would be forwarded cancelling
the contract in its entirety at no cost to either party (id.). There is no explanation in the
record of why the CO decided not to follow the engineering recommendation that
MAP be allowed to correct the two discrepancies and resubmit its first article.

      On 12 December 2012, MAP forwarded CO Wolford's letter to Randall Fritz, a
Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) quality assurance specialist, stating:

              We recently had our FA fail in the attached letter. I
              believe this part is used as part of the fairing for the C-130
              and the aircraft may be at Mc[C]lellan/US Coast Guard
              base.

              In the past they have allowed us to inspect their plane and
              perhaps we could do this again.

              We don't know why the part failed, as it matches a sample
              part we have very well. We also hold two other contracts
              for this part and I don't know how DOD will ever obtain
              more parts if the data to build it is incorrect, as their letter
              implies.

              Would you consider working with us to get onto the base if
              we can confirm this part is used for aircraft they have? We
              would like to put our part up against the aircraft for
              comparison.

(R4, tab A15 at 24) On the same day, Mr. Fritz forwarded the request on to
Lisa Hardy, the DLA contract specialist, stating in part:

              Please see Rob's request below:
              I am not sure DCMA (QAR's) will be assisting MAP with
              this request. These contracts are late, and made wrong per
              the letter. I like how he is concerned with ""how EVER
              will DoD obtain these parts again.""

(Id. at 27) Ms. Hardy responded on 31 December 2012:

              Randy, the modification to cancel this one has been
              executed and I am working on cancelling the other two
              contracts/orders as quickly as I can due to non-shipment
              and FAT failure of the -6653 contract. Thank you.


                                             3
(Id.) Meanwhile, MAP had written to Ms. Hardy on 21 December 2012 noting that the
""FA rejection for this NSN is vague, seems to suggest our part was made properly to
the mylar and our part appears to be made correctly to the data and a sample part we
obtained."" MAP further advised that it was working to obtain access to the C-130 at
McClellan to check the part, and that it had spent $18,671 on the item to date and
wanted to determine the source of failure. MAP requested 30 days to evaluate the
recent first article disapproval. (Id. at 30)

         Unilateral Modification No. P00002 cancelling Order 6653 was signed by
CO Wolford on 8 December 2012 (R4, tab A3). Unilateral Modification No. POOOOl
cancelling Order 3828 was signed by CO Janice Hicks on 6 May 2013, although a
letter from CO Wolford expressing the government's intent to cancel was sent to MAP
on 17 December 2012 (R4, tabs B2, B 10). Order G805 was cancelled at no cost to
either party by bilateral modification dated 13 June 2013, although a letter notifying
MAP that the modification would be forwarded for signature was sent to MAP on
17 December 2012 (R4, tabs C2, C5). On 29 May 2013, CO Hicks acknowledged that
the cancellation of Order 6653 was processed without Mr. Marin's signature, but
stated: ""At this time, we will leave it the way it was signed unless the Contractor
questions the validity of the modification"" (R4, tab Al4). At this time, MAP was still
seeking assistance in accessing the C-130 aircraft at the Coast Guard facility to
determine the cause of first article failure (id.). Subsequently, MAP's request for
assistance in accessing the aircraft was denied by DCMA on the grounds that MAP's
contracts had all been cancelled and DCMA could not validate the need for a fit check
due to the lack of active contracts for the part (R4, tab A15 at 44-45).

        On 27 May 2015, MAP submitted a claim to DLA for breach of contract, citing
all three orders and raising, among other issues, defective specifications, insufficient
justification for first article disapproval, failure to provide an opportunity to correct
minor defects, and government acts inconsistent with the purpose of the contract,
including a failure to cooperate to resolve first article issues. The sum claimed
pursuant to Order 6653 was $17 ,924.52, consisting of direct material and labor costs,
profit of$1,215.66, and $500.00 for consideration provided for a modification
extending delivery dates. An additional $708.75 on Order 3828 and $268.50 on Order
G805 was claimed for anticipatory profit, for a total claim of $18,901. 77. (R4,
tab Al5 at 1-4)

       CO Hicks issued a final decision on MAP's claim on 21July2015
(R4, tab Al6). In that decision, she acknowledged that CO Wolford had improperly
executed a unilateral (vs. bilateral) cancellation of Order 6653 before providing MAP
with notification of the first article failure (id. at 4). She ascribed this action to an
incorrect belief on the part of CO Wolford that MAP had requested a no-cost



                                            4
cancellation of Order 6653, and stated that, accordingly, the cancellation would be
converted to a termination for the convenience of the government (id. at 4-5).
CO Hicks denied any relief with respect to Orders 3828 or G805 (id. at 5). The
modification converting the cancellation of Order 6653 to a termination for the
convenience of the government was subsequently issued on 16 October 2015 (R4,
tab A4). The government's motion to dismiss this appeal followed on
2 November 2015.

                                      DISCUSSION

        The government asserts that this appeal is premature because MAP has not
submitted a termination settlement proposal pursuant to the procedures set forth in
FAR Part 49. According to the government, unless MAP submits a proposal, and until
the parties' negotiations on that proposal reach impasse and the CO issues a unilateral
determination, MAP may not file an appeal at the Board, and the Board is without
jurisdiction to hear those portions of MAP's appeal involving amounts compensable
under the termination for convenience clause. (Gov't mot. at 2)

       MAP counters, inter alia, that (1) the CO's final decision is an attempt to use an
untimely termination for convenience to avoid airing of the facts supporting a breach
of contract on the part of the government; and (2) granting the government's motion
would deprive MAP of the benefits of the Board's accelerated Rule 12 process and
unduly delay the resolution of its claim to its prejudice (app. reply at 1-5).

        In James M Ellett Constr. Co. v. United States, 93 F.3d 1537 (Fed. Cir. 1996),
the court decided that a contractor is not precluded by a pending termination
settlement proposal from pursuing contract claims independent of that proposal. In
Ellett, the Forest Service terminated for convenience, two months after award, a
contract for the construction of a logging road. Shortly thereafter, the contractor
submitted a claim for $545,157.19, followed by a termination settlement proposal.*

        On appeal from the trial court's dismissal ofEllett's suit for lack of jurisdiction,
the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected the government's
argument that once it terminated the contract for convenience, Ellett's earlier claim
submission could not be pursued independently. The court agreed with the contractor
that the government does not have the authority ""for simply eliminating valid
contractor claims by terminating the contract."" 93 F.3d at 1546. The court duly noted
that the Contract Disputes Act provides for interest to run on contractor claims, while
under the regulations, no interest is allowed on termination settlement proposals. 
Id. at1547. It stated further:                                                                       f
                                                                                               f
*Ellett subsequently filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims
                                                                                               I
                                             5
                     It does not stand to reason that the government can
              avoid a statutory right to interest on a claim by simply
              terminating the contract for convenience. We do not
              suggest that contracting officers would intentionally do so;
              we presume they perform their duties in good faith, and in
              accordance with the law and governing regulations.
              Nevertheless, we cannot endorse a scheme that would
              circumvent Congress's stated desire to grant contractors
              interest on valid, properly certified claims. [Citation
              omitted]

Id. Thus, Ellett was entitled to pursue its separate claim for increased costs, which was
either constructively denied by the CO or deemed denied since the CO did not address
the merits. ""Either way, the trial court had jurisdiction."" Id. at 1548.

       In Agility Defense & Government Services, Inc., ASBCA Nos. 58870, 59261,
15-1BCAii35,810, we followed Ellett in rejecting an argument by DLA that the
Board lacked jurisdiction over a pre-termination claim once the contract was
terminated for convenience and appellant failed to submit a termination proposal. We
disagreed with the government's argument that the relief available under the
pre-termination claim would be the same as that available under the later termination,
noting for instance that the timing of the termination could have a significant impact
on the measure of recovery. In addition, we disagreed that the pre-termination claim
was merged into the subsequent termination for convenience:

              Independent claims are not necessarily merged into the
              termination of the same contract under which the claim arose
              and may be appealed separately from the termination for
              convenience appeal.

15-1BCAii35,810 at 175,133 (citing James M Ellett, 93 F.3d at 1548; RW
Electronics Corp., ASBCA No. 46592, 96-2 BCA ii 28,540).

        In this case, DLA converted its contract cancellation into a termination for
convenience, so there may be no difference in the timing of the operative event.
However, MAP's claim is not for constructive termination, but for breach. Therefore,
the measure of damages may be significantly different from that available under a
termination for convenience, even a retroactive one. Moreover, as the Federal Circuit
held in Ellett, the CDA grants contractors a right to interest on their claims, whereas
interest does not run on a termination settlement proposal. Therefore, we find that
MAP's breach claim is an independent claim that is not merged into the government's
subsequent termination for convenience. We have jurisdiction.

                                   CONCLUSION

       For the foregoing reasons, the government's motion to dismiss is denied.

                 SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT

 LAURIE WOODS,                            B307220

        Plaintiff and Appellant,          (Los Angeles County
                                          Super. Ct. No. BC697649)
        v.

 AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE,

        Defendant and Respondent.




      APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of Los
Angeles County. Daniel J. Buckley, Judge. Affirmed.
      Setareh Law Group, Shaun Setareh and Thomas Segal for
Plaintiff and Appellant.
      Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, Gary M. McLaughlin,
Aileen M. McGrath, Jonathan P. Slowik and Victor A. Salcedo for
Defendant and Respondent.
               _________________________________
       Laurie Woods appeals from an order denying certification
of a class of persons who worked without pay for respondent
American Film Institute (AFI). Since 1987, AFI has presented an
annual film festival in Los Angeles (the Festival) for which it
uses volunteer workers. Woods contends that those volunteers
were actually employees because AFI is not permitted to use
unpaid labor under California law. Woods filed a putative class
action alleging that such workers were therefore denied benefits
that California employers are required to provide to employees,
such as minimum and overtime wages, meal and rest breaks, and
wage statements.
       The trial court denied class certification on the ground that
common issues would not predominate over individual ones. The
court reasoned that a worker cannot be classified as an employee
unless the worker expects some compensation. Determining
whether any particular class members expected compensation
would therefore require separate, individual mini-trials. The
court also found that whether AFI had an unlawful meal and rest
break policy that it uniformly applied to its workers could not be
determined through common proof.
       We affirm based upon the trial court’s first reason for
denying certification. The trial court correctly decided that
putative class members who expected no compensation were not
employees under California law. The class that Woods moved to
certify is broad enough to include persons who expected to be
paid. Thus, if the case were to proceed as a class action, the trier
of fact would need to decide whether each class member expected
to be paid or was in fact a volunteer. The trial court acted within
its discretion in finding that the need to decide such individual
issues would preclude common issues from predominating.




                                 2
                          BACKGROUND
1.     Woods’ Allegations
       Woods’s operative First Amended Complaint (Complaint)
alleges that AFI has solicited thousands of volunteers to work at
its Festival “under the false pretense that volunteers will get to
enjoy the event in exchange for their services.” In reality, the
volunteers are required to work and do not have an opportunity
to attend the event. Thus, the volunteers “do not receive any
compensation for their ‘employment’ and in many cases incur
expenses for which they have not been reimbursed by [AFI].”
       The Complaint alleges that the volunteers’ hours are
controlled by a volunteer manager, and that the volunteers are
typically asked to arrive earlier and stay later than their
assigned shift. AFI imposes requirements such as a mandatory
orientation and a minimum number of shifts that volunteers
must work. The Complaint alleges that “[b]ecause volunteers
were expected to, and in fact did, spend the vast majority of their
time performing job duties under [AFI’s] direction, supervision
and control, the promise of free admission was illusory.”
       Woods claims that she worked as a volunteer at the
Festival for four days in November 2017. She alleges that she
worked between 12 and 14 hours each of those days. She claims
that members of the putative class regularly worked more than
eight hours per day and more than 40 hours per week.
       The Complaint asserts claims for unpaid wages, unpaid
overtime, missed meal and rest periods, failure to reimburse
expenses, and failure to provide wage statements.
2.     Woods’s Class Certification Motion
       Woods filed a motion seeking certification of a class
consisting of “[a]ll persons who worked at the AFI Festival from




                                 3
March 20, 2014 through the date of class certification who were
not paid for their work.” In support of the motion, Woods
submitted declarations from a number of volunteer workers and
provided evidence concerning AFI’s agreements with Festival
sponsors.
      The volunteers described their hours of work and their job
responsibilities. The volunteers’ jobs included tasks such as
ushering guests, handing out tickets and ticket forms, answering
phones, controlling lines for events, working in the box office, and
running errands. Several of the declarants testified that they
worked longer than eight hours per day on occasion. None of the
volunteers were paid, and none testified that they expected
payment.
      Evidence concerning the Festival sponsors showed that AFI
received tens of thousands of dollars each from movie studios and
film producers as well as sponsorship contributions from
companies such as Coca-Cola, American Airlines, Dolby, and
others. In return, AFI agreed to show the producers’ films,
coordinate events surrounding the screenings and after parties,
and provide transportation using vehicles from the event’s
automotive sponsor. AFI also agreed to acknowledge the
corporate donors as sponsors and to recognize their sponsorship
in various ways at the events.
      Woods’s motion claimed that AFI is not a charitable
organization that is permitted to use volunteers under California
law. Rather, Woods asserted that AFI’s Festival simply “operates
as a marketing operation for the film industry.” Woods argued
that the question whether AFI could lawfully use volunteers for
the Festival was itself an “overarching common issue that will
determine the claims of the class.”




                                 4
      In opposition, AFI argued that common questions would
not predominate over individual issues for the claims that Woods
sought to certify. AFI argued that Woods was wrong in claiming
that AFI is precluded from using volunteer labor. AFI provided
evidence that it is a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization dedicated
to the film industry. AFI claimed that, as such, it is permitted to
use volunteers under California law, and that individual
members of the class would therefore have a claim only if they
expected to be paid as employees. AFI argued that proving such
an expectation by particular class members would require
individual proof. AFI also argued that Woods failed to show that
AFI uniformly applied an unlawful break policy to class members
and failed to provide any common means to determine which
class members worked more than eight-hour days for purposes of
Woods’s overtime claim. Finally, AFI claimed that Woods was
not a proper class representative.
3.    The Trial Court’s Ruling
      The trial court denied certification on the ground that “any
common questions present here are inundated and overwhelmed
by the litany of unmanageable individualized inquiries that
would be necessary to establish AFI’s liability to any putative
class member.” The trial court rejected Woods’s argument that
AFI was not permitted to use volunteers under California law.
The court reasoned that “both employment and independent
contractor relationships always contemplate an expectation of
monetary compensation in exchange for services rendered.” In
particular, the definitions in the wage order that governs working
conditions in the motion picture industry “overwhelmingly
support an interpretation of ‘work’ that interposes a threshold
requirement that the ‘employee’ . . . expects at least some level of




                                 5
monetary compensation.” The court concluded that, under
Woods’s interpretation of the law, “volunteerism in California
would grind to a halt overnight.”
       The trial court concluded that, because workers are not
employees unless they expect compensation for their services,
determining whether particular class members were actually
employees would create individual issues that would dominate
the trial. “[E]ach individual class member would be required to
testify that they did, or did not, expect payment in return for
their services provided during the AFI film festival. This would
splinter any potential class action into hundreds of individual
trials.”
       The trial court also found that Woods had failed to provide
evidence of an unlawful meal and rest period policy that AFI
uniformly applied to the class. The court explained that Woods
alleged only that AFI had no written meal and rest period policy.
However, the evidence showed that AFI had an “unwritten policy
encouraging and authorizing volunteers to take as many meal
and rest breaks for however long they wanted . . . . Thus,
individualized inquiries permeate and overwhelm Plaintiff’s meal
and rest period claims.” The court also found that individual
proof concerning the hours that each class member worked would
be unmanageable.
       In light of these findings, the trial court did not reach AFI’s
argument that Woods was not a proper class representative.
                            DISCUSSION
1.     Standard for Class Certification and Standard
       of Review
       A lawsuit may proceed as a class action “when the question
is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when




                                  6
the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them
all before the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 382.) To certify a class,
“[t]he party advocating class treatment must demonstrate the
existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous class, a
well-defined community of interest, and substantial benefits from
certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the
alternatives.” (Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012)
53 Cal.4th 1004, 1021 (Brinker).) The community of interest
factor in turn has three requirements: (1) common questions of
fact or law that predominate over individual issues; “ ‘ “(2) class
representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class; and
(3) class representatives who can adequately represent the
class.” ’ ” (Ibid.)
       Where, as here, the class certification requirement at issue
is predominance, the trial court must determine whether “ ‘the
issues which may be jointly tried, when compared with those
requiring separate adjudication, are so numerous or substantial
that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to
the judicial process and to the litigants.’ ” (Brinker, supra, 
53Cal.4th at p. 1021, quoting Collins v. Rocha (1972) 
7 Cal.3d 232,238.) To answer this question, a court must “examine the
allegations of the complaint and supporting declarations
[citation] and consider whether the legal and factual issues they
present are such that their resolution in a single class proceeding
would be both desirable and feasible.” (Brinker, at pp. 1021–
1022.)
       In addition to deciding whether common issues
predominate, a court considering class certification must
determine whether the remaining individual issues can be
resolved “fairly and efficiently.” (Duran v. U.S. Bank National




                                 7
Assn. (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1, 28–29.) “In considering whether a
class action is a superior device for resolving a controversy, the
manageability of individual issues is just as important as the
existence of common questions uniting the proposed class.” (Id.
at p. 29.)
       Our review of the trial court’s class certification ruling is
“narrowly circumscribed.” (Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1022.)
We review the trial court’s ruling only for abuse of discretion.
“ ‘A certification order generally will not be disturbed unless (1) it
is unsupported by substantial evidence, (2) it rests on improper
criteria, or (3) it rests on erroneous legal assumptions.’ ” (Id. at
p. 1022, quoting Fireside Bank v. Superior Court (2007) 
40Cal.4th 1069, 1089 (Fireside).)
2.     The Trial Court Acted Within Its Discretion in
       Denying Certification of the Proposed Class
       a.     The trial court properly considered legal
              issues necessary to decide whether class
              certification was appropriate
       Class certification is a procedural issue separate from the
merits of the plaintiff’s case. Thus, “resolution of disputes over
the merits of a case generally must be postponed until after class
certification has been decided [citation], with the court assuming
for purposes of the certification motion that any claims have
merit.” (Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1023.) However, “[w]hen
evidence or legal issues germane to the certification question bear
as well on aspects of the merits, a court may properly evaluate
them.” (Id. at pp. 1023–1024, italics added.) Indeed, “[t]o the
extent the propriety of certification depends upon disputed
threshold legal or factual questions, a court may, and indeed
must, resolve them.” (Id. at p. 1025.) If resolution of an issue




                                  8
concerning the merits is necessary to decide class certification,
the court’s review should be limited to “ ‘those aspects of the
merits that affect the decisions essential’ to class certification.”
(Id. at p. 1024, quoting Schleicher v. Wendt (7th Cir. 2010) 
618F.3d 679, 685.)
       Here, the dispositive legal issue is whether AFI could
lawfully use volunteer workers for its Festival. The issue in
dispute is even narrower. Woods does not dispute that workers
may volunteer for some types of nonprofit organizations without
becoming employees under California law. The parties also agree
that a person who works for such a qualifying nonprofit might
actually be an employee if that person expects to be paid. Thus,
the parties disagree only on the question of whether AFI falls
within the category of nonprofit organizations that may lawfully
use volunteer labor.
       Consideration of that issue was essential for deciding class
certification. Only by determining the applicable legal standard
could the trial court decide whether the issue of liability was
amenable to resolution through common proof.
       As mentioned, Woods sought to certify a class consisting of
“[a]ll persons” who worked at the Festival “who were not paid for
their work.” If Woods is correct that AFI may not use volunteer
labor under California law, then the question whether class
members were employees could be answered on a common basis
because each class member was entitled to compensation whether
or not they expected to be paid.
       However, the converse is not true. If AFI is correct that it
may properly use voluntary labor, it would not be liable to class
members who expected no compensation. But the class is defined
more broadly than such persons. The proposed class of persons




                                 9
“who were not paid for their work” includes persons who did not
expect to be paid as well as any class members who expected
payment but did not receive it. The persons who expected
payment might be entitled to compensation as employees. The
trial court reasonably concluded that whether particular class
members expected payment would need to be resolved through
individual proof that would predominate over common issues.
       Woods claims that this is a manufactured issue. She
explains that she “made clear that she did not intend to argue
that either she, or anyone else who worked at the AFI [Festival]
expected to be paid.” She argues that the legal issue of whether
AFI could use volunteers was therefore itself a common issue
that the trial court should have deferred to the merits stage of
the litigation. Woods’s theory is apparently that, if she did not
claim that any class members expected payment, the trial court
could ignore the possible individual issues and the case could be
resolved on the common legal issue alone.
       However, the relevant question is not what Woods intended
to argue but rather what persons the class contains. If a class
were certified and the case were litigated to resolution, class
members who were given notice and did not opt out would be
bound by the outcome. (See Fireside, supra, 
40 Cal.4th atp. 1083.)1 Unless the individual expectations of class members


      1 Indeed, the rule that members of a certified class are
bound by the outcome of the lawsuit is the reason for the
principle that the class certification ruling should precede a
decision on the merits whenever possible. (Fireside, supra, 
40Cal.4th at p. 1081.) Doing so prevents the problem of “ ‘ “ ‘one-
way intervention,’ ” ’ ” where class members may “ ‘ “ ‘elect




                                 10
were considered at trial, class members who actually expected
payment would see their claims extinguished if AFI prevailed.
The trial court properly rejected the invitation to ignore the
individual interests of unnamed class members.2
      Thus, the trial court’s ruling that individual issues would
predominate was reasonable if some class members actually
expected payment and therefore might be considered employees.
      Neither party provided any evidence on the question
whether the class in fact included persons who expected to be
paid. Each of the putative class members who submitted
declarations in support of certification identified himself or
herself as “a former employee” of AFI. Each explained their job
duties and each testified that they were not paid. However, none
stated whether they expected compensation.3


whether to join in the action depending upon the outcome of the
decision on the merits.’ ” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Green v. Obledo (1981)
29 Cal.3d 126, 146–147.)
      2  Doing so might have made class certification
inappropriate for other reasons. If Woods simply abandoned the
claims of unnamed class members, she may not have been an
adequate representative. (See Evans v. Lasco Bathware, Inc.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1417, 1432 [“A proposed representative
must adequately represent the class, and a trial court may
conclude that requirement is not met if the class member ‘fail[s]
to raise claims reasonably expected to be raised by the members
of the class’ ”], quoting City of San Jose v. Superior Court (1974)
12 Cal.3d 447, 464.)
      3AFI provided a declaration from Michael Lumpkin,
Director of AFI Festivals, stating that “[t]o AFI’s knowledge, no
volunteer besides Laurie Woods (when she filed this lawsuit) has




                                 11
       Despite the absence of direct evidence, there was a
reasonable basis for the trial court’s implicit finding that the
class included persons who expected payment. First, as
mentioned, the class definition included all persons who worked
at the AFI Festival and who did not receive payment, regardless
of their expectations. Based on this definition, the class might
include persons with a variety of intentions, including those who
freely volunteered; those who were promised compensation; and
those who believed that they would receive some compensation
based upon particular communications or other individual
circumstances of their work.4


ever demanded payment for volunteering. Rather, AFI’s
understanding is that volunteers know that they are helping the
organization without pay.” Lumpkin’s statement about the state
of mind of all AFI volunteers may fairly be characterized as
speculative. His statement that “to AFI’s knowledge,” no
volunteer had ever demanded compensation could support an
inference that volunteers generally did not expect compensation.
But Lumpkin did not describe the basis for “AFI’s knowledge.”
And, even if true, the lack of any demand for payment of wages
does not foreclose the possibility that some class members
expected some form of compensation that they did not receive.
Especially in light of Woods’s own case theory (described below),
this evidence did not preclude the trial court from reaching a
reasonable conclusion that the class might contain persons who
expected compensation.
      4 Whether a particular class member was actually an
employee might depend upon factors in addition to an expectation
of payment. But whether or not such an expectation of payment
was sufficient to establish an employment relationship, under
AFI’s interpretation of the governing legal standard it was




                               12
      Second, Woods’s own allegations support the conclusion
that the class included persons who expected compensation.
Regardless of what Woods intended to argue at trial, the theory
of her Complaint is that volunteers were duped into working for
AFI through promises of valuable compensation in the form of
event passes that they were never actually given the opportunity
to use. The Complaint alleges that AFI solicited volunteers
“under the false pretense” that they would get to enjoy the event.
The Complaint further alleges that AFI misrepresented the value
of admission to the events, “such that Plaintiff and members of
the putative class reasonably believed such compensation would
have value commensurate with the value of the services rendered
to Defendants.”
      Such allegations of promised compensation, if proved,
might support contract or estoppel theories of employment. As
our Supreme Court has explained, the employment relationship
is fundamentally contractual, “meaning it is governed in the first
instance by the mutual promises made between employer and
employee. [Citations.] The promise to pay money in return for
services rendered lies at the heart of this relationship.” (Voris v.
Lampert (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1141, 1148 (Voris).) However, “[e]ven
in the absence of an explicit promise for payment, the law will
imply one, and thus authorize recovery, when circumstances


necessary. (Cf. Talley v. County of Fresno (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th
1060, 1083 (Talley) [“The existence of remuneration alone does
not prove an individual is an employee . . . , but the lack of
remuneration precludes such a finding”].) Thus, individualized
proof would be required to determine at least if class members
expected compensation, and perhaps to determine other
characteristics of employment as well.




                                13
indicate that the parties understood the employee was not
volunteering his or her services free of charge.” (Ibid.)
       Third, Woods bore the burden to establish the “community
of interest” requirement, including the need to show
“ ‘ “predominant common questions of law or fact.” ’ ” (Brinker,
supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1021.) The trial court was permitted to
consider the “ ‘theory of recovery’ ” described in Woods’s own
Complaint in assessing whether Woods had met that burden.
(Id. at pp. 1021–1022.) That theory suggested that individual
class members might have claims that they were employees
based upon their own expectations in agreeing to work for AFI.
Thus, the trial court properly considered the governing legal
standard in concluding that common issues would not
predominate at trial.
       Quoting Hall v. Rite Aid Corp. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 278,
Woods argues that “at the class certification stage, as long as the
plaintiff’s theory of liability is amenable to resolution on a
classwide basis, the court should certify the action for class
treatment even if the plaintiff’s posited theory is ultimately
incorrect at its substantive level.” (Id. at p. 293.) In Hall, the
court concluded that a class could be certified despite a dispute
between the parties concerning the proper interpretation of the
rule governing the employment practice at issue.5 However, in
that case, the court concluded that common issues would
predominate regardless of which party’s interpretation of the

      5 The interpretation issue was whether section 14 of Wage
Order No. 7-2001—which requires an employer to make seats
available to employees depending on the nature of the work—
should be analyzed based on an employee’s job as a whole or in
relation to specific common tasks.




                                14
governing standard was correct. (Id. at pp. 294–295.) As
discussed above, that is not the case here. Thus, unlike in Hall,
Woods’s theory of liability here was not amenable to resolution on
a classwide basis.
       b.     The trial court correctly found that class
              members were not employees if they did not
              expect compensation
       To determine whether common issues would predominate,
the trial court needed to analyze the applicable law only to the
extent of deciding whether AFI was precluded from using
volunteer labor as a matter of law. If so, then the legal standard
would not be an impediment to deciding liability on a common
basis, because each member of the class would theoretically be
entitled to compensation.6 However, if AFI was not precluded
from using volunteer labor as a matter of law, then the trial court
would need some mechanism for determining whether individual
class members were volunteers or employees.
       The trial court correctly concluded that AFI was not
precluded from using volunteer labor as a matter of law. The
trial court’s reasoning was broad. As mentioned, the trial court
concluded that “both employment and independent contractor
relationships always contemplate an expectation of monetary
compensation in exchange for services rendered.” (Italics added.)



      6  Even if the legal standard permitted proof on a classwide
basis that class members were employees, other obstacles to
certification might remain, such as the trial court’s alternative
findings concerning individual issues associated with proof of lost
wages and missed meals and breaks. Because of our disposition,
we need not consider these other potential obstacles.




                                15
       There is some support in the cases for this general
conclusion. As explained above, our Supreme Court has stated
that the “heart” of the contractual employment relationship is the
“promise to pay money in return for services rendered.” (See
Voris, supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 1148.) In addition, several Courts of
Appeal have decided that the receipt of compensation is a
threshold requirement for a person to be considered an employee
under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA,
Gov. Code, § 12900 et seq.). (See Talley, supra, 51 Cal.App.5th at
p. 1083 [“[t]he common law factor analysis utilized by federal and
California courts alike, in the context of the FEHA and other
similar antidiscrimination statutes, considers remuneration a
dispositive threshold factor to determine whether an individual
may qualify as an employee”]; Mendoza v. Town of Ross (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 625, 637 (Mendoza) [“compensation of some sort
is indispensable to the formation of an employment
relationship”]; Estrada v. City of Los Angeles (2013) 
218Cal.App.4th 143, 151 (Estrada) [same].)
       However, we need not decide whether the trial court was
correct in suggesting that the expectation of compensation is a
necessary condition to be an employee in all contexts. We need
only consider whether persons may volunteer for an organization
such as AFI without becoming employees.
       i.    Volunteers for nonprofit entities are not
             employees
       The Labor Code does not provide a direct answer to the
question whether the minimum standards that protect employees
under California law must be extended to those who volunteer
their time for nonprofit organizations. The article of the Labor
Code that governs the payment of wages defines the terms




                                16
“wages” and “labor,” but does not define “employee.” (See Lab.
Code, § 200.)7 Section 1194—which establishes the right for “any
employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the
legal overtime compensation” to sue for the unpaid balance—also
“does not define the employment relationship nor does it specify
who may be liable for unpaid wages.”8 (Flowers v. Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2015) 
243Cal.App.4th 66, 74.) Rather, as discussed further below,
“[s]pecific employers and employees become subject to the
minimum wage requirements only through and under the terms
of wage orders promulgated by the [Industrial Welfare
Commission (IWC)], the agency formerly authorized to regulate
working conditions in California.” (Ibid.)
       But the Labor Code does contain several analogous
provisions supporting the conclusion that volunteers for nonprofit
entities are not employees for purposes of the wage and hour
rules. For example, California’s “prevailing wage law” (§ 1720
et seq.) is a minimum wage provision that applies to those
employed on “public works.” (Busker v. Wabtec Corp. (2021) 11
Cal.5th 1147, 1153.) This law was among those adopted during
the Great Depression to “ensure that workers employed on public
building programs would be paid daily wages commensurate with


      7Subsequent undesignated statutory references are to the
Labor Code.
      8Section 1194 applies “[n]otwithstanding any agreement to
work for a lesser wage.” Woods cites this provision as support for
the proposition that the right to be paid the minimum wage
cannot be waived. But the section cannot reasonably be read to
prohibit volunteer labor. An agreement to work “for a lesser
wage” is not an agreement to work for no wage.




                                17
those prevailing in the local area for work of a similar character.”
(Id. at p. 1155.) Like California’s wage and hour provisions, the
prevailing wage law is intended to prevent employers from taking
unfair advantage of workers. One of the law’s goals is to
“ ‘protect employees from substandard wages that might be paid
if contractors could recruit labor from distant cheap-labor
areas.’ ” (Id. at p. 1156.)
       Section 1720.4 states that the prevailing wage law does not
apply to “[a]ny work performed by a volunteer.” (§ 1720.4, subd.
(a).) A volunteer is a person “who performs work for civic,
charitable, or humanitarian reasons for a public agency or
corporation qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code as a tax-exempt organization, without promise,
expectation, or receipt of any compensation for work performed.”
(Ibid.)
       Similarly, section 3352 excludes volunteers from the scope
of the workers’ compensation law. That section defines
“employee” to exclude any “person performing voluntary service
for a public agency or a private, nonprofit organization who does
not receive remuneration for the services, other than meals,
transportation, lodging, or reimbursement for incidental
expenses.” (§ 3352, subd. (a)(9).)
       Finally, as discussed above, cases have also interpreted
“employee” for purposes of the FEHA to exclude volunteers. (See
Mendoza, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 629 [volunteer community
service officer for a city]; Estrada, supra, 
218 Cal.App.4th atp. 145 [volunteer municipal police reserve officer].)
       In addition to these analogous statutory provisions, the
language, history, and purpose of the IWC wage orders also
support the conclusion that persons may volunteer for nonprofit




                                18
entities without becoming employees. Wage order 12 (Wage
Order), the relevant wage order here, governs wages, hours, and
working conditions in the motion picture industry. (See Cal.
Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11120.)9 The Wage Order defines “employee”
simply as “any person employed by an employer.” An employer is
one who “directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other
person, employs or exercises control over the wages, hours, or
working conditions of any person.” And “employ” means to
“engage, suffer, or permit to work.” (Wage Order, subds. (2)(D),
(2)(E) & (2)(F).) These definitions are included in all IWC wage
orders governing California industries. (Dynamex, supra, 4
Cal.5th at p. 926, fn. 9.)
       Our Supreme Court interpreted this wage order language
in Martinez v. Combs (2010) 49 Cal.4th 35 (Martinez). In that
case, the court considered whether produce merchants who
contracted with a strawberry farmer could be considered
employers of the farmer’s workers. (Id. at pp. 42–44.) The court
explained that California’s wage orders were the result of
legislation passed in 1913 that created the IWC in the context of
“widespread public recognition of the low wages, long hours, and
poor working conditions under which women and children often
labored.” (Id. at p. 53.) The “ ‘suffer, or permit to work’ ”
language in the wage orders was adopted from language in use



     9 “In California, wage orders are constitutionally
authorized, quasi-legislative regulations that have the force of
law.” (Dynamex Operations W. v. Superior Court (2018) 
4 Cal.5th903, 914, fn. 3 (Dynamex). We analyze the meaning of the Wage
Order de novo. (Gonzalez v. Downtown LA Motors, LP (2013) 
215Cal.App.4th 36, 44.)




                               19
throughout the country to reach “irregular working
arrangements” for employing child labor. (Id. at pp. 57–58, 69.)
The language means that a “proprietor who knows that persons
are working in his or her business without having been formally
hired, or while being paid less than the minimum wage, clearly
suffers or permits that work by failing to prevent it, while having
the power to do so.” (Id. at p. 69.)
       The definition of “ ‘employer’ ” as one who “ ‘exercises
control’ ” over wages, hours, or working conditions “by its terms
imposes liability on multiple entities who divide among
themselves control over those different aspects of the
employment relationship.” (Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 67.)
Combined with the term “engage,” “[t]o employ, then, under the
IWC’s definition, has three alternative definitions. It means:
(a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working
conditions, or (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage,
thereby creating a common law employment relationship.” (Id. at
p. 64.)
       Thus, the history of the definitions of “employ,” “employee,”
and “employer” in the Wage Order suggests that the Wage Order
was meant to apply to persons who are working for pay in
commercial businesses. The “suffer or permit to work” and
“exercises control” standards extend responsibility to businesses
who benefit from and have the power to prevent exploitation of
workers who are working for compensation. And the term
“engage” reaches businesses that form an express or implied
contractual relationship to compensate persons whom they hire.
       The purpose of the work standards in the IWC wage orders
also suggests that those standards apply to businesses who
employ workers for pay. In Dynamex, our Supreme Court




                                20
explained that the “exceptionally broad suffer or permit to work
standard in California wage orders finds its justification in the
fundamental purposes and necessity of the minimum wage and
maximum hour legislation in which the standard has
traditionally been embodied. Wage and hour statutes and wage
orders were adopted in recognition of the fact that individual
workers generally possess less bargaining power than a hiring
business and that workers’ fundamental need to earn income for
their families’ survival may lead them to accept work for
substandard wages or working conditions. The basic objective of
wage and hour legislation and wage orders is to ensure that such
workers are provided at least the minimal wages and working
conditions that are necessary to enable them to obtain a
subsistence standard of living and to protect the workers’ health
and welfare.” (Dynamex, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 952.)10
       In addition to protecting workers, the wage orders help to
ensure a level playing field among competitors. Industry-wide
wage orders “are also clearly intended for the benefit of those
law-abiding businesses that comply with the obligations imposed
by the wage orders, ensuring that such responsible companies are
not hurt by unfair competition from competitor businesses that


      10 As Woods correctly observes, the decision in Dynamex
concerned the standard that applies in determining whether
workers should be classified as employees or as independent
contractors for purposes of the IWC wage orders. (
Dynamex,supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 913–914.) While the opinion in that case
is relevant to the proper interpretation of the definitions in the
wage orders, it does not bear directly on the specific issue here,
i.e., whether volunteers for nonprofits should be considered
employees under California law.




                                21
utilize substandard employment practices.” (Dynamex, supra, 
4Cal.5th at p. 952.) Finally, the minimum work standards in wage
orders help to protect the public from the need to assume
responsibility for the “ill effects to workers and their families
resulting from substandard wages or unhealthy and unsafe
working conditions.” (Id. at p. 953.)
       All three of these factors—protecting workers from
exploitation; protecting businesses from unfair competition; and
protecting the public from the need to assist workers who were
compelled to labor for substandard pay or in substandard
conditions—apply to businesses that employ paid labor. They do
not apply to persons who intend to volunteer their time to
nonprofit entities.
       The language of the Wage Order also supports the
interpretation that it applies to persons who work for
compensation. The Wage Order states that it “shall apply to all
persons employed in the motion picture industry, including extra
players, teachers, and welfare workers, whether paid on a time,
piece rate, commission, or other basis.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8,
§ 11120, subd. 1, italics added.) The reference to the mode of
payment suggests an assumption that the workers subject to the
Wage Order are working for pay. The same language appears in
the section defining the scope of the Labor Code chapter
governing wages and working conditions. (See Lab. Code, § 1171
[“The provisions of this chapter shall apply to and include men,
women and minors employed in any occupation, trade, or
industry, whether compensation is measured by time, piece, or
otherwise”], italics added.)
       Importantly, the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement
(DLSE) has also concluded that the IWC wage orders do not




                               22
apply to volunteers who work for nonprofits.11 In 1988, the
DLSE issued an opinion letter (Opinion Letter) explaining that,
for purposes of the IWC work orders, a person who works for a
“religious, charitable, or similar nonprofit corporation” is not an
employee if he or she “intends to volunteer his or her services for
public service, religious, or humanitarian objectives, not as an
employee and without contemplation of pay.” (See
<https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/opinions/1988-10-27.pdf> [as of
Dec. 9, 2021], archived at <https://perma.cc/FWP6-5B33>.)
However, if a person works for a commercial enterprise operated
by such a religious, charitable, or nonprofit corporation (such as a
restaurant or thrift store), the DLSE considers that person to be
an employee. (Ibid.)12 The DLSE has incorporated this opinion
into its Enforcement Policies and Interpretations Manual
(Dec. 2018, § 43.6.7, p. 43-6). (See <https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/
DLSEManual/dlse_enfcmanual.pdf> [as of Dec. 9, 2021], archived
at <https://perma.cc/SSY3-YTKN>.)




      11“The DLSE is the administrative agency authorized to
enforce California’s labor laws, including applicable wage orders.”
(Dynamex, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 945, fn. 18.)
      12  The DLSE’s opinion letters, while not controlling on the
courts, “ ‘ “ ‘ “do constitute a body of experience and informed
judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for
guidance.” ’ ” ’ ” (Brinker, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1029, fn. 11,
quoting Seymore v. Metson Marine, Inc. (2011) 
194 Cal.App.4th361, 369, fn. 5.) “A court may adopt the DLSE’s interpretation if
the court independently determines that the interpretation is
correct.” (Oliver v. Konica Minolta Business Solutions U.S.A.,
Inc. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 1, 27.)




                                23
       ii.    Woods’s arguments are unpersuasive
       Woods does not dispute that some nonprofit organizations
may use volunteer labor. However, she argues that AFI is not
included in the scope of such organizations because it is not a
religious or charitable organization. Woods argues that only
organizations dedicated to helping the poor or the “ ‘needy or
suffering’ ” fall within the category of charitable organizations
that may use volunteers according to the Opinion Letter.
       The language in the Opinion Letter is not so limited. The
letter refers to volunteers working for “public service, religious, or
humanitarian objectives” in a “religious, charitable, or similar
nonprofit organization.” (Italics added.) Woods acknowledges
that this language is apparently derived from section 1720.4.
That section defines “volunteers” more directly as those who work
for “civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons for a public agency
or corporation qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code as a tax-exempt organization.” (Lab. Code,
§ 1720.4, subd. (a), italics added.) There is no dispute here that
AFI is a tax-exempt, Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3)
organization.
       Other than her strained interpretation of the DLSE
Opinion Letter, Woods does not provide any support for her
argument that only organizations serving the needy may use
volunteers under California law. Consider the implications.
Under Woods’s interpretation, local community theatre
organizations, community orchestras, and other cultural
nonprofit entities would be required to treat all their workers as
employees, even if those workers were dedicated to the mission of
the organization and wished to volunteer their time. Such a rule
would have unforeseen and potentially devastating financial




                                 24
implications for such groups. Woods’s interpretation lacks any
legal support or policy justification, and we reject it.
       Woods also argues that AFI does not qualify to use
volunteers because it is not organized for a “humanitarian”
purpose. In essence, Woods claims that AFI is not a bona fide
nonprofit arts organization but simply exists to promote the films
that it screens and the studios and production companies that
make them.
       But Woods did not provide any evidence to support that
theory. Woods does not dispute that AFI is qualified as a tax-
exempt nonprofit. Nor did she provide any evidence that AFI
engaged in promotional or marketing activities that were
inconsistent with its tax-exempt status.13 She points only to
evidence that AFI receives money for its Festival from various
corporate sponsors and from companies who produce the films
that it screens.
       Such evidence is not sufficient to show that AFI is a
commercial promotional entity rather than a qualifying
nonprofit. Again, consider the implications. Under Woods’s
theory, a publisher’s contributions to a book fair or a musical

      13  To the contrary: The contracts between AFI and the
Festival sponsors that Woods submitted in support of her class
certification motion suggest that AFI sought to remain within the
bounds of promotional conduct that was permitted for an Internal
Revenue Code section 501(c)(3) organization. Sponsors agreed
that, in recognition of AFI’s tax-exempt status, “AFI’s name and
AFI Marks . . . cannot be utilized without written authorization
by AFI and will not be utilized so as to create the impression that
AFI is endorsing, or is otherwise promoting, Distributor or its
products as such an endorsement or promotion could jeopardize
AFI’s tax exempt status.”




                                25
instrument company’s donations to a music festival might
preclude the use of volunteers for those events. And any
payments by a commercial entity in return for sponsor
recognition would likewise force such events to use paid
employees only. Woods provides neither legal nor factual support
for her argument that AFI must be treated as a commercial
business entity for purposes of its obligations to its workers.
       We need not, and do not, decide the obligations of such
commercial entities. We note the DLSE’s opinion that charitable
entities may not use volunteers when they operate commercial
enterprises suggests that the DLSE interprets the IWC wage
orders to apply to all persons working in commercial ventures.
(Opinion Letter, p.1.) The Opinion Letter does not explain the
reason for this interpretation. Presumably it reflects a concern
that commercial employers could take advantage of workers who
agree to forgo pay in the hope of securing future paid employment
or other career benefits.
       Woods argues that the demand for career opportunities in
the film industry creates just such a concern. Other courts have
considered similar concerns in the context of deciding whether
unpaid interns should be considered employees. (See, e.g., Glatt
v. Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. (2d Cir. 2015) 811 F.3d 528, 535(Glatt) [“employers can . . . exploit unpaid interns by using their
free labor without providing them with an appreciable benefit in
education or experience”].)
       Whether this concern is sufficient to justify treating unpaid
interns or other volunteers in commercial businesses as




                                26
employees may be subject to debate.14 But we do not find it
compelling here. AFI is not a for-profit commercial business.
Consistent with the DLSE’s Opinion Letter, we hold only that
persons may volunteer for nonprofit entities, including arts
organizations such as AFI, without becoming employees under
California law.




      14 For example, the Fair Employment and Housing Council
has issued a regulation defining “ ‘[u]npaid interns and
volunteers’ ” for purposes of the FEHA which concludes that
“[u]npaid interns and volunteers may or may not be employees.”

under California law]; but see Mendoza, supra,

       Plaintiffs Medallion Film, Pelican Point Capital Partners
(Pelican Point), Jesse Kennedy, Shad Quraishi, and Ike Suri
appeal from the judgment in favor of Loeb & Loeb following the
trial court’s order granting a special motion to strike their first
amended complaint. (Code Civ. Proc.,1 § 425.16.) We vacate the
judgment, reverse the order granting the special motion to strike,
and remand with directions to enter a new order denying the
motion.
      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
       In 2014, William Sadleir, as the manager of Clarius Capital
Group (Clarius), entered into a consulting fee agreement with
plaintiffs Medallion Film and Pelican Point providing that
Medallion Film and Pelican Point would assist Clarius in
obtaining funding for film projects, and Clarius would pay them a
portion of any funding so obtained. Clarius agreed not to directly
conduct business or transactions with any of the contacts to
whom it was introduced by Medallion Film and Pelican Point.
Medallion Film and Pelican Point introduced Clarius to Randy
Robertson at BlackRock, one of their contacts listed in the
agreement.
       Sadleir is alleged to have dissolved Clarius and its affiliate
and subsidiary entities in 2015, and to have formed, with the
assistance of law firm Loeb & Loeb, a new set of corporate
entities under the name Aviron in order to continue marketing
Clarius’s film properties. It is alleged that Sadleir controlled




1     All undesignated statutory references are to the Code of
Civil Procedure.




                                 2
both the Clarius and Aviron entities, and that he transferred
Clarius’s assets to the Aviron entities.
       Later in 2015, Aviron is alleged to have obtained a loan for
its film projects from BlackRock, with a further extension of the
credit arrangement in 2017. When Medallion Film and Pelican
Point learned of this funding in 2017, they allegedly contacted
Sadlier, who denied any affiliation between Aviron and Clarius
and said he was solely an employee of Aviron.
       On March 25, 2018, plaintiff Quraishi, Pelican Point’s co-
founder, sent an email to Randy Robertson at BlackRock. This
message read, “Randy hope all is well. [¶] We have a fee
agreement with Bill Sadle[i]r based upon monies raised from
Blackrock thru my introduction to you. What can you do to assist
us here in collecting what is due to us. [¶] Jesse [Kennedy, of
Medallion] will provide a reconciliation. As you know our
financial models were provided to you and Blackrock on the P&A.
[¶] Let us know so we don[’]t have to litigate and can resolve the
matter in an amicable fashion. [¶] Thx.”
       Loeb & Loeb learned of the Quraishi email request to
Robertson. On March 28, 2018, Loeb & Loeb partner Bernard
Given II wrote a letter to Quraishi and Kennedy on behalf of
Aviron Capital. Given described Quraishi’s email to Robertson as
a threat of legal action, and wrote, “Aviron has no legal
connection to Clarius Capital Group, LLC whatsoever. It is not a
successor in interest and there is no common ownership between
the two companies. Mr. Sadleir, who signed the referenced
agreement on behalf of Clarius Capital Group, is an Aviron
employee with no ownership interest in Aviron. Had Mr. Sadleir
left Clarius to work at Sony Pictures Entertainment, for example,
your claim for payment to you by Sony, had it received funding




                                 3
from BlackRock, would be equally without merit. [¶] Any further
communication by you to Randy Robertson or anyone else at
BlackRock regarding this matter will be considered by Aviron to
constitute tortious interference.”
      Plaintiffs allege Given knew these representations were
false when he made them because Loeb & Loeb had assisted in
the formation of the Aviron entities, registered several of them on
Sadleir’s behalf, advised Sadleir with respect to Aviron and
Clarius, and represented Aviron when it obtained funding from
BlackRock in 2015. Plaintiffs allege Given intended for
Medallion Film and Pelican Point to rely on his false
representations to conclude they were not entitled to payment
under their agreement with Clarius.
      Plaintiffs allege they believed Given’s representations that
Aviron and Clarius were unaffiliated, Sadleir was merely an
Aviron employee, and they were not entitled to payment based on
the agreement. However, in December 2019, they learned, from
documents related to litigation between BlackRock and
Sadleir/Aviron, that Given’s representations were false.
      Plaintiffs sued Loeb & Loeb in December 2021. The first
amended complaint alleges causes of action for fraudulent
misrepresentation, deceit by concealment, negligent
misrepresentation, aiding and abetting fraud, and violating
California Business and Professions Code section 17200.2 The
plaintiffs attached to the first amended complaint, inter alia, the
following documents:

in Aviron Group as collateral;

which Sadleir is identified as chairman, the companies’ business
models are described in similar terms, and a number of
management personnel are the same for both companies;

Aviron entities’ structure, ownership, control, and agreements
with BlackRock;
      --A 2019 preliminary injunction in the BlackRock litigation,
prohibiting Sadleir and the Aviron entities from holding
themselves out as manager of, or controlling, or purporting to
control, the operations of Aviron Capital and Aviron Pictures;
      --BlackRock’s 2020 amended complaint alleging Sadleir had
created a sham entity and used it to siphon millions of dollars
from BlackRock’s Multi-Sector Income Trust for his personal use

2020 by Sadleir to an officer at Medallion, in which Sadleir
confirmed he still owned the Aviron entities in their entirety.




                                6
I.    The Anti-SLAPP Motion
        Loeb & Loeb filed a special motion to strike the first
amended complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public
participation under section 425.16 (an “anti-SLAPP” motion).
Loeb & Loeb claimed the plaintiffs’ causes of action were all
based on the representations in Given’s letter, and they arose
from protected activity because the letter had been “sent in
express response to Plaintiffs’ threat of legal action to recover
amounts purportedly due under the Consulting Fee Agreement,
and therefore in connection with a contemplated lawsuit.”
        Loeb & Loeb argued plaintiffs could not establish a
probability of success on their claims. First, Loeb & Loeb
asserted the litigation privilege provided an absolute defense to
all of the causes of action because Given’s letter was sent “in
direct response to Quraishi’s email threatening legal action,” with
the belief that plaintiffs “were actually contemplating litigation,
seriously and in good faith,” and the alleged misrepresentations
related to plaintiffs’ “anticipated claims for fees.” Second, Loeb &
Loeb contended the causes of action were barred by the three-
year statute of limitations. Even applying the discovery rule,
because plaintiffs suspected in 2018 that Sadleir controlled
Aviron, plaintiffs were obligated to investigate. Their
investigation was “minimal at best,” as they only contacted
Sadleir and BlackRock, then stopped inquiring about payment
upon receiving Sadleir’s denial and Given’s letter. This, Loeb &
Loeb claimed, was not reasonable diligence as a matter of law.
        Loeb & Loeb argued that if plaintiffs had searched publicly
available records and made record requests, with “a few simple
internet searches,” they would have found a press release and
Canadian government filings relating to an unrelated company’s




                                 7
dealings with Aviron, several online articles, and Aviron’s
website, and they would “readily have discovered not only that
Sadleir controlled Aviron, but also all of the other information
that was supposedly ‘unearthed’ during the BlackRock lawsuit.”
Given all that plaintiffs knew or should have discovered through
investigation, Loeb & Loeb argued their causes of action accrued
in March 2018 and were time-barred as a matter of law.
       Third, Loeb & Loeb contended plaintiffs could not prove
justifiable reliance on Given’s representations as a matter of law
because it is unreasonable to rely on an adversary’s
representations under California law. Because plaintiffs believed
Sadleir controlled Aviron and they were therefore entitled to
payment under the consulting agreement, even “threaten[ing]
legal action on that basis,” it was unreasonable as a matter of law
for them to accept and rely on Sadleir and Given’s denials
without independent inquiry.
       Finally, Loeb & Loeb claimed the cause of action for aiding
and abetting fraud was barred by the agent’s immunity rule.
       The special motion to strike was supported by various
documents and Given’s declaration. He stated he wrote the letter
in response to Quraishi’s “threat of legal action, which I [Given]
regarded as having been made in serious and good faith
contemplation of litigation.” Given declared he believed his
statements in the letter to be true at the time based on
confidential communications and information received in the
course of representing Aviron.
II.   Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the Anti-SLAPP Motion
      In their opposition to the special motion to strike, plaintiffs
argued Loeb & Loeb had not met its burden of showing the claims
arose from protected activity because Given’s conduct was




                                 8
unlawful as a matter of law and no litigation was seriously being
contemplated in good faith at the time he wrote his letter. Even
if the claims did arise from protected activity, plaintiffs argued
they had a probability of success on the merits because the
litigation privilege did not attach to Given’s letter, as litigation
was at most a future possibility and Given had not sent the letter
in good faith and in serious consideration of litigation.
       Plaintiffs argued the statute of limitations had not expired
because their claims did not accrue until December 2019, when
BlackRock sued Aviron and Sadleir. In support of this argument,
plaintiffs submitted evidence that they relied on Given’s
representations to believe they were not entitled to payment
because of “Loeb’s sole access at the time to the material facts
regarding Sadleir’s business dealings and the relationship
between the Aviron and Clarius Entities.” They declared they
later learned from documents from the BlackRock litigation that
Given had known his representations in the March 2018 letter to
be false. The documents revealed Loeb & Loeb knew Sadleir
controlled the Aviron entities because the firm had advised
Sadleir with respect to the BlackRock funding.
       Plaintiffs also argued they had demonstrated justifiable
reliance on Given’s representations, and the agent’s immunity
rule did not apply.
III.   The Trial Court’s Ruling
       On July 12, 2022, the trial court granted the special motion
to strike. With respect to the first prong of the anti-SLAPP
analysis, whether the claim arises from protected activity, the
court found all plaintiffs’ causes of action arose from Given’s
letter. The court found plaintiffs’ evidence was “certainly not
insubstantial and raises a reasonable doubt as to whether Given




                                 9
was truly ignorant of his letter’s falsity.” However, for activity to
be considered unprotected unlawful conduct, the illegality of the
conduct in question must be conceded or conclusively established
by the evidence, neither of which was the case; and because no
showing of good faith/serious consideration of litigation was
required, Loeb & Loeb met its burden of demonstrating the letter
was sent in connection with anticipated litigation.
       On the second prong, the court concluded plaintiffs had not
demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits because
the litigation privilege barred each cause of action. Although this
was dispositive of the motion, the court analyzed the remaining
prong 2 arguments “for discussion purposes” and concluded the
causes of action were not barred by the statute of limitations,
there was no evidence plaintiffs’ investigation could have
revealed Given’s representations were false, and the agent’s
immunity rule did not apply.
       At the hearing, the trial court said it did not like the result
and it believed the outcome was “probably not” fair. The court
encouraged plaintiffs to appeal because if Given knowingly and
maliciously lied, plaintiffs “should be able to sue them for that.”
       The trial court struck the first amended complaint in its
entirety and entered judgment in favor of Loeb & Loeb. Plaintiffs
appeal.
                           DISCUSSION
I.    The Anti-SLAPP Law
      “The anti-SLAPP statute is ‘designed to protect defendants
from meritless lawsuits that might chill the exercise of their
rights to speak and petition on matters of public concern.
[Citations.] To that end, the statute authorizes a special motion




                                 10
to strike a claim “arising from any act of that person in
furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech under
the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in
connection with a public issue.” (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)’ ” (Bonni
v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1008–1009
(Bonni).)
       Litigating an anti-SLAPP motion is a two-step process.
“First, ‘the moving defendant bears the burden of establishing
that the challenged allegations or claims “aris[e] from” protected
activity in which the defendant has engaged.’ [Citation.] Second,
for each claim that does arise from protected activity, the plaintiff
must show the claim has ‘at least “minimal merit.” ’ [Citation.]
If the plaintiff cannot make this showing, the court will strike the
claim.” (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
       We review de novo a trial court’s order granting an anti-
SLAPP motion, considering the pleadings and affidavits
submitted in support of, or in defense to, the subject claims.
(Flickinger v. Finwall (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 822, 831
(Flickinger).)
II.   First Prong
       The first question is whether the plaintiffs’ claims arise
from protected activity. To determine this, we “ ‘consider the
elements of the challenged claim and what actions by the
defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis
for liability.’ [Citation.] The defendant’s burden is to identify
what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those
acts are protected under a statutorily defined category of
protected activity.” (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
       Loeb & Loeb asserts the causes of action are all based on
activity protected by section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). We




                                 11
independently determine whether any of the acts from which
challenged claims arise are protected under this provision.
(Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
      A.    Applicable Law
       Section 425.16, subdivision (e) identifies four categories of
conduct that are protected under the anti-SLAPP statute, one of
which is a “written or oral statement or writing made in
connection with an issue under consideration or review by a
legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law.” (§ 425.16, subd. (e)(2).) Although
the statute refers to ongoing proceedings, as this court and many
others have held, “[p]relitigation communications may qualify for
this protection so long as they ‘ “concern[] the subject of the
dispute” and [are] made “in anticipation of litigation
‘contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.’ ” ’ ”

Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1268.)
       Loeb & Loeb disputes the existence of the good faith and
serious consideration requirement, relying on RGC Gaslamp,
LLC v. Ehmcke Sheet Metal Co., Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 413



                                12
(RGC Gaslamp), in which the court cast doubt on its
appropriateness in the prong 1 analysis; and Pech v. Doniger
(2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 443 (Pech), which did not set forth an
independent analysis but described RGC Gaslamp’s analysis as
persuasive. Loeb & Loeb overstates the scope and import of these
decisions: in neither case did the court rule the good faith and
serious consideration requirement no longer exists to determine
whether prelitigation activity is protected. (Pech, at p. 463
[“Ultimately, the RGC Gaslamp court was not required to decide
whether the additional limitations of the litigation privilege
apply in the anti-SLAPP context, and neither are we”]; RGC
Gaslamp, at p. 429 [“We need not resolve this potential tension
here”].) “An appellate decision is not authority for everything
said in the court’s opinion but only ‘for the points actually
involved and actually decided.’ ” (Santisas v. Goodin (1998)
17 Cal.4th 599, 620.)
       We respectfully disagree with the interpretation of the good
faith and serious consideration requirement in RGC Gaslamp
and Pech. The RGC Gaslamp court was troubled by what it
identified as a “potential tension” between considering whether
prelitigation communications were made in good faith and
serious consideration of litigation and the fact that prong 1 of the
anti-SLAPP analysis “requires only a prima facie showing of
protected activity, not a showing that the defendant’s acts were
ultimately lawful or constitutionally protected.” (RGC Gaslamp,
supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 429.) It expressed concern that
requiring a litigant to “affirmatively show that its statements
were made in good faith while litigation was seriously
contemplated” would, in some instances, import into prong 1 an




                                13
analysis on the merits whether the statements ultimately arose
from protected petitioning activity. (Ibid.)
       We understand this concern but think it misconstrues the
showing of good faith and serious consideration of litigation that
is required. “The ‘good faith [and under] serious consideration’
requirement is not a test for malice. (Aronson v. Kinsella (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 254, 266, [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 305].) Instead, it
focuses on whether the litigation was genuinely contemplated”
(Anapol, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at p. 824), and it protects
prelitigation communications made in genuine contemplation of
litigation while excluding from protection communications made
when litigation is “just a negotiating tactic or a hypothetical
possibility. [Citations.] [¶] The requirement to show that
litigation is seriously contemplated ensures that prelitigation
communications are actually connected to litigation and that
their protection therefore furthers the anti-SLAPP statute’s
purpose of early dismissal of meritless lawsuits that arise from
protected petitioning activity. (§ 425.16, subd. (a); Anapol, supra,211 Cal.App.4th at p. 824 [the good faith and serious
consideration requirement ‘guarantees that hollow threats of
litigation are not protected’]; cf. Action Apartment [Assn., Inc. v.
City of Santa Monica (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232,] 1251 [the policy
underlying the litigation privilege of affording ‘ “the utmost
freedom of access to the courts” ’ is furthered only if litigation is
‘seriously considered’].)” (Bel Air, supra, 20 Cal.App.5th at
pp. 940–941.)
       Additionally, RGC Gaslamp and Pech involved prelitigation
activities that were intrinsically preparatory to litigation such
that no analysis of surrounding circumstances was necessary to
determine that they were protected prelitigation activity. In




                                 14
Pech, the communication was legal advice provided by attorneys
to their clients concerning proposed litigation and the clients’
obligations to their former attorney, which by definition was
provided in preparation for litigation and was therefore protected
prelitigation speech. (Pech, supra, 75 Cal.App.5th at p. 462.) In
RGC Gaslamp, the prelitigation communication in question was
the filing of a mechanic’s lien, and the court concluded that
because the filing of a mechanic’s lien was a necessary
prerequisite to bringing a foreclosure action, it was a protected
prelitigation statement preparatory to filing a judicial
proceeding. (RGC Gaslamp, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 426.)
       Finally, we note that even as it questioned the good faith
and serious consideration analysis in general, the RGC Gaslamp
court recognized its utility in circumstances when determining
whether an act was in anticipation of litigation is not as cut and
dried as it is with a mechanic’s lien: “[S]uch criteria may be
helpful in evaluating prelitigation statements that do not
intrinsically anticipate litigation.” (RGC Gaslamp, supra,
56 Cal.App.5th at p. 429.)
      B.    Application
       From a review of the amended complaint, it is clear that
plaintiffs’ first three causes of action, for fraudulent
misrepresentation, deceit by concealment, and negligent
misrepresentation, are all based on Given’s letter. Plaintiffs’
fourth cause of action is somewhat different, and we discuss it
separately below.
       We independently review the contents of Loeb & Loeb’s
letter (Trinity, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1005) and conclude
Given’s representations were not communications made in
preparation for or in anticipation of litigation. From the first




                                15
sentence of its appellate brief, Loeb & Loeb repeatedly and
hyperbolically describes the email to which Given responded as
an explicit threat of litigation conclusively establishing Given’s
letter as anticipating litigation. But the actual message to which
Given was responding was nothing of the sort. This was not a
demand letter or litigation threat, and it was not even directed to
Aviron. Rather, plaintiffs reached out to their contact at
BlackRock—the person to whom they had introduced Sadleir
pursuant to the consulting agreement—and asked for
BlackRock’s help in securing the payment to which they thought
they were entitled: “What can you do to assist us here in
collecting what is due to us[?]” They sought BlackRock’s help so
the question of payment could be addressed informally, “so we
don[’]t have to litigate and can resolve the matter in an amicable
fashion.” The email demonstrates the plaintiffs just wanted to be
paid, and they were appealing to whomever they thought would
be influential in persuading Sadleir to pay them without having
to resort to litigation. This is the exact opposite of a threat of
litigation.
       While eventual litigation was a remote possibility from the
mere fact that the message alerted Given that someone wanted
something from Aviron, a remote possibility is not enough to
demonstrate a communication is actually connected to litigation
and is therefore protected. When conduct “ ‘will lead to litigation
only if negotiations fail or contractual commitments are not
honored, future litigation is merely theoretical rather than
anticipated and the conduct is therefore not protected
prelitigation activity.’ ” (Rubin, supra, 66 Cal.App.5th at p. 499.)
Indeed, “where one party to a contract requests the other party to
perform its duties under the agreement,” the “possibility of




                                16
litigation in the event of nonperformance is not enough to
conclude the claim is made in anticipation of litigation
contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.”
(Anapol, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at p. 828.)
        Given declared he wrote the letter in response to Quraishi’s
“threat of legal action, which I regarded as having been made in
serious and good faith contemplation of litigation.” This self-
serving declaration is both insufficient on its own to establish a
prima facie showing of protected activity (Anapol, supra,
211 Cal.App.4th at p. 830; Nirschl, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at
p. 403 [“one side’s subjective belief that negotiations will fail or
that litigation will likely occur is insufficient, standing alone, to
transform statements made in a prelitigation negotiation into
protected activity”]) and at obvious odds with the actual
correspondence forwarded to Given. Once we dispense with the
fiction that plaintiffs’ email to BlackRock was an explicit threat
of litigation against Aviron, Loeb & Loeb offers no evidence that
Given wrote his letter in good faith and serious contemplation of
litigation. Given did not declare he was seriously and in good
faith contemplating litigation when he made his alleged
misrepresentations; and he had no reason to believe litigation
would result from the communications here because the parties
“could well have negotiated a settlement and obviated any need”
for litigation. (Mission Beverage Co. v. Pabst Brewing Co., LLC
(2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 686, 704.) Given’s bombastic and
disproportionate response to an email not even directed to his
client is not a communication made in good faith and serious
contemplation of litigation but an attempt to dissuade the
plaintiffs from making any further inquiries.




                                 17
      We conclude Given’s letter was not prelitigation conduct
protected under the anti-SLAPP statute.
      C.    Fourth Cause of Action
       Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action, for aiding and abetting
fraud, is predicated on different conduct. In this claim, plaintiffs
contend Loeb & Loeb “knew that Sadleir was going to commit
fraud against Plaintiffs because they represented Sadleir as well
as the Aviron Entities and Clarius Entities in transactional and
litigation matters. In fact, Defendant[] assisted with the
formation of the Aviron Entities and ultimately advised Sadleir
on the BlackRock funding. Defendant[] [was] therefore privy to
Sadleir’s plan to form the Aviron Entities to continue marketing
and distributing film projects that he initially undertook through
the Clarius Entities. [¶] Defendant[] helped Sadleir form the
Aviron Entities to continue marketing and distributing film
projects that he initially undertook through the Clarius Entities,
with the knowledge and intention that formation of the Aviron
Entities was done, in part, to avoid Sadleir’s contractual
obligation to pay Plaintiffs pursuant to the Consulting Fee
Agreement.”
       This allegedly wrongful conduct precedes Given’s letter and
has no connection to protected activity; in this cause of action, the
letter is essentially the external-facing cover-up of Loeb & Loeb’s
previous actions aiding and abetting Sadleir’s fraud. While the
cause of action is not a model of clarity, as it pivots from these
allegations to allegations of reliance on Given’s representations,
this cause of action nonetheless alleges Given aided and abetted
Sadleir’s alleged fraud by means of wrongful conduct entirely
separate from the later letter.




                                 18
       In their anti-SLAPP motion, Loeb & Loeb made no effort to
demonstrate that this conduct was protected activity. In fact,
they did not acknowledge these allegations, instead asserting
that each cause of action “seeks to hold Loeb liable for statements
made by Given in his March 28, 2018 correspondence” and that
“[t]he only thing Loeb is alleged to have done is to send a single
letter on behalf of Aviron, its client.” Therefore, while we hold
the causes of action were not subject to dismissal under the anti-
SLAPP law because Given’s letter was not protected prelitigation
activity, we hold that dismissal of the fourth cause of action in its
entirety was error for the additional reason that it contains
allegations of nonprotected conduct that survive any anti-SLAPP
analysis. (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1010; Baral v. Schnitt
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 393, 396 (Baral) [an anti-SLAPP motion
may be used to attack parts of a count as pleaded; unprotected
activity is disregarded and the anti-SLAPP analysis is performed
with regard to the protected activity].) “[B]y its very terms,
section 425.16 does not apply to activity that is not in furtherance
of the constitutional rights of free speech or petition.” (Flatley v.
Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 324.)
III.   Second Prong
       While our conclusion that the causes of action asserted in
the amended complaint arise from conduct that is not protected is
determinative of this appeal, we discuss the second prong
because even if Loeb & Loeb did carry its burden to make a prima
facie showing that the claims alleged in the amended complaint
arose from protected activity, the plaintiffs made the requisite
showing of merit required by the statute to survive the special
motion to strike. This is equally and independently sufficient to
demonstrate the anti-SLAPP motion should have been denied.




                                 19
“[W]e may conclude a contested portion of an anti-SLAPP motion
should be denied solely based on a plaintiff’s showing of merit, as
a sufficiently meritorious claim cannot be struck regardless of
whether it arises from activity the anti-SLAPP statute protects.”
(Serova v. Sony Music Entertainment (2022) 13 Cal.5th 859, 872.)
       The Supreme Court has stated, “If the defendant makes the
required showing [on prong 1], the burden shifts to the plaintiff
to demonstrate the merit of the claim by establishing a
probability of success. We have described this second step as a
‘summary-judgment-like procedure.’ [Citation.] The court does
not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its
inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally
sufficient claim and made a prima facie factual showing sufficient
to sustain a favorable judgment. It accepts the plaintiff’s
evidence as true, and evaluates the defendant’s showing only to
determine if it defeats the plaintiff’s claim as a matter of law.
[Citation.] ‘[C]laims with the requisite minimal merit may
proceed.’ ” (Baral, supra, 1 Cal.5th at pp. 384–385, fn. omitted.)
       Loeb & Loeb argues the plaintiffs cannot show a probability
of prevailing on the merits because their claims are barred as a
matter of law by the litigation privilege, the statute of
limitations, and the absence of justifiable reliance. We find Loeb
& Loeb has not defeated plaintiffs’ claims as a matter of law.
      A.    Litigation Privilege
       “A plaintiff cannot show a probability of prevailing on the
merits of a cause of action for anti-SLAPP purposes where the
cause of action is barred by the litigation privilege codified in
Civil Code section 47. [Citations.] ‘The litigation privilege
precludes liability arising from a publication or broadcast made
in a judicial proceeding or other official proceeding. “ ‘The usual




                                   20
formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication
(1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants
or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects
of the litigation; and (4) that [has] some connection or logical
relation to the action.’ [Citation.] The privilege ‘is not limited to
statements made during a trial or other proceedings, but may
extend to steps taken prior thereto, or afterwards.’ [Citation.]”
[Citation.] The litigation privilege is interpreted broadly in order
to further its principal purpose of affording litigants and
witnesses the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear
of harassment in derivative tort actions. [Citation.] The
privilege is absolute and applies regardless of malice.’ ”
(Flickinger, supra, 85 Cal.App.5th at p. 840.)
       “A prelitigation communication is privileged only when it
relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under
serious consideration.” (Action Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of
Santa Monica, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 1251.) The privilege
“ ‘arises at the point in time when litigation is no longer a mere
possibility, but has instead ripened into a proposed proceeding
that is actually contemplated in good faith and under serious
consideration as a means of obtaining access to the courts for the
purpose of resolving the dispute.’ ” (Haneline Pacific Properties,
LLC v. May (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 311, 319.) It does not apply
to statements made “simply as a tactical ploy to negotiate a
bargain.” (Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp. (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 15, 36 (Edwards).)
       We are not persuaded Given’s letter is protected by the
litigation privilege. Given’s representations did not relate to
litigation that was contemplated in good faith and under serious
consideration. The premise of Loeb & Loeb’s litigation privilege




                                 21
argument is that the plaintiffs’ email was an explicit threat of
litigation, and from that they reason their letter responded to
that explicit threat of litigation and was therefore written in
anticipation of that threatened litigation, satisfying the good
faith and serious consideration requirement. But this premise is
incorrect. As discussed above, the email to which Given
responded with his letter did not contain any threat: it was a
request to a third party for help obtaining money the plaintiffs
believed they were owed—in order to avoid litigation.
       At most, the email alerted Given to a potential dispute with
plaintiffs that at some point, if not resolved through negotiation
and mutual agreement, could possibly develop into a lawsuit.
That is not enough to invoke the litigation privilege. (Edwards,
supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at p. 36 [the “mere potential or ‘bare
possibility’ that judicial proceedings ‘might be instituted’ in the
future is insufficient to invoke the litigation privilege”].) As the
Edwards court explained, “In the present litigious society, there
is always at least the potential for a lawsuit any time a dispute
arises between individuals or entities. More than a mere
possibility or vague ‘anticipation’ of litigation must be required
for the privilege to attach, or else the privilege may be misused in
ways for which there is no public policy justification or
purpose. . . . [T]he ‘bare possibility’ that a judicial proceeding
‘might be instituted’ in the future ‘is not to be used as a cloak to
provide immunity’ for fraud and other tortious conduct when the
possibility has not ripened into a proposed judicial proceeding
that is contemplated in good faith and under serious
consideration.” (Id. at p. 33.)




                                22
      B.    Statute of Limitations
       Loeb & Loeb contends the causes of action were barred by
the three-year statute of limitations applicable to fraud claims.
(§ 338, subd. (d).) A cause of action for fraud accrues when the
injured party could have discovered the fraud or mistake through
the exercise of reasonable diligence (Sun’n Sand, Inc. v. United
California Bank (1978) 21 Cal.3d 671, 701, superseded by statute
on other grounds as stated in Mills v. U.S. Bank (2008)
166 Cal.App.4th 871, 883), and actual knowledge is not required
for accrual if “a plaintiff knows facts that should raise suspicion
and trigger a further investigation.” (Vera v. REL-BC, LLC
(2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 57, 69.)
       Loeb & Loeb argues plaintiffs already suspected Sadleir
controlled Aviron in 2017, as demonstrated by their 2017
communication with Sadleir asking about payment. This
suspicion, Loeb & Loeb contends, obligated plaintiffs to
investigate, and their minimal investigation was not reasonably
diligent as a matter of law. Loeb & Loeb argues plaintiffs did not
allege they took any steps “to ascertain Sadleir’s relationship
with Aviron beyond a single inquiry to each of Sadleir and
BlackRock. Plaintiffs do not purport to have searched publicly
available materials, to have requested copies of the financing
agreements or any corporate records, or to have done anything
else to investigate their suspicion” that Sadleir controlled Aviron.
Had plaintiffs searched these materials, Loeb & Loeb represented
to the trial court, “they would readily have discovered not only
that Sadleir controlled Aviron, but also all of the other




                                23
information that was supposedly ‘unearthed’ during the
BlackRock lawsuit.”3
       Specifically, Loeb & Loeb asserted in support of their anti-
SLAPP motion that with “a few simple internet searches,”
plaintiffs would have discovered: (1) a 2015 press release from a
Canadian company, Quizam Media Corporation, announcing it
had signed a letter of intent to acquire an equity interest in
“Sadleir’s new motion picture distribution company,
headquartered in Beverly Hills, California,” of which Sadleir was
presently the only other shareholder; (2) Quizam’s 2015 filing
with SEDAR, which Loeb & Loeb described as the Canadian
equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR
filing system, disclosing it had entered into an agreement with
Sadleir and Aviron to acquire an interest in Aviron; and (3) three
of Quizam’s Consolidated Financial Statements covering the
years 2014 through 2016, and its 2015 Management’s Discussion
& Analysis form, each of which mentioned Quizam investing in
“William Sadleir’s new motion picture distribution company,
Aviron Capital, LLC.” Loeb & Loeb also asserted that plaintiffs
would have found a January 2017 Nasdaq.com article, articles
from May 2017 and November 2017 from Deadline Hollywood,
and Aviron’s website. According to a declaration by Loeb &




3     Perhaps sensing an overstatement, Loeb & Loeb moderated
that assertion on appeal, stating that investigation of publicly
available documents would have told plaintiffs “that Sadleir
exercised at least indirect control over the company.”




                                24
Loeb’s counsel, these articles and website printouts were
attached to the declaration, but they are not in the record.4
       Loeb & Loeb’s argument is unavailing. If the plaintiffs
suspected Sadleir controlled Aviron as of 2017 or their inquiries
in 2018, that would allow a fraud claim against Sadleir to have
accrued at that time. But these are claims against Loeb & Loeb,
based not on Sadleir’s fraud but on Loeb & Loeb’s conduct:
making allegedly false representations about Sadleir, Aviron, and
Clarius, as well as whether the 2014 consulting fee agreement
entitled plaintiffs to payment. Suspecting they might be owed
money under the agreement is not sufficient to put plaintiffs on
notice that a letter from Aviron’s attorney specifically dispelling
that suspicion may have contained false representations.
       Even if plaintiffs were required to investigate Given’s
representations in the letter because before receiving it they
thought they were or could be entitled to payment, there is no
evidence that a reasonable investigation would have revealed


4     According to Loeb & Loeb, one of these articles mentioned
“the October 2015 Share Exchange agreement between Quizam
and Aviron and William Sadleir” (the January 2017 article);
another stated Aviron Pictures had been formed with funding
from “Aviron Capital, a consortium of financiers including
principal William Sadleir” (the May 2017 article); and the third
described Aviron as “a consortium of financiers including
principal William Sadleir, who is chairman/CEO” (the November
2017 article). Loeb & Loeb also described printouts from Aviron
Pictures’s website as identifying Sadleir as “previously CEO of
Clarius Entertainment” and Aviron’s “Chairman & CEO”;
describing the company’s business model in similar terms to that
of Clarius Capital; and identifying various former Clarius
executives as members of Aviron’s senior management team.




                                25
Given had made false representations to them. “The mere fact
that information exists somewhere in the public domain is by no
means conclusive.” (Vega v. Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue (2004)
121 Cal.App.4th 282, 295.) The “reasonable” investigation
proposed by Loeb & Loeb would have involved rooting through
government filings and financial statements made by a Canadian
company, an investigation significantly deeper than the “simple
internet searches” Loeb & Loeb claimed would have yielded this
information. While a single phrase in Quizam’s 2015 press
release did say Sadleir’s new company had no other shareholders,
we are not convinced that plaintiffs should be charged with
locating a single phrase in an unrelated company’s press release
that did not even mention Aviron by name, simply calling it “New
Company.”
       More importantly, none of the documents identified by Loeb
& Loeb would have revealed to plaintiffs that Given’s letter
contained misrepresentations. The Canadian company
documents simply referred to negotiations and an agreement to
acquire an interest in Aviron, referred to as “Sadleir’s new motion
picture distribution company.” While, as noted above, the
Canadian company’s 2015 press release contained a statement
that Sadleir’s unnamed new company had no other shareholders,
his full ownership of Aviron in 2015 does not mean that at other
times Sadleir owned all of Aviron—in fact, the Quizam
documents suggest Sadleir later did not own Aviron in its
entirety, since they announce and concern Quizam’s purchase of
an ownership interest in Aviron. While we were not provided
with the remaining items Loeb & Loeb says a basic investigation
would have uncovered, based on its description of them they
similarly would not have been enough to alert plaintiffs, or any




                                26
reasonable person, that Given’s various representations about
Sadleir, Aviron, and Clarius may have been false.
       We also note that Given declared that at the time he wrote
the letter, he believed his representations were accurate. If
Given, who as Sadleir and Aviron’s attorney had access to not
only all the information in the public record, but also his
“confidential communications with Mr. Sadleir in his capacity as
an Aviron employee and other confidential information that Loeb
received from Aviron in the course of its representation,” was not
able to detect that his statements were false, this both
undermines any claim that plaintiffs should have been on notice
that Given’s statements might be misrepresentations and
strongly suggests they would not, exercising reasonable diligence,
have discovered the letter contained false statements.
       Accepting plaintiffs’ evidence as true, it is reasonable to
conclude plaintiffs were not aware of the alleged
misrepresentations in Given’s letter until the documents were
revealed in the BlackRock litigation. As the trial court noted, the
fact that they did not file suit until those documents became
available is evidence that they had not been aware of the fraud.
The causes of action are not barred by the statute of limitations.
      C.    Justifiable Reliance
      In a rather bleak argument, Loeb & Loeb argues plaintiffs
cannot prove they justifiably relied on Given’s representations
because as a matter of law it was not justifiable to rely on the
representations he made as counsel for Aviron.
      Loeb & Loeb argues it is “not reasonable under California
law for a party to actual or threatened litigation to accept the
other side’s ‘representations as an adversary without an
independent inquiry’ ” (italics omitted), but the case upon which




                                   27
it relies does not stand for such a broad principle. In Wilhelm v.
Pray, Price, Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324,
opposing counsel in pending litigation was alleged to have met
with the plaintiff, an 87-year-old woman, and made false
representations that convinced her to dismiss her pending
litigation. (Id. at pp. 1328–1329, 1331.) The court sustained
demurrers to the operative complaint on multiple grounds, one of
which was that the allegations precluded a showing of actual or
justifiable reliance. (Id. at p. 1332.) The court pointed out that
plaintiff had been represented by counsel, and it stated, “Because
her counsel prepared and filed the dismissal, she must have
consulted with [her counsel] before hand. Also, it would not be
‘reasonable’ for [her] to accept [opposing counsel’s]
representations as an adversary without an independent
inquiry.” (Ibid., italics omitted.)
       While it may not be reasonable for a person represented by
counsel and engaged in litigation to rely on representations made
by opposing counsel about why they should drop their pending
lawsuit, that is not the case here. There was no obvious reason
for plaintiffs to consider Given an adversary. They were not
litigating against one of Given’s clients; they simply asked a third
party for help obtaining money they thought was due to them,
and in return they received Given’s letter making representations
about Sadleir, Aviron, and Clarius and denying plaintiffs had any
entitlement to money under the consulting agreement. As the
situations here and in Wilhelm markedly differ, Wilhelm does not
demonstrate that the plaintiffs could not justifiably rely on
Given’s representations as a matter of law.




                                28
       Loeb & Loeb next cites three federal district court cases
that also do not tend to establish plaintiffs’ reliance was
unjustifiable as a matter of law. Two, Borg v. Principal Life Ins.
Co. (N.D.Cal., July 24, 2008, No. C 07-03149 JW) 2008 WL
11453724 and Facebook, Inc. v. ConnectU, Inc. (N.D.Cal., June
25, 2008, No. C 07-01389 JW) 2008 WL 8820476, state, “Where a
party is represented by counsel, or where the alleged
misrepresentation was made by an adversary during the course
of negotiations, courts have held that reliance is unjustifiable.”
(Borg, at p. *3; Facebook, at p. *5.) There is no evidence that
plaintiffs were represented by counsel on this matter, and Given’s
alleged misrepresentations were not made during negotiations.
In the third case, the plaintiffs were “sophisticated businessmen
who were represented by counsel during the negotiation,
preparation, and execution of [a] merger agreement” and then
alleged fraud during the negotiations. (Scognamillo v. Credit
Suisse First Boston LLC (N.D.Cal., Aug. 25, 2005, No. C03-2061
TEH) 2005 WL 2045807, p. *7.) Given the plaintiffs’
sophistication and representation, the court held they could not
“demonstrate that, in the absence of a fiduciary relationship,
reliance on statements made by individuals on the other side of a
business transaction would have been justified in light of
Plaintiffs’ knowledge and experience.” (Ibid.) Again, that is not
remotely akin to the factual situation here and does not suggest,
let alone establish, that plaintiffs’ reliance was unjustifiable as a
matter of law.
       In Cicone v. URS Corp. (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 194, 205, the
court rejected the proposition that an attorney “ ‘is not justified in
relying on statements of law made by an adverse party or
attorney in the course of arm’s length negotiations,’ ” and the




                                 29
court in Shafer v. Berger, Kahn, Shafton, Moss, Figler, Simon &
Gladstone (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 54, 75, observed that “ ‘cases
from twenty-eight states hold[] that “[a]n attorney can be liable
to a nonclient, even an adversary in litigation, for fraud or
deceit.” ’ ” In Shafer, the attorney for the defendants’ insurance
company misrepresented the scope of the insurance company’s
coverage. (Ibid.) The court ruled the plaintiffs “justifiably relied
on [the attorney’s] alleged false statements. They had no reason
to doubt him. . . . [They] reasonably relied on the coverage
representations made by counsel for an insurance company.”
(Id. at pp. 75–76.)5 Similarly here, accepting plaintiffs’ evidence
as true, they reasonably relied on representations concerning
Aviron’s ownership, control, and obligations made by counsel for
that company.
       Loeb & Loeb claims it was “unreasonable as a matter of
law” for plaintiffs to rely on Given’s representations without
independent inquiry because “plaintiffs actually believed that
Sadleir controlled Aviron and that they were therefore entitled to
payment under the Consulting Fee Agreement, and they
threatened legal action on that basis.” The portions of the record
Loeb & Loeb relies upon to support that assertion do not bear it
out. Loeb & Loeb cites to the email plaintiffs sent to BlackRock,
which does not state or necessarily imply they believed Sadleir
controlled Aviron; and, as we have already discussed, was not a
threat of legal action. Loeb & Loeb also refers the court to the
declarations of Quraishi and Kennedy, both of which describe


5     Loeb & Loeb attempts to distinguish this case by asserting,
inaccurately, that the misrepresentation upon which the Shafer
plaintiffs relied was made by “plaintiff’s own counsel.”




                                 30
Quraishi’s inquiries with Sadleir and BlackRock, and neither of
which establishes they believed Sadleir controlled Aviron and
that this entitled them to payment under the consulting
agreement. This argument does not establish that plaintiffs’
reliance was unjustifiable as a matter of law.
      The reasonableness of reliance is a question of fact, and it
may only be decided as a matter of law “ ‘if reasonable minds can
come to only one conclusion based on the facts.’ ” (Hasso v. Hapke
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 107, 132.) Loeb & Loeb has not
demonstrated that reasonable minds could only conclude the
plaintiffs’ reliance on Given’s representations was unreasonable.
Loeb & Loeb argues “the most basic of inquiries would have
revealed the true facts,” but that both assumes a duty on
plaintiffs’ part to perform this research—a duty Loeb & Loeb has
not established—and fails to answer the question why plaintiffs
would or should have thought they needed to verify the
unsolicited representations about Aviron made by its attorney,
whose knowledge of the company and its structure, ownership,
and obligations was considerably more extensive than theirs.
Moreover, as discussed above, the evidence does not show that if
the plaintiffs had performed the research Loeb & Loeb claims
they should have performed, they would have located information
revealing Given’s representations to them were false. To the
contrary, it strongly suggests that even in the exercise of
reasonable diligence they would not have learned Given had
made misrepresentations to them.
      We agree with the trial court that plaintiffs’ evidence was
“certainly not insubstantial and raises a reasonable doubt as to
whether Given was truly ignorant of his letter’s falsity.”
Plaintiffs submitted evidence that Given made representations of




                               31
important facts to plaintiffs; he knew those representations to be
false at the time he made them, and he intended for plaintiffs to
rely upon them and stop inquiring about payment; and that
plaintiffs believed Given and reasonably relied on his
representations to their detriment, suffering economic damages
as to which the misrepresentations were a substantial cause. In
light of this evidence, and because the claims are not barred as a
matter of law, we conclude the plaintiffs have “made a prima

Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Charles E. Ramos, J.), entered April 19, 2018, which dismissed the second amended complaint (SAC), unanimously affirmed, without costs. Appeal from the orders, same court and Justice, entered March 8, 2018 and March 12, 2018, which granted defendants' motions to dismiss, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as subsumed in the appeal from the judgment.
The court correctly dismissed the SAC because it did not adequately plead an actionable claim for fraud, fraudulent inducement, or negligent misrepresentation against any of defendants. The SAC did not attribute specific misrepresentations or wrongdoing to most defendants (see Marine Midland Bank v Russo Produce Co., 50 NY2d 31, 44-45 [1980]; Fletcher v Dakota Inc., 99 AD3d 43, 49 [1st Dept 2012]), but rather, impermissibly lumped those defendants together with the others against whom specific acts had been pleaded (Jonas v National Life Ins. Co., 147 AD3d 610, 612 [1st Dept 2017]; MP Cool Invs. Ltd. v Forkosh, 142 AD3d 286, 291 [1st Dept 2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 911 [2016]).
Initially, the facts alleged in the SAC do not support a claim of fraud against Colbeck Capital Management, LLC (Colbeck) or David Aho (Pludeman v Northern Leasing Sys., Inc., 10 NY3d 486, 492 [2008]). Aho's alleged statement that plaintiff's investment was ""low risk,"" was a non-actionable expression of hope (see Zaref v Berk & Michaels, 192 AD2d 346, 349 [1st Dept 1993]), and his presentation of slides prepared by Relativity is insufficient to impute representations within the slides to him personally (see Gregor v Rossi, 120 AD3d 447, 447-448 [1st Dept 2014]). Plaintiff also waived any claims based upon representations by Aho by signing specific disclaimers in non-disclosure agreements which renounced any representations regarding the accuracy of any statements made in the introductory investment materials (see Loreley Fin. [*2](Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v Citigroup Global Mkts., 119 AD3d 136, 143 [1st Dept 2014]). The non-disclosure agreements also released Aho and Colbeck Capital Management from liability relating to or resulting from the use of those materials (see Centro Empresarial Cempresa S.A. v America Movil, S.A.B. de C.V., 17 NY3d 269, 277-278 [2011]).
The alleged misrepresentations attributed to defendants Ramon Wilson, Andrew Matthews, and Greg Shamo, officers of Relativity, are similarly insufficient to give rise to a fraud claim. The alleged misrepresentations attributed to these defendants were made after plaintiff had already invested in Relativity, precluding a conclusion that they induced plaintiff to engage in the transaction (Laub v Faessel, 297 AD2d 28, 31 [1st Dept 2002]). To the extent plaintiff claims that these defendants' misrepresentations caused it to abstain from taking legal action, plaintiff has not demonstrated that it sustained damages as a result of such forbearance, an essential element of its claim (Laub, 297 AD2d at 30-31).
To the extent the SAC has attributed specific misrepresentations to defendant Ryan Kavanaugh, the founder and chief executive officer of Relativity, they do not support a claim of fraud. Plaintiff could not have justifiably relied on the misrepresentations regarding Relativity's financial health in agreeing to engage in the investment, as plaintiff, a sophisticated investor, did not demonstrate that it fulfilled its affirmative obligation to verify the nature and quality of its investment (see MP Cool Invs. Ltd., 142 AD3d at 287; Global Mins. & Metals Corp. v Holme, 35 AD3d 93, 100 [1st Dept 2006]).
Insofar as plaintiff relies on the alleged insincere promise that its funds would be used for only print and advertising expenses, we dismiss the fraud claims as disguised claims for breach of contract (see Cronos Group Ltd. v. XComIP, LLC, 156 AD3d 54, 67-68 [1st Dept 2017]). Further, any misrepresentations made after plaintiff had already invested the funds are insufficient to give rise to fraud as there was no nexus between the alleged statements and plaintiff's losses (see Laub, 297 AD2d at 31).
The court properly dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim, as plaintiff has not pleaded the existence of a special or privity-like relationship imposing a duty on defendants to speak with care (see J.A.O. Acquisition Corp. v Stavitsky, 8 NY3d 144, 148 [2007]). A special relationship may be established by ""persons who possess unique or specialized expertise, or who are in a special position of confidence and trust with the injured party such that reliance on the negligent misrepresentation is justified"" (Kimmell v Schaefer, 89 NY2d 257, 263 [1996]). Relying on Brass v Am. Film Tech., Inc. (987 F2d 142, 150 [2d Cir 1993]), plaintiff contends that defendants' ""superior knowledge"" of their intention to use the funds invested by plaintiff for working capital transformed their relationship into a special one giving rise to a duty to disclose. However, we have held that ""superior knowledge of . . . alleged wrongdoing . . . and ...admitted wrongdoing is not the type of unique or specialized expertise that would support a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation"" (Greentech Research LLC v Wissman, 104 AD3d 540, 540-541 [1st Dept 2013]). Further, New York courts have held that arm's length borrower-lender transactions between sophisticated parties do not give rise to privity (see Greenberg, Trager & Herbst, LLP v HSBC Bank USA, 17 NY3d 565, 579 [2011]; Dobroshi v Bank of Am., N.A., 65 AD3d 882, 884 [1st Dept 2009], lv dismissed 14 NY3d 785 [2010]; Sebastian Holdings, Inc. v Deutsche Bank AG., 78 AD3d 446, 447 [1st Dept 2010]).

MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER
Ann M. Donnelly, United States District Judge
In this patent infringement action, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants, Assay Abloy, Inc. and HID Global Corporation, directly, indirectly, and willfully infringed asserted claims in three patents assigned to the plaintiff by inventor Dr. Bjorn Mar-kus Jakobsson: U.S. Patent No. 8,086,866 (the ’866 Patent), United States Patent No. 8,516,262 (the ’262 Patent), and United States Patent No. 8,990,576 (the ’576 Patent) (collectively the Patents-in-Suit). The defendants move to dismiss, claiming that the patents are directed to subject matter that is not patent-eligible, and that the complaint fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The plaintiff opposes. I heard oral argument on February 15, 2017. For the reasons set out below, the defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied.
BACKGROUND
A. Background of the Patented Concept1
The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the ’866 Patent, the ’262 Patent, and the ’576. Patent, entitled “Methods and Apparatus for Efficient Computations of One-Way Chains in Cryptographic Applications,” on December. 27, *6752011, August 20, 2013, and March 24, 2015, respectively.
The Patents-in-Suit relate generally to the field of cryptography, a field of mathematics targeted to the secure sharing of information. Applications include, among other things, encryption and decryption, digital signatures, and device authentication. Here, the Patents-in-Suit address a technique for reducing the computation difficulty and storage capacity demands in using one-way chains on “lightweight” processing devices, like mobile telephones and smartcards.2 The Patents-in-Suit include apparatus, computer-readable medium, and method claims.
By way of background, a one-way function refers to a scheme that is easy to compute but hard to invert.3 For some cryptographic applications, it is advantageous to use a one-way chain. A chain in this context refers to a series of values, which may be used to “increment time.” However, the conventional use of a one-way chain necessitates either storage of all values or computation by an iterated application of the function. Thus, if no values are stored, then the computation requires an amount of work proportional to the length of the chain. This creates significant storage and computation demands.
The Patents-in-Suit describe a method for finding values in a one-way chain that facilitates computation of other values in a one-way chain, and thus reduces the necessary storage or computation. The patented approach is to use “helper values” or “pegs” to reduce the computation requirements, and to move the pegs to appropriate positions in the chain, so that the efficiency gains are repeated for each chain output value. Below, Figure 2B is an example one-way chain computation process consistent with the patented method:
*676[[Image here]]
 
Claim 1 of the ’866 patent reads:
1. A method implemented by a processor, the processor being coupled to a memory, the memory having a designated amount of storage available for storing values of a one-way chain, the designated amount of available storage being less than that required to store simultaneously all of the values of the one-way chain, the method comprising the steps of:
storing in the memory a subset of the values of the one-way chain as helper values for facilitating computation of other values of the one-way chain not in the subset, the subset of values of the one-way chain comprising a plurality of designated nonconsecutive values of the one-way chain;
utilizing one of the values in the subset of values to compute one of the other of the one-way,chain not in the subset;
generating a cryptographic output determined by the computed value not in the subset; and
updating the stored subset of values of the one-way chain so as to replace at least one of the helper values with a new helper value not previously part of the subset.
(’866 Patent, cl. 1.) To the extent that this patented method improves the storage and computational efficiency of a one-way chain computation process, it also increases the efficiency of any application that uses one-way chain computation. However, nothing in the claims or patent descriptions limits the implementation of the method to a specific type of device.
*677B. Allegations in the Complaint
According to the plaintiff, the defendants’ CoreStreet-branded and Activlden-tity-branded products — which the defendants “make[], use[], offer[] to sell, or sell[]” — infringed the Patents-in-Suit,4 in that the products, upon information and belief, provided certificate validation features “in part through'the use of efficient one-way chain computation techniques of the type developed by Dr. Jakobsson and described by the' Patents-in-Suit.”5 (Compl. ¶ 20.)
The, plaintiff concedes that it, did not reverse engineer the CoreStreet and Acti-vldentity products in order to establish that they used the computation technique covered by the Patents-in-Suit; according to the plaintiff, the CoreStreet and Activl-dentity products were sold subject to an agreement prohibiting buyers from reverse engineering the products. (Compl, ¶ 28.)
In addition to the direct infringement claim, the plaintiff brings claims for indirect infringement. The plaintiff argues that by advertising, selling, licensing, or supporting the products, the defendants induced others to infringe the Patents-in-Suit. (Compl. ¶¶39, 48, 60.) ‘Additionally, the plaintiff contends that by selling the products, the defendants contributed to the infringement of the Patents-in-Suit by customers and end-users, who use the Cor-eStreet and Activldentity products for certificate validation. (Compl. ¶¶ 37, 49, 61.) The/plaintiff alleges upon information and belief that the defendants’ Activldentity and CoreStreet products “have no substantial use outside of the context of certificate validation, which functionality is implemented in such products using efficient one-way chain computation techniques of the type ... described and claimed in the Patents-in-Suit.” (Compl, ¶ 31.)
Finally, the plaintiff contends that the defendants’ infringement was willful under two separate theories. First, the plaintiff points out that four patents,6 referred to in this memorandum as the ASSA-Patents— for which the defendants’ parent company, ASSA Abloy AB, is the current assignee— acknowledge that the techniques developed by Dr. Jakobsson provide a “surprising time/storage tradeoff.” (Compl. ¶ 13.) Thus, according to the plaintiff,-the defendants knew or should have known that their products infringed the Patents-in-Suit.
Second, the plaintiff maintains that-the defendants knew of the specification and issued ■ claims of the Patents-in-Suit, because the plaintiff sent the defendants letters in February, May, and December' of 2015, identifying the Patents-in-Suit, the citations to Dr. Jakobsson’s work in the ASSA Patents, and “suggestions in one or more of the ASSA Patents to utilize effi*678cient one-way chain computation techniques of the type developed by Dr. Ja-kobsson and described and claimed in the Patents-in-Suit.” (Compl. ¶¶ 23-25.) In the May and December, 2015 letters, the plaintiff specifically asked whether the defendants’ products “incorporated techniques based on the aforementioned ‘surprising time/storage tradeoff attributed to Dr. Ja-kobsson in one or more of the ASSA Patents.” (Compl. ¶26.) According to the plaintiff, the defendants did not respond. (Compl. ¶ 27.)
C. Procedural History
The plaintiff filed this action on April 8, 2016 to enjoin infringement and obtain damages for the defendants’ alleged infringement of claims 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 17-19 of the ’866 Patent; claims 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 17 of the ’262 Patent; and claims 1-4, 6, 9 and 13-20 of the ’576 Patent. (See Compl. ¶¶ 35, 47, 59.)
The defendants answered and sought a pre-motion conference regarding their anticipated motion to dismiss on June 16, 2016. (ECF Nos. 14, 15.). After a pre-motion conference on July 7, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. I heard oral argument on February 15, 2017.7 For the reasons set out below, the defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied.
DISCUSSION
A. Patent-Eligibility of the Subject Matter Under 35 U.S.C. § 101
The defendants move to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the Patents-in-Suit are invalid for failing to claim patent-eligible subject matter. See 35 U.S.C.A. § 101.
Patent validity under Section 101 is a question of law. See DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Because patent-eligibility under Section 101 is a threshold question, it may be considered properly on the pleadings. See In re TLI Commc’ns LLC Patent Litig., 823 F.3d 607 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (concluding patented process was abstract, and thus patent-ineligible, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss); Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC, 772 F.3d 709 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (finding patented material ineligible for protection on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss). Additionally, under certain circumstances, the court may determine Section 101 validity prior to formal claim construction. Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. Ass’n, 776 F.3d 1343, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“Although the determination of patent eligibility requires a full understanding of the basic character of the claimed subject matter, claim construction is not an inviolable prerequisite to a validity determination under § 101.”).
The plaintiff contends that I should apply the presumption of validity, and impose upon the defendants the “burden of establishing invalidity of a patent,” 35 U.S.C. § 282, by clear and convincing evidence. (Pl.’s Mem at 6-7 (citing Multimedia Plus, Inc. v. Playerlync, LLC, 198 F.Supp.3d 264, 266-67 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)).) The defendants oppose the application of the “clear and convincing” standard to the Section 101 inquiry. (Defs.’ Mem. at 8 (ECF No. 21-1).)
I agree with the defendants that the “clear and convincing” standard has no place in resolving a Rule 12 motion, which was brought on the basis that the patent recites ineligible subject matter. In general, courts do not consider evidence outside *679the pleadings in resolving a motion to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings. Thus, application of the “clear and convincing standard” — a burden of proof — is not logically sound. See Modern Telecom Sys. LLC v. Earthlink, Inc., No. SA CV 14-0347-DOC, 2015 WL 1239992, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 17, 2015).
This view is consistent with the weight of authority, which suggests that the presumption of validity does not apply in the Section 101 context. See Ultramercial, 772 F.3d at 720-21 (Mayer, J., concurring) (“Although the Supreme Court has taken up several section. 101 eases in recent years, it has never mentioned — much less applied — any presumption of eligibility. The reasonable inference, therefore, is that while a presumption of validity attaches in many contexts ... no equivalent presumption of eligibility applies in the section 101 calculus.”); OpenTV, Inc. v. Apple, Inc., No. 14-CV-01622-HSG, 2015 WL 1535328, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 6, 2015) (declining to apply presumption of eligibility to Section 1010 consideration); California Inst. of Tech. v. Hughes Commc’ns Inc., 59 F.Supp.3d 974, 979 n.6 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (“This Court believes that the clear and convincing evidence standard does not apply to § 101 analysis, because § 101 eligibility is a question of law.”); Modern Telecom Sys., 2015 WL 1239992, at *7 (“clear and convincing evidence standard is not necessarily applicable in the context of determining patent-eligibility under § 101, which is a question of law”); but see Easy-web Innovations, LLC v. Twitter, Inc., No. 11-cv-4550-JFB-SIL, 2016 WL 1253674, at *25 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2016) (applying validity presumption to Section 101 inquiry). Moreover, although the Supreme Court has considered many Section 101 cases in the past few years, it has not. applied the “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating whether a claim is patent eligible pursuant to Section 101. See Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l, — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2347, 189 L.Ed.2d 296 (2014); Ultramercial, 772 F.3d 709; see also OpenTV, Inc., 2015 WL 1535328, at *3 (collecting cases).
The defendants, as the parties moving to dismiss, still bear the burden of demonstrating that the claims are not patent eligible under Section 101. In evaluating whether the claims are patent-eligible, I construe the claims in' a “manner most favorable” to the plaintiff. See Content Extraction & Transmission, 776 F.3d at 1349.
Under Section 101 of the Patent Act, the ambit of patentable discoveries includes “any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” 35 U.S.C.A. § 101. However, it is well established that “this provision contains an important implicit exception: Laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.” Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2354 (citation omitted); see also Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 132 S.Ct. 1289, 1293, 182 L.Ed.2d 321 (2012).
The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the two step analysis set out in Mayo for “distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, arid abstract ideas from those that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts.” Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2355. Specifically, the court must first determine whether the claims at issue are-- directed to laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. Ultramercial, 772 F.3d at 714. If so, the court must consider whether the claims — both individually and as an ordered combination — include an element that is sufficient to transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application. *680Id.; Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2355; Mayo, 132 S.Ct. at 1297-98.
The Supreme Court has cautioned that courts should “tread carefully in construing” the exceptions to Section 101 “lest [they] swallow all of patent law.” Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2354 (citation omitted). This admonition reflects that “[a]t some level, all inventions-... embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas.” Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2354 (internal quotas tion marks-and citation omitted); see also. Ultramercial, 772 F.3d at 715 (use of an advertisement as currency was an abstract idea).
In determining whether the claims of the Patents-in-Suit are directed to an abstract idea — the first step of the Alice analysis — the court must identify the purpose of the claims, which is crucial to a meaningful resolution of the Section 101 inquiry. California Inst. of Tech., 59 F.Supp.3d at 991; see also Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (describing claims at too high a level of abstraction “and untethered from the language of the claims all but ensures that the exceptions to § 101 swallow the rule.”); cf. Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 189 n. 12, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 (1981) (overgeneralizing claims, “if carried to .its extreme, make[s] all inventions unpatentable because all inventions can be reduced to underlying principles of nature which, once known, make their implementation obvious”).
In this case, the parties disagree about the nature of the claims of the Patents-in-Suit. The defendants characterize the patented ideas as “directed to computing values of a one-way chain,” (Defs.’ Mem. at 15 (ECF No. 21 — 1)), while the plaintiff maintains that the claims:
reeite[ ] a method implemented by a particular type of computer, namely a processor coupled to a memory having a designated amount of .storage available for storing values of a one-way chain, where the designated amount of available storage is less than that required to store simultaneously all of the values of the one-way chain. Claim 1 provides improvements in the functionality of that computer, through the particular combination of method steps recited, including storing,; utilizing and updating of helper values. Such a combination of limitations was not known ip the prior art.
(PL’s Mem. at 8 (ECF No. 22).) For purposes of the first step of the Alice inquiry, it is sufficient to say that the claims of the Patents-in-Suit are drawn to computation of values’ in a one-way chain by storing, using, and updating helper values. '
■ While the complaint lists allegedly infringing claims from the Patents-in-Suit, the parties .do not distinguish meaningfully between the claims in setting out their characterizations of the claims. The Federal Circuit has held that the district court need not address each claim of the asserted patents individually. Content Extraction & Transmission, 776 F.3d at 1348. Instead, if the district court determines that the:claims are substantially similar and linked to the same abstract idea, the court may consider a representative claim. Id. In this case, while the Patents-in-Suit recite apparatus, computer-readable medium, and method claims, in practical effect, the claims cover the same concept related to the efficient .computation of hash values in a one-way chain. Consequently, the claims warrant similar substantive treatment. CLS Bank Int’l v. Alice Corp. Pty., 717 F.3d 1269, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2013), aff'd, — U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2347, 189 L.Ed.2d 296 (2014).
Because there is no conclusive method of determining what constitutes an *681“abstract idea that meets the first step of the Alice framework, courts compare the claims at issue to those claims from previous cases, already determined to be directed to an abstract idea. Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1334. “Distinguishing between claims that recite- a patent-eligible invention and claims that add too little to a patent-ineligible abstract concept can be difficult, as the line separating the two is not always clear.” DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1255. This difficulty is particularly pronounced in the context of patent claims related to computer technology. See id.; see also Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., No. 13-cv-3777-AKH, 2015 WL 1941331, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2015); cf. Diehr, 450 U.S. at 194, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (patent law developments in response to new computer technology are of “recent vintage”).
In applying the Alice framework to computer technology,' courts have treated two types of computer technology patents differently.
In the first line of cases, the Supreme Court and lower courts applying Mayo, Alice, and their progeny, have repeatedly held that the use of á computer to implement a fundamental economic dr conventional business practice does not, by itself, render the claims patent' eligible. Put another way, Alice stood'for the proposition that claims directed to the “same activity” in which “humans engaged ... long before the invention of computers” were not patent eligible. Paone v. Broadcom Corp., No. 15-cv-0596-BMC-GRB, 2015 WL 4988279, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 19; 2015) (citation omitted). In Alice, the patent claims at issue merely instructed the user to “implement-the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer,” and were therefore patent ineligible. Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2359. In Ultramercial, 772 F.3d at 715-16, the Federal Circuit found patent-ineligible the abstract idea of using advertising as currency on the Internet. The claims in buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 765 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2014), were patent ineligible because they were drawn to merely using a computer to send and receive information over a network in order to implement the abstract idea of creating a “transaction performance guaranty.” Id. at 1355.
However, in a second line of cases, the Federal Circuit has held that some developments in computer-related technology, in which the focus of the claims is on solutions' “necessarily rooted in computer technology in order to overcome a problem specifically arising in the realm of computer networks,” DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1257, or on “improvement to computer functionality itself,” are not directed to an abstract idea. Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1336.
A divided three-judge panel in DDR Holdings affirmed the district court’s decision denying judgment as a matter of law after a' trial, and held that the idea to retain website visitors by combining the look and feel of a host website with product information from a third-party merchant’s website was patent eligible. DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1257. The majority noted that while the claims involve both a computer and the Internet, they “do' not merely recite the performance of some business practice known from the pre-In-ternet world along with the requirement to perform it on the Internet.” Id. Rather, the patents describe a method, based in computer technology, for solving a problem that specifically arises in the arena of computer technology. Id. Thus, the subject matter of the patent was distinguishable from those held patent ineligible in Ultramercial and buySAFE, among others. Id. at 1258-59.
The Federal Circuit took up a similar issue in Enfish. There, a unanimous three-*682judge panel reversed the lower court’s decision granting summary judgment on Section 101 grounds. Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1329. The case concerned infringement of a patent covering software that included a self-referential table for a computer database. Id. at 1332. In determining that the claims were not directed merely to the abstract idea of “storing, organizing, and retrieving memory in a logical table,” the court noted that the self-referential table functioned differently than a conventional database, and increased flexibility, generated faster search times, and required less memory. Id. at 1337. Because the panel determined that the self-referential table was “a specific type of data structure designed to improve the way a computer stores and retrieves data in memory,” the claims were not directed to an abstract idea. Id. at 1339.
Most recently, in In re TLI Commc’ns LLC Patent Litig., 823 F.3d 607, the Federal Circuit affirmed a district court’s decision to dismiss a complaint on Section 101 grounds, because the patent-in-suit claimed no more than the abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in an organized way. Id. at 609. The Federal Circuit rejected the plaintiffs contention that the claims were directed to a specific improvement to computer functionality. Id. at 612. Rather, the court found that the claims were “directed to the use of conventional or generic technology in a nascent but well-known environment, without any claim that the invention reflects an inventive solution to any problem presented by combining [a camera with a cellular telephone].” Id. at 612.
In this case, the defendants urge that the claims in the Patents-in-Suit were directed to the abstract ideas of “(1) storing values, (2) computing additional values and data, and (3) storing a new value in the place of one of the previously stored values.” (Defs.’ Mem. at 13 (EOF No. 21-1).) However, as the Federal Circuit observed in Enfish, “describing the claims at such a high level of abstraction and untethered from the language of the claims all but ensures that the exceptions to § 101 swallow the rule.” Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1337; see also Diehr, 450 U.S. at 189 n.12, 101 S.Ct. 1048 (warning that overgeneralizing claims “if carried to its extreme, make all inventions unpatentable because all inventions can be reduced to underlying principles of nature which, once known, make their implementation obvious.”).
The Patents-in-Suit recite a method for calculating the values of one-way chains that reduce the requirements for storage or computation capacity. The plaintiff maintains and the patents recite that conventional techniques for computing values of one-way chains were known in the art, but necessitated storing all values ahead of time or computing the values as needed. This conventional approach involved a significant drawback, in that it was either storage or computation intensive. The Patents-in-Suit describe the use of “helper values” or “pegs” to reduce computation demands, and a process to move the pegs to various positions in the one-way chain, so that the efficiency gains are repeated for each chain output value. According to the plaintiff, this is an improvement upon conventional methods for computing values in a one-way chain.
The storage and computation difficulty posed by the conventional process for computing values in a one-way chain was a computer-centric problem. The Patents-in-Suit are specifically directed to a technique that solves that problem and improves the functioning of a computer.8 In fact, the *683concept recited in the Patents-in-Suit seems to be the paradigmatic example described in DDR Holdings for computer technology claims that are patent-eligible under Section 101, namely “an invention as technologically complex as an improved, particularized method of digital -data compression.” DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1259.
In light of the line of cases instructing that patents directed to improvements in computer functionality do not fail under Section 101,1 conclude that the Patents-in-Suit are not directed- to a patent ineligible abstract idea. Nonetheless, because there is not yet a developed evidentiary record, and because some of the cases to consider the patent eligibility, of computer-related technology focus on Alice step two, I turn to consideration of the second step.9 Cf. Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1339 (cases in which there are close calls about how to characterize computer-related claims may be considered properly at step two).
Under step two of the Alice test, the court must consider whether the elements of the claims, both individually and “as an ordered combination” include an “inventive concept,” that is “sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.” Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2355. I conclude that the patent claims include an “inventive concept,” such that the idea is not patent-ineligible under Section 101.
In ascertaining whether a process claim recounts an abstract idea, the court must evaluate the claim as a whole, keeping in mind that a concept is not ineligible just because it relies on a mathematical formula. This is because an application of a mathematical formula to a process may be deserving of patent protection. Diehr, 450 U.S. at 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048; see also Digitech Image Techs., LLC v. Elecs. for Imaging, Inc., 758 F.3d 1344, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2014). However, a claim that recites an abstract idea does not become eligible merely by adding the words “apply it.” Bancorp Servs., L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada (U.S.), 687 F.3d 1266, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2012), (citing Mayo, 132 S.Ct. at 1294.). Likewise, a claim does not warrant patent protection merely by reciting “apply it with a computer.” Alice Corp., 134 S.Ct. at 2358; see also Content Extraction & Transmission, 776 F.3d at 1348.
The defendants maintain that the Patents-in-Suit are categorically abstract because they are directed to the field of cryptography. (Defs.’ Mem. at 14-15 (ECF No. 21-1).) This is not so.
Two district court cases are instructive. In this district, in Paone v. Broadcom Corporation, 2015 WL 4988279, the Honorable Brian Cogan took up the question of whether claims describing computer-implemented methods of encrypting data may be directed- to patent-eligible subject matter. As an initial matter, Judge Cogan opined that a “patent on a method of data encryption is not per se invalid, as long as it is specific enough.” Id., at *5. In rejecting the defendants’ argument that the patent described -the abstract idea- of “authenticating authorship” by “executing a cryptographic operation using a cryptographic key,” Judge Cogan characterized the claims as an invention that improved upon existing block cipher technology by *684“changing] the encryption key for each data block, based on additional, randomly generated data.” Id., at *4. Judge Cogan concluded that the patent did not merely involve the encryption of data, but rather “claims ■ a specific method of doing so,” and was thus patent eligible. Id., at *7.
In TQP Dev., LLC v. Intuit Inc., No. 2:12-cv-180-WCB, 2014 WL 651935 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 19, 2014), the Honorable William Bryson determined that a patent of a use of a predetermined characteristic of data being transmitted to trigger the generation of new key values for the use in encryption and decryption in a data communication system was patent eligible. Id., át *3, *7. Judge Bryson noted that limitations in the claim so narrowed it that the preemptive effect was “very much diminished.” Id., at *4. “Because the claim [was] drawn to a very specific method of changing encryption keys, it. contain[ed} an ‘inventive concept,’ ... and [was] a far cry from something that could fairly be characterized as a ‘basic tool[ ] of scientific and technological work.’ ” Id. (citing Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 67, 93.S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273 (1972)).
The same can be said here. In this case, the concept at issue is .not merely the use of a one-way chains, or the conventional process for computing values in a one-way chain. Instead, the Patents-in-Suit describe a method for placing and relocating pegs in a one-way chain, in order to reduce the computation or storage required for -computing the values in- a one-way chain. This additional limitation on the process of computing values in a one-way chain is not simply a “trivial appendix to the underlying abstract idea.” CLS Bank Int’l, 717 F.3d at 1283. Rather, and taking the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the Patents-in-Suit set out an inventive process that improves upon existing technology.
Under the present procedural posture, the defendants have not established that the claims are patent-ineligible under Section .101.
B. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim
The defendants also seek to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it does not allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for direct or indirect infringement, or that the defendants’ allegedly infringing conduct was willful. The pleading applicable pleading standard is the familiar one set out in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) and Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). See Paone, 2015 WL 4988279, at *13.
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a plaintiff to provide “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This demands more than “an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678,129. S.Ct. 1937 (citations omitted). A complaint-that merely “tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement” is not sufficient. Id..
In evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court must accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. Town of Babylon v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, 699 F.3d 221, 227 (2d Cir. 2012). However, the principle that “a court must accept a complaint’s allegations as true is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action’s elements, supported by mere conclusory statements.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. A complaint will only survive a motion to dismiss if the law recognizes the claims, and if it pleads “enough facts to. state a claim to relief that is plausible on *685its face.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. An allegation is plausible on its face when the plaintiff “pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. “[Dietermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim is- [a] context-specific” task. Id. at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937.
On a motion to dismiss, consideration is “limited to the factual allegations in plaintiffs complaint, which are accepted as true, to documents attached to the complaint as an exhibit or incorporated in it by reference, to matters of which judicial notice may be taken, or to documents either in plaintiffs possession or of which-plaintiff had knowledge and relied on in bringing suit.” Faconti v. Potter, 242 Fed.Appx. 775, 777 (2d Cir. 2007) (alterations and citations omitted).
i Direct Infringement
Direct infringement claims are governed by Section 271(a), which provides “whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within thé United States ... during the term of the patent ... infringes the patent.”10 35 U.S.C.A. § 271(a). In order to prove direct infringement, the plaintiff must establish that a party performed every element of a claimed invention. BMC Res., Inc. v. Paymentech, L.P., 498 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2007) overruled on other grounds by Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., 692 F.3d 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also Advanced Steel Recovery, LLC v. X-Body Equip., Inc., 808 F.3d 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (every limitation set forth in a claim must be found in an accused product).
Until recently, courts analyzed the sufficiency of a complaint alleging direct infringement by comparing the allegations in the complaint with Form 18 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. K-Tech Telecommunications, Inc. v. Time Warner Cable, Inc., 714 F.3d 1277, 1283 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (“to the extent any conflict exists between Twombly (and its progeny) and the Forms regarding pleading requirements,' the Forms control”). Form. 18, which set out the requirements for a pleading alleging direct infringement, required:
(1) an allegation of jurisdiction; (2) a statement that the plaintiff owns the patent; (3) a statement that defendant has been infringing the patent ‘by making, selling, and using [the device] embodying the patent’; (4) a statement that the-plaintiff has given the defendant notice of its infringement; and (5) a demand for an injunction and damages.
K-Tech Telecommunications, 714 F.3d at 1283 (citation omitted). A complaint alleging these elements was essentially immune from attack on the grounds that the pleading was insufficient. Id.
As of December 1, 2015, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure no longer included Form 18. See e.Digital Corp. v. iBaby Labs, Inc., No. 15-cv-05790-JST, 2016 WL 4427209, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2016). As a result of that change, most courts to consider the question have concluded that the Twombly pleading standard now applies to direct infringement claims. See id. (collecting cases). However, the extent' to which a plaintiff must plead direct' infringement element-by-element remains unsettled. Compare Niazi v. Pressure Prod. Med. Supplies, Inc., No. 16-cv-670-JDP, 2017 WL 108114, at *1 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 11, 2017) (declining to require a plain*686tiff to plead direct infringement element-by-element) with Scripps Research Inst. v. Illumina, Inc., No. 16-cv-661-JLS-BGS, 2016 WL 6834024, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2016) (“to adequately plead direct infringement, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to plausibly show that a defendant’s accused instrumentality contains each limitation of .the asserted patent claim.”).
I decline to require that the plaintiff plead direct infringement of each and every element of the allegedly infringed claims. Imposing such a requirement would be inconsistent with the admonition that the court, in considering a motion to dismiss, should draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. At the pleading stage, the plaintiff need only “nudge” its claim “across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 680, 129 S.Ct. 1937.
' In this case, the plaintiff specifically identifies the CoreStreet-branded and Activldentity-branded products, which, according to the plaintiff, directly infringe the Patents-in-Suit. In support, of its direct infringement claim, the plaintiff alleges that these products “generate certificate validation proofs in the manner described in the ASSA Patents, namely, utilizing efficient one-way chain computation techniques of the type developed by Dr. Jakobsson and described and claimed in the Patents-in-Suit.” The plaintiff suggests that the products were designed to include “certificate validation infrastructure features such as extremely low latency and scalability to very large numbers of certificates.” In addition, the plaintiff lists the claims from the Patents-in-Suit that the defendants allegedly infringed. Togeth-’ er, these allegations are sufficient to plead direct infringement.
ii Indirect Infringement
The defendants move to dismiss the claims for indirect infringement — i.e., induced or contributory infringement — on the grounds that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Defs.f Mem. at 21-23 (ECF No. 21-1).)
1. Inducing Infringement
The plaintiff alleges that the defendants induced infringement within the meaning of Section 271(b), which provides, “Whoever actively induces infringement .of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.” 35 U.S.C.A. § 271(b). Induced infringement, unlike direct infringement, is not a strict liability offense. Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc., — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1920, 1926, 191 L.Ed.2d 883 (2015). To state a claim for induced infringement, the plaintiff must allege that the defendants: “(1) had knowledge of the patent-in-suit; (2) knew the induced acts were infringing; and (3) specifically intended to encourage another’s infringement.” Carson Optical Inc. v. eBay Inc., 202 F.Supp.3d 247, 253 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (citations omitted). Said another way, the defendants must induce activity intentionally that they actually knew to be infringing. Glob.-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 765, 131 S.Ct. 2060, 179 L.Ed.2d 1167 (2011).
The complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendants’ end-users engaged in infringing activity. The plaintiff asserts that the defendants sold’ the allegedly infringing CoreStreet and Activldentity products to consumers. A customer’s use of an infringing process is primary infringement. Conair Corp. v. Jarden Corp., No. 13-cv-67020AJN, 2014 WL 3955172, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2014) (citing Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 484, 84 S.Ct. 1526, 12 L.Ed.2d 457 (1964); R. Carl Moy, Moy’s Walker on Patents § 14:32 (4th ed.)). Con*687sequently, while the complaint does not specify instances of direct infringement, it adequately alleges infringing activity by the defendants’ “end users.” Conair Corp., 2014 WL 3955172, at *2; see also Paone, 2015 WL 4988279, at *13 (“Plaintiffs allegations that the ‘end users’ of defendants’ accused products infringe the ... patent are sufficient.”).
Additionally, in light of the fact that the defendants’ products are allegedly infringing, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor, the mere sale of the allegedly infringing product is enough to plead the defendants’ intent to induce their end-users’ infringement. Conair Corp., 2014 WL 3955172, at *3; see also Ricoh Co. v. Quanta Computer Inc., 550 F.3d 1325, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (the defendant’s “role as the designer and manufacturer of the [allegedly infringing devices] may evidence an intent sufficiently specific to support a finding of inducement.”). Finally, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants “continued to make, use, offer to sell, sell, and/or import into the United States” the infringing products after the plaintiff put the defendants on notice of its infringement by sending it letters notifying it of the Patents-in-Suit and inquiring into whether the defendants’ products incorporated the techniques attributed to Dr. Ja-kobsson in the ASSA Patents. This adequately pleads that the defendants had the requisite knowledge.
Accordingly, I conclude that the plaintiff has stated a claim for inducing infringement.
2. Contributory Infringement
The plaintiff asserts that the defendants are liable for contributory infringement. Under Section 271(c), “[w]ho-ever offers to sell or sells within the United States ... a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.” 35 U.S.C.A. § 271(c). To prove contributory infringement, the plaintiff must demonstrate: “1) that there is direct infringement, 2) that the accused infringer had knowledge of the patent, 3) that the component has no substantial noninfringing uses, and 4) that the component is a material part of the invention.” Fujitsu Ltd. v. Netgear Inc., 620 F.3d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2010).
The defendants assert that the complaint is inadequate because it does not allege that the defendants sold a material part of the invention, or that they knew the accused products were adapted for infringing use. The arguments do not succeed for reasons already outlined — the plaintiff adequately alleges direct infringement, and asserts that the defendants sold Activldentity and CoreStreet products, that infringed the plaintiffs Patents-in-Suit that had as their subject the techniques for efficient computation of values in a one-way chain. From those allegations, a reasonable inference can be drawn that the plaintiff expected that customers would use its products and, by doing so, infringe the plaintiffs patent. Further, the complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendants knew about the plaintiffs patents by describing the reference to the Patents-in-Suit in the ASSA Patents and by setting out the letters that the plaintiff sent to the defendants.
The defendants also argue that the plaintiff does not adequately allege that a material part of the Activldentity and Cor-eStreet products lacked non-infringing uses. (Defs.’ Mem. at 22-23 (ECF No. 21-1).) The complaint specifically notes that *688the Activldentity and CoreStreet products “have; no substantial use outside of the-context of certificate validation,” and that this cannot be performed without the efficient one-way chain computation techniques claimed in the Patents-in-Suit. While- this seems conclusory, many courts post-Iqbal have not demanded detailed factual allegations that- the defendants’ products lack - substantial noninfringing uses. Conair Corp., 2014 WL 3955172, at *4 (collecting cases). I - agree with this approach.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim for contributory infringement survives the defendants’ motion to dismiss.
Hi Willful Infringement
Willful infringement requires that the plaintiff plead that the defendants were “aware of the asserted patent but' acted despite an objectively high likelihood that [their] actions constituted infringement of á valid patent.” Paone, 2015 WL 4988279, at *14 (citations omitted); see also i4i Ltd. P’ship v. Microsoft Corp., 598 F.3d 831, 860 (Fed. Cir. 2010), aff'd, 564 U.S. 91, 131 S.Ct. 2238, 180 L.Ed.2d 131 (2011). The complaint adequately alleges that’’the defendants committed acts of infringement with full knowledge of the plaintiffs rights in its'patents.'That is sufficient.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the defendants’. motion to dismiss is denied.

"Syllabus

The trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for relief from a final judgment and decree of divorce because the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in deciding defendant's motion. Civ.R. 60(B) does not apply to a motion for relief from judgment in which the movant claims failure of service of process, which affects the trial court's jurisdiction. Because defendant claimed he was not served with process, the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion based on a failure to comply with the requirements of Civ.R. 60(B) and by not determining whether defendant had been properly served.

BOGGS, J.

        {¶ 1} Defendant-appellant, Yasser Elghadban, appeals the judgment of the
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, denying his
motion for relief from a final judgment and decree of divorce. For the following reasons,
we reverse the trial court’s judgment denying that motion.
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
        {¶ 2}   Plaintiff-appellee, Nancy Abouharga, filed a complaint for divorce from
Elghadban on April 14, 2022, along with a motion for designation of a process server. The
complaint stated that Abouharga and Elghadban resided at the same address: “The parties
have effectively lived separate for the past 18 months, but it is within the same house.”
(Apr. 14, 2022 Compl. at ¶ 4.) The trial court issued an order designating John Hurst as a
process server to personally serve Elghadban with a summons and all pleadings, including
No. 23AP-532                                                                                2


Abouharga’s complaint, affidavits, and documents, and “to make due return of his service.”
(Apr. 20, 2022 Entry and Order on Mot. for Designation of Process Server.)
       {¶ 3} The clerk of courts issued a Personal Service Return, which included space
for the process server to indicate the date of service and the documents served or, if service
was not accomplished, the reason the process server was unable to serve Elghadban. The
Personal Service Return states, “YOU WILL MAKE DUE RETURN OF THIS ORDER BY
THE 28 DAY OF APRIL, 2022.” (Emphasis sic.) (Apr. 20, 2022 Personal Service Return.)
Civ.R. 4.1(B)(2)(a) requires a civil process server, to endorse on the process the fact that a
copy of the process has been served and to “return [the process] to the clerk, who shall make
the appropriate entry on the appearance docket.”
       {¶ 4} Hurst did not complete and file the Personal Service Return with the clerk.
Instead, more than three weeks after the date by which the Personal Service Return was to
be returned to the clerk of courts, a different document, captioned “Return Service,” was
filed with the trial court on May 18, 2022. The document, which contains what purports to
be Hurst’s electronic signature, dated April 21, 2022, states:
              The defendant, Yasser Elghadban, was served the requested
              documents on April 21, 2022, at 1:00pm. Service was
              completed at his residence 2955 Northwest Blvd. Upper
              Arlington, Ohio 43221[.]

              John Hurst, Powel [sic] Detective and Protection Agency, 185
              S. Liberty Street, Powell, Ohio 43065, di[d] serve summons
              and all other pleadings in this matter, including but not limited
              to Plaintiff’s Complaint for Divorce, Plaintiff’s Motion for
              Temporary Restraining Order, Entry Granting Plaintiff’s
              Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Plaintiff’s
              Supplemental Affidavit in Support of Temporary Order
              service[.]

(May 18, 2022 Return Service at 1.)
       {¶ 5} Elghadban did not file an answer to Abouharga’s complaint and did not enter
an appearance.
       {¶ 6} On September 23, 2022, the trial court issued a judgment entry and decree
of divorce following an uncontested final divorce hearing. With respect to Elghadban’s
nonparticipation, the judgment entry stated that Elghadban “was properly served by
No. 23AP-532                                                                                3


private process server,” but he was not present at the divorce hearing and did not file a
responsive pleading. (Sept. 13, 2022 Jgmt. Entry Decree of Divorce at 1.)
       {¶ 7} On November 21, 2022, nearly two months after the trial court issued its final
judgment entry, attorney Craig M. Stewart entered a notice of appearance for Elghadban.
       {¶ 8} On January 30, 2023, Abouharga filed a motion asking the trial court to hold
Elghadban in contempt of court for failing to pay spousal and child support and for failing
to transfer to Abouharga half the value of a Robinhood Crypto LLC account, as ordered in
the final judgment entry and decree of divorce.
       {¶ 9} Elghadban filed his motion for relief from judgment on February 9, 2023,
claiming he had not been served with a summons and a copy of Abouharga’s divorce
complaint. He stated that at 1:00 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon, when service was alleged
to have occurred, he would have been asleep and unable to answer the door, as he worked
on Thursdays from 5:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Elghadban also argued that the divorce decree
was improper because Loc.R. 5 of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic
Relations Division, prohibits the hearing of any divorce action until the parties have lived
separate and apart for at least 30 days, unless that period is waived in the discretion of the
assigned judge. The parties continued to reside together when Elghadban filed his motion
for relief from judgment, and Elghadban argued that there was no indication in the
judgment entry and decree of divorce that the judge had waived the rule’s time
requirement. Elghadban submitted with his motion an affidavit attesting to the
truthfulness of the facts and allegations stated in the motion.
       {¶ 10} Abouharga did not file a memorandum in opposition to Elghadban’s motion,
which the trial court scheduled for a hearing on May 22, 2023. The notices of hearing did
not indicate whether the hearing would consist only of oral arguments or if the parties
would also be entitled to present evidence in support of and in opposition to the motion for
relief from judgment. Elghadban, Abouharga, and their respective attorneys appeared for
the May 22 hearing. Neither Elghadban’s attorney nor Abouharga’s attorney called any
witness or presented any evidence regarding the motion for relief from judgment, even after
the trial court offered them the opportunity to do so. Elghadban’s attorney reiterated the
arguments from the motion that Elghadban had not been served and that the divorce decree
violated the local rule requiring parties to have lived separately for at least 30 days.
No. 23AP-532                                                                                 4


Abouharga’s attorney argued that the appointed process server completed service on
Elghadban, as indicated in the Return Service. He also stated, “my client was home at the
time -- at the point of the service -- and witnessed it,” although there is no direct statement
from Abouharga to that effect in the record. (May 22, 2023 Tr. at 7.) At the conclusion of
the brief hearing1, the trial court took the matter under advisement.
        {¶ 11} The trial court subsequently denied Elghadban’s motion for relief from
judgment. The trial court rejected Elghadban’s argument under Loc.R. 5 of the Franklin
County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, stating that it had clearly
waived the 30-day requirement as a matter of discretion. With respect to Elghadban’s claim
that he was not served, the trial court noted Elghadban’s assertion that he would have been
asleep and unable to answer the door at the time he was claimed to have been served, as
well as Abouharga’s attorney’s contrary “represent[ation] that [Abouharga] witnessed John
Hurst serve” Elghadban. (Aug. 4, 2023 Decision & Jgmt. Entry at 3.) The trial court,
however, did not decide whether Elghadban had been served. Instead, it stated, “[e]ven if
the Court were to find [Elghadban’s] claim that he was not served credible, there is no
evidence before the court to justify [Elghadban’s] untimeliness” in moving for relief from
judgment. Id. at 4. In other words, the trial court denied Elghadban’s motion for relief
from judgment based on his supposed failure to meet the burden of establishing the
timeliness of his motion under Civ.R. 60(B).
        {¶ 12} Elghadban appeals and raises two assignments of error:

                 [1.] THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN
                 DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE BASED ON
                 CIV. R. 60(B).

                 [2.] THE DENIAL OF DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE
                 THE DECREE FOR LACK OF SERVICE IS AN ABUSE OF
                 DISCRETION.

II. ANALYSIS

        A. First assignment of error

        {¶ 13} In his first assignment of error, Elghadban argues that the trial court erred
by applying the wrong legal standard when analyzing his motion for relief from judgment.


1 The transcript of the hearing is less than 10 pages long.
No. 23AP-532                                                                               5


       {¶ 14} The trial court analyzed Elghadban’s motion under Civ.R. 60(B), which sets
out one method for obtaining relief from a final judgment, and correctly noted the
requirements for obtaining relief under that rule. To prevail on a motion under Civ.R.
60(B), the movant must establish: (1) a meritorious claim or defense to present in the event
relief is granted, (2) entitlement to relief under one of the provisions of Civ.R. 60(B)(1)
through (5), and (3) the timeliness of the motion. GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC
Industries, Inc., 47 Ohio St.2d 146 (1976), paragraph two of the syllabus.
       {¶ 15} Civ.R. 60(B) provides a means for obtaining relief from voidable judgments,
but it does not apply when a motion to vacate is premised on jurisdictional grounds. First
Resolution Invest. Corp. v. Davis, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-328, 2005-Ohio-4976, ¶ 9. “Proper
service of process is an essential component in the acquisition of personal jurisdiction over
a party, and a judgment in the absence of personal jurisdiction is void ab initio.” Id. Thus,
when a movant seeks vacation of a judgment based on a lack of service, the motion concerns
“whether the trial court had jurisdiction to render judgment,” and it is therefore “not
governed by Civ.R. 60(B).” J.M. v. J.C., 10th Dist. No. 19AP-739, 2020-Ohio-4963, ¶ 22.
See also, Shah v. Simpson, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-24, 2014-Ohio-675, ¶ 24. In that
circumstance, the movant need not present a meritorious defense or show that the motion
was timely filed. J.M. at ¶ 22, citing Gupta v. Edgecombe, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-807, 2004-
Ohio-3227, ¶ 12. “A court has inherent power to vacate a void judgment because such an
order simply recognizes the fact that the judgment was always a nullity.” Van DeRyt v. Van
DeRyt, 6 Ohio St.2d 31, 36 (1966). A void judgment may be challenged at any time. Howell
v. Howell, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-961, 2014-Ohio-2195, ¶ 8.
       {¶ 16} Instead of determining whether Elghadban was properly served and was
subject to its jurisdiction, the trial court denied Elghadban’s motion for relief from
judgment because it concluded that Elghadban did not meet the burden under Civ.R. 60(B)
of establishing that he filed his motion in a timely manner. But because Elghadban was
moving for relief on the basis that he was not served with process and that the trial court’s
judgment was void ab initio, the requirements under Civ.R. 60(B), including the timeliness
requirement, did not apply. Accordingly, the trial court’s application of those requirements
and denial of Elghadban’s motion for failure to satisfy the timeliness requirement was
erroneous.
No. 23AP-532                                                                                  6


       {¶ 17} Abouharga has conceded, both in her brief and during oral argument, that
the trial court should have decided Elghadban’s motion for relief from judgment as a
common-law motion to vacate judgment, not as a motion under Civ.R. 60(B), but she
nevertheless argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding Elghadban to
the inapposite requirements of Civ.R. 60(B) because it held a hearing on Elghadban’s
motion. That argument is misplaced. The Supreme Court of Ohio has clearly stated, “[t]his
should be axiomatic: a court does not have discretion to misapply the law.” Johnson v.
Abdullah, 166 Ohio St.3d 427, 2021-Ohio-3304, ¶ 38. “ ‘No court—not a trial court, not an
appellate court, nor even a supreme court—has the authority, within its discretion, to
commit an error of law.’ ” Id., quoting State v. Boles, 187 Ohio App.3d 345, 2010-Ohio-
278, ¶ 26 (3d Dist.). A trial court commits an error of law when it applies an incorrect legal
standard. See Glasco v. Ohio Dept. of Job & Family Servs., 10th Dist. No. 03AP-871, 2004-
Ohio-2168, ¶ 23; Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Easley, 10th Dist. No. 93AP-86, 
1993 Ohio App.LEXIS 6512 (Sept. 28, 1993).
       {¶ 18} Because the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard, denied
Elghadban’s motion for relief from judgment based on Elghadban’s noncompliance with
the inapplicable requirements of Civ.R. 60(B), and did not determine whether Elghadban
was properly served, we conclude that the trial court committed a legal error that requires
us to sustain appellant’s first assignment of error and reverse the trial court’s judgment.
       B. Second assignment of error
       {¶ 19} Elghadban’s second assignment of error states: “THE DENIAL OF
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE FOR LACK OF SERVICE IS AN ABUSE OF
DISCRETION.” Having already determined that we must reverse the trial court’s judgment
denying Elghadban’s motion to vacate and remand this matter to the trial court for it to
decide that motion under the appropriate legal framework, by determining whether
Elghadban was properly served, we conclude that Elghadban’s second assignment of error
is not ripe for review.
III. CONCLUSION
       {¶ 20} For these reasons, we sustain Elghadban’s first assignment of error, decline
to address Elghadban’s second assignment of error, reverse the trial court’s decision
denying Elghadban’s motion for relief from judgment, and remand this matter to the
No. 23AP-532                                                                   7

MEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND ORDER ON COMMONWEALTH'S MOTION TO RETURN SEIZED PROPERTY[1]
            The Commonwealth and the victim of the underlying fraudulent transfer, Louis Courtemanche (""Courtemanche""),jointly move for the return of$30,100.00 in cash seized pursuant to a search warrant from an Athena Bitcoin, Inc. (""Athena"") automated teller machine (""ATM'' or ""Athena ATM"") on March 26, 2024. Athena opposes the motion and requests that the Court order the funds be turned over to it, on the grounds that Athena is the rightful owner. For the reasons discussed below, the Commonwealth's and Courtemanche's Motion to Return Seized Property is DENIED, and the money seized is ordered to be turned over to Athena.
BACKGROUND
            On March 21, 2024, Courtemanche went to the Franklin police department and reported that he was the victim of a fraud. Courtemanche informed the police that, on March 20, 2024, an individual claiming to be from the Department of Homeland Security (""DHS"") contacted him and accused him of being involved in a money laundering scheme. He explained that the individual purportedly from DHS, informed him that DHS had ""seized packages"" with his name on them and threatened to arrest him if he did not prove his identity and comply with the

instructions he was about to given. This individual then instructed Courtemanche to: (1) remain on the phone the entire time; (2) proceed to his bank and withdraw a total of$30,000.00; (3) withdraw the funds in increments, not all at once; (4) provide the names and locations of bank(s) which he has account(s); (5) proceed to Smiley Gas Station located at 52 East Central Street, Franklin, Massachusetts, where there is a ""federal depository""; (6) purchase Bitcoin from an Athena A1M in certain increments, totaling $30,000.00. Courtemanche followed the instructions. He proceeded to his bank, withdrew $30,100.00 in small increments from his account, and then deposited $30,100.00 cash into an Athena A1M, located inside the Smiley Gas Station.[2]
            Upon initiating the transaction at the Athena ATM, Courtemanche was presented with Athena's terms of service, warning him: ""DO NOT use this A1M to 'PROTECT YOUR MONEY' from a supposed bank account compromise or under the direction of your bank, FBI, U.S. Marshals, Customs and Border Patrol, Social Security, police or local authorities!!"" It went on to state: ""DO NOT send Bitcoin to pay for 'fees' or 'taxes' to any government agency or for the receipt of a package!"" Additional warnings that were listed and in smaller print stated the following:
""Are you making a large purchase? Several thousand dollars? If you've been asked to insert a large amount STOP and think about what you are doing! Cash inserted into this machine will NOT be held under your name!
All Bitcoin and other purchases are final once you've begun to insert cash.
You accept fall responsibility for any transaction conducted through our ATM . . . By proceeding with the transaction, you understand that Athena Bitcoin Inc. 's sole
 
--------------------------------------------
 
[2] Unlike traditional ATMs---which allow users to withdraw cash, check balances, or deposit funds-a Bitcoin ATM operates independently of bank accounts. To utilize a Bitcoin ATM, such as the one at issue here, individuals insert cash or use a debit card to acquire Bitcoin, which remains entirely digital. Individuals who use these ATMs may sell their cryptocurrency via the ATM and receive cash in return.
 
                                                            -2-
 
responsibility is to deliver that bitcoin or other crypto asset to the address shown to you on the ATM screen.
Below the smaller print, the Athena ATM screen listed a number to call with any questions. Courtemanche agreed to aforementioned terms and proceeded with the transaction. During the transaction process, he was then prompted to input his government-issued photo identification (""ID""), as required by the Customer Identification Protocol for transactions that exceed a certain amount. Courtemanche inserted his government-issued ID into the scanner and entered the Bitcoin wallet address.[3] After he entered the Bitcoin wallet address, and while still displaying the wallet address, the Athena ATM screen listed the following four declarations, each accompanied by a checkbox:
l) I decare that the crypto address shown above was generated by myself in a wallet app or service account that I created for myself.
2) I declare that this address or QR code has NOT been given to me by a friend, family member, government or bank agent, employer, or any other third party.
3) I understand that the cash inserted into this kiosk will not be returned to me under any circumstances, including cases of fraud.
4) I understand that scam artists often trick victims into using Bitcoin ATM and that I can safely STOP here and call Athena Bitcoin at 312-690-4466 or the AARP Fraud Watch helpline at 877-908-3360 (Mon-Fri 7:00 am-11:00 pm) for advice about my situation before making any purchase.
Courtemanche checked each box, agreeing to the above declarations before proceeding.[4] Courtemanche then completed four separate transactions, sending money to the specified Bitcoin
 
--------------------------------------------
 
[3] A Bitcoin wallet address consists of a lengthy sequence of alphanumeric characters that designates the recipient location for cryptocurrency transactions. The Bitcoin wallet itself is a software program or digital application responsible for generating these wallet addresses. Courtemanche entered the following Bitcoin wallet address: bclq528q6s70xjuag3vfajmedjkml39wpglrjk5x52.
[4] At the bottom of the screen, Courtemanche was presented with two ""boxes."" To proceed, he had to ""tap"" one of them. The box located at the bottom left comer of the screen stated: ""I entered someone else's Bitcoin address because I want to send them Bitcoin."" And the box located at the bottom right comer of the screen stated: ""This is my personal Bitcoin wallet"" Courtemanche tapped the latter box. After confirming it was his personal Bitcoin wallet, he was then able to insert his cash into the Athena ATM.
 
                                                            -3-
 
wallet address. Immediately thereafter, the Bitcoin account balance in the wallet was emptied to zero. The individual who fraudulently induced Courtemanche could not be identified other than by a series of numbers and characters from the Bitcoin address and the two phone numbers that Courtemanche was instructed to call and text.
            On March 21, 2024, Athena's customer service team received a phone call reporting the fraud. On March 22, 2024, the Norfolk County District Attorney applied for a search warrant to seize the cash deposit from the Athena ATM, alleging that the funds were obtained through larceny by false pretenses and constituted evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation. The search warrant was issued on March 22, 2024. When the detectives went to retrieve the funds, the ATM technician was not available to facilitate recovery of the money from the ATM.
            On March 26, 2024, the Franklin police department executed Search Warrant No. 2482SW00010 and seized $30,100.00 in cash from the Athena ATM. The gas station owner, where the Athena ATM is located, informed Detective Leeanne Baker that Athena rents the space and is responsible for maintaining the ATM. The owner also stated that the most recent withdrawal from the Athena ATM took place three days before March 20th, with no transactions recorded on March 20th or 21st.
            Athena and Courtemanche are both claiming rights to the currency in the ATM.
DISCUSSION
            General Laws c. 276, § 3, provides that an officer who seizes property pursuant to a search warrant ""shall safely keep"" the property as long as necessary so it can be ""produced or used as evidence in any trial."" See Commonwealth v. Fleury, 489 Mass. 421,429 (2022). ""[A]s soon as may be, thereafter,"" the Commonwealth must return any property that had been stolen,
 
                                                            -4-
 
. embezzled, obtained by false pretenses, or otherwise obtained in the commission of a crime to its rightful owner. G. L. c. 276, § 3. See G. L. c. 276, § 1.
            Here, the Commonwealth has represented that the funds retrieved from the Athena ATM has been logged into evidence and photographs were taken, thus, it is not necessary to retain the funds for the ongoing investigation. See Commonwealth v. Sacco, 401 Mass. 204, 207 n.3 (1987). As a result, the Commonwealth is moving for the cash to be returned to its rightful owner, Courtemanche. G. L. c. 276, § 3. Athena alleges that it is the rightful owner of the seized funds, therefore, the funds should be returned to it.
            To determine ownership, the courts generally look to ""one's 'indicia of dominion and control such as possession, title, and financial stake."" Commonwealth v. Ten Thousand Twenty- Five Dollars in United States Currency, 2000 Mass. Super. LEXIS 456, at *7 (Mass. Super.), citing Commonwealth v. One 1986 Volkswagen GTJ Auto, 417 Mass. 369, 373 (1994). Where, as here, the property at issue is money, legal title ""passes with delivery to a person who acquires it in good faith and for valuable consideration."" United States v. $3,000 in Cash, 906 F. Supp. 1061, 1065 (E.D. Va 1995). As the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed, ""[e]ven when money is stolen, and is passed by the thief, it becomes the property of him to whom it is passed for a valuable consideration, and without knowledge that it was stolen."" Chapman v. Cole. 78 Mass. 141, 143 (1858), citing Miller v. Race, 1 Bur..452.
            Here, Athena received title to the funds Courtemanche deposited into its ATM because it acquired the money in good faith and without knowledge of the fraudulent activity. Athena gave valuable consideration by transferring the Bitcoin to the Bitcoin wallet in exchange for the cash deposited into its ATM, as ordered by Courtemanche. Once Courtemanche clicked to complete the transaction, he received a receipt with the date, transaction identification, Bitcoin address,
 
                                                            -5-
 
exchange rate, cash rendered, and the amount ofBitcoin purchased. Once this exchange had occurred, the Bitcoin was irretrievable by Athena. Therefore, because Athena delivered Bitcoin in the amount equivalent to the cash Courtemanche deposited, Athena is the rightful owner of the funds seized.
            Courtemanche argues that Athena had a heightened duty to protect against fraudulent transactions. As noted above, Athena did provide multiple warnings to Courtemanche who nonetheless, voluntarily checked off boxes confirming that: (1) the crypto address was his own, (2) the address was not given to him by a government or bank agent, (3) the cash would not be returned, including in cases of fraud; and (4) ifhe suspected a scam, he could contact Athena's number or the Fraud Watch helpline for advice before making the purchase.
            Courtemanche also alleges Athena violated Anti-Money Laundering (""AML"") rules by not holding or flagging transactions. AML regulations require suspicious activity be reported through Suspicious Activity Reports (""SARs"") for transactions of $2,000.00 or more. A SAR must be filed within 30 days of detection and kept confidential, however, it does not mandate holding suspicious transactions because its purpose is simply to notify authorities. Therefore, while some of Courtemanche's transactions exceeded $2,000.00, filing a SAR would not have stopped the transactions from proceeding.
            Finally, Courtemanche asserts that Athena's warnings about fraud on its website render it complicit in the alleged fraudulent activity. However, because Athena neither had knowledge of nor participated in the fraud, it is not considered liable. See Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC v.
Carlson (In re Prop. Seized for Forfeiture from Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC), 21 N.W.3d 157, 164 (Iowa 2025) (holding for Bitcoin Depot; general awareness of scams does not establish sufficient reason to know of duress).
 
                                                            -6-
 
            In conclusion, the Court finds that Athena is the rightful owner of the funds, and therefore the motion to return seized property to Courtemanche is denied.
ORDER
            For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that the Commonwealth's Motion to Return Seized Property is DENIED and that the $30,100.00 currently in the custody of the Franklin police department is to be transferred to Athena.

                On Appeal from the 14th Judicial District Court
                            Dallas County, Texas
                     Trial Court Cause No. DC-19-11006

                         MEMORANDUM OPINION
                     Before Justices Schenck, Smith, and Garcia
                              Opinion by Justice Smith
      SHS Holdings, LLC, appeals the trial court’s order dismissing its claims

against Todd Glenn Rowan and Linda Ann Butcher pursuant to a forum selection

clause in the underlying contract. In two issues, appellant argues the trial court erred

because the forum selection clause (1) was induced by appellees’ fraud and (2) was

unenforceable because the corporate party to the contract, Rewards Blockchain

Holdings, did not exist. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.

      Appellant is an investment company engaged in funding early-stage

companies. Appellees’ company, Blockchain, held interests in cryptocurrencies,
among other things. In February 2019, appellant entered into a contract, the Share

Purchase Agreement (SPA), to purchase five percent of Blockchain in exchange for

a payment of $200,000.         The contract identified Blockchain as “a company

incorporated under the laws of Bermuda” and listed a Bermuda address for

Blockchain’s registered office.     The contract also contained a provision that

established Bermuda as the forum for settling any dispute, controversy, or claim

arising out of the contract.

      The parties also were to enter simultaneously into a second agreement, the

“Agreement for Future Token Sale” (SAFT), which had the effect of guaranteeing

the return of appellant’s $200,000 investment. To accomplish this, the SAFT

granted appellant 2,000,000 cryptocurrency tokens which appellees guaranteed

could be sold for the full amount of appellant’s investment within 100 days. The

SAFT provided that it too was governed by Bermuda law.

      Appellant signed both agreements.        In reliance on representations that

appellees had also signed the agreements, appellant paid appellees $200,000.

However, after appellant made the payment, appellees “claimed they had not signed

the SAFT and would not honor the terms.”          Despite a written demand from

appellant‘s attorney, appellees refused to return the $200,000.

      In its first amended petition, the live pleading, appellant asserted appellees

committed fraud and violated the Texas Theft Liability Act. Appellant claimed the

SPA was void because appellees sold appellant “shares of a fictitious Bermuda

                                        –2–
company that did not exist at the time the agreement was made.” Specifically,

appellant argued appellees’ representation that Blockchain was “a company

incorporated under the laws of Bermuda” was false, and “no such company had ever

been formed and incorporated in Bermuda.”

      Appellees responded by filing motions to dismiss stating “each of the

purported contracts at issue” included a mandatory forum selection clause

designating Bermuda as the “exclusive jurisdiction and venue” for the resolution of

disputes between the parties.

      In its response to the motions to dismiss, appellant reasserted that Blockchain

was “a fictitious entity that did not exist as a corporate entity at the time [the]

agreement was signed, nor at any other time before or after.” Thus, appellant argued,

there was no valid written contract between appellant and appellees. Appellant

further argued that, even if a contract did exist, the forum selection clause requiring

disputes to be resolved in Bermuda would be void and unenforceable because the

contract was induced by fraud, “including fraudulent representations made about the

forum-selection clause.” As proof that Blockchain did not exist, appellant relied on

a letter under the “Government of Bermuda, Ministry of Finance, Registrar of

Companies” letterhead dated October 22, 2019. The letter stated that, “[I]n response

to your query dated October 21, 2019, we can confirm that Rewards Blockchain

Holdings is not a company that appears on our register.”



                                         –3–
      At the conclusion of a hearing in December 2019, the trial court agreed with

appellees that a tribunal was going to have to resolve the issues in the case, and “the

parties by the intent of their writing determined that that was going to be done by an

arbitration panel in Bermuda.” On December 5, 2019, the trial court signed an order

granting appellees’ motion to dismiss and dismissing all of appellant’s claims with

prejudice. This appeal followed.

      In two issues, appellant argues the trial court erred in its dismissal because the

evidence established that no contract could be formed between the parties because

Blockchain did not exist, and the forum selection and arbitration clause were induced

by fraud.

      “A motion to dismiss is the proper procedural mechanism for enforcing a

forum-selection clause that a party to the agreement has violated in filing suit.”

Chandler Mgmt. Corp. v. First Specialty Ins. Corp., Vericlaim, Inc., 

452 S.W.3d887, 891 (Tex. App. —Dallas 2014) (quoting Phoenix Network Techs. (Europe) Ltd.

v. Neon Sys., Inc., 177 S.W.3d 605, 610 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no

pet.). We review the trial court’s decision whether to enforce a forum-selection

clause for an abuse of discretion, deferring to the trial court’s factual determinations

if they are supported by the evidence, but we review the trial court’s legal

determinations de novo. In re Int’l Profit Assocs., Inc., 274 S.W.3d 672, 675 (Tex.

2009). A party attempting to show that such a clause should not be enforced bears

a heavy burden. In re Lyon Fin. Servs., Inc., 257 S.W.3d 228, 232 (Tex. 2008) (per

                                          –4–
curiam) (orig. proceeding). “Forum-selection clauses are generally enforceable and

presumptively valid.” In re Cornerstone Healthcare Holding Grp., Inc., 

348 S.W.3d538, 540 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, orig. proceeding). Arbitration and forum-

selection clauses should be enforced, even if they are part of an agreement alleged

to have been fraudulently induced, as long as the specific clauses were not

themselves the product of fraud or coercion. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 

148S.W.3d 124, 134 (Tex. 2004). As the trial judge did not make findings of fact or

conclusions of law, we infer that the trial court made all fact findings that have

support in the record and are necessary to uphold the ruling. Moki Mac River

Expeditions v. Drugg, 221 S.W.3d 569, 574 (Tex. 2007).

      Among the “General Representations and Warranties of the Seller” in the SPA

was the following provision:

      7.6 Proper and valid organization. The Company is an exempted
      Company that is duly organized and validly existing under the
      applicable laws of Bermuda and was properly constituted. It has its
      actual centre of administration at its registered office; it has all requisite
      corporate power and authority under applicable laws to carry on the
      business presently conducted by it. The Company has at all times acted
      in all material respects in accordance with its respective articles of
      association. All facts relating to the Company to be registered under
      Bermudian law are accurately registered.

Thus, the contract signed by the parties is at least some evidence that Blockchain

“validly exist[ed]” under Bermuda law at the time it was executed in February 2019.

      To counter this evidence, appellant attached to its response to appellees’

motion to dismiss a letter under the letterhead of the “Government of Bermuda,

                                          –5–
Ministry of Finance, Registrar of Companies” dated October 22, 2019. The letter

stated that, “[I]n response to your query dated October 21, 2019, we can confirm

that Rewards Blockchain Holdings is not a company that appears on our register.”

We infer the trial court found that, even assuming the letter was the official

document it purported to be, the letter was no evidence of whether “Rewards

Blockchain Holdings” was ever required to appear on the “register” mentioned in

the letter or whether “Rewards Blockchain Holdings” did appear on the “register”

on a date prior to October 22, 2019. See Moki Mac, 221 S.W.3d at 574. Based on

this record, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting

appellant’s argument that Blockchain did not exist. See In re Int’l Profit Assocs.,

274 S.W.3d at 675; Moki Mac, 221 S.W.3d at 574.

      In a related argument, appellant asserts that the underlying contract as a whole

was the result of fraud because appellees induced appellant to pay $200,000 for

shares of a company that did not exist. We have already concluded the evidence is

insufficient to support appellant’s position on this issue, and we need not address it

further.

      Appellant further stresses that the forum-selection clauses were themselves

the product of fraud in that Rowan falsely represented that Bermuda laws concerning

cryptocurrency were clear, and Bermuda was therefore a favorable forum for

resolving cryptocurrency disputes. In support of this position, appellant relies on the

affidavit of its managing member, Edward Sigmond, which states in part:

                                         –6–
      7. Although I was concerned about the forum for disputes being
      designated as Bermuda, I relied on her explanation that entity “Rewards
      Blockchain Holdings” was a current, existing corporation, incorporated
      in Bermuda with an existing office location and address as well as her
      explanation that Bermuda law regarding crypto-currencies and
      Bermuda as the most favorable venue for any legal disputes or actions
      was essential for conducting business in the crypto-currency industry.
      This representation is untrue. Attached is a certification from the
      Bermuda Registrar of Companies responding to a request from my
      attorney. Exhibit No. “A”.

      8. Had I known that these representations were false, and particularly
      that no such corporation had been formed or existed in Bermuda, SHS
      would not have agreed to sign any agreement with Rowan and/or
      Butcher that contained a mandatory arbitration in Bermuda before a
      panel of three arbitrators; in fact, we would have signed no agreement
      at all and certainly would not have paid them $200,000.

In making its argument, appellant asserts it would not have agreed to the selection

of Bermuda as the appropriate forum to resolve disputes had Butcher not falsely

represented that (1) Blockchain already existed as a Bermuda corporation and (2)

there were compelling legal and practical reasons for making Bermuda the chosen

forum in which to resolve disputes.

      Clearly, appellant attempted to make the necessary showing that the specific

forum-selection clauses at issue were themselves the product of fraud or coercion.

See In re Prudential, 148 S.W.3d at 134. However, appellant presented no evidence

concerning the actual nature of Bermuda law relating to cryptocurrencies.

Sigmond’s affidavit stated “these representations were false” without providing any

basis for his statement. In the absence of findings of fact or conclusions of law, we

infer that the trial court made all fact findings that have support in the record and are

                                          –7–
necessary to uphold the ruling. Moki Mac, 221 S.W.3d at 574. Accordingly, we

conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting appellant’s argument

that the forum selection and arbitration clauses were themselves induced by fraud.

See In re Int’l Profit Assocs., 274 S.W.3d at 675; In re Prudential, 

148 S.W.3d at134.

       Therefore, we conclude the trial court did not err in granting appellees’

motions to dismiss. See Chandler Mgmt., 452 S.W.3d at 891.               We overrule

appellant’s first and second issues.

       We affirm the trial court’s judgment.

      ORDER RESOLVING MOTION TO STAY PENDING APPEAL

WHEREAS:

      A.     On November 19, 2024, plaintiffs Zachary Bruch and Joshua Kaufman

(“Plaintiffs”)1 initiated this action through the filing of a Verified Complaint

Pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 to Compel Inspection of Books and Records (the

“Complaint”). See Dkt. 1. The Complaint seeks an order compelling defendant

Switchboard Technology Labs, Inc. (“Switchboard”) to produce certain books and

records identified in a November 1, 2024 demand (the “Demand”).

      B.     Switchboard is a software development company that builds blockchain

oracle software. Mar. 25, 2025 Tr. Telephonic Rulings of Ct. [hereinafter BR] 5,




1
 On December 18, 2024, the Court entered a Stipulation and Order Regarding Substitution
of Plaintiff Joshua Kaufman, substituting Kaufman for Joshua SB, LLC, the entity through
which Kaufman holds Switchboard stock. Dkt. 25.
Dkt. 92.   Switchboard was founded by Plaintiffs and non-parties Christopher

Hermida, Mitchell Gildenberg, and Jackson Jessup. Id.

      C.     In 2022, Switchboard began a process to issue cryptocurrency “tokens,”

which are digital assets created on a blockchain that represent assets or rights in a

blockchain ecosystem. Id. at 6. But Switchboard’s founders disagreed on a plan to

allocate the tokens to be issued. Id. at 10. After Plaintiffs rejected two of Hermida’s

allocation proposals as “arbitrary and lack[ing] a consistent methodology,” Hermida,

Gildenberg, and Jessup exercised their majority voting power to execute stockholder

written consents appointing non-party Mark Mugglestone to Switchboard’s board of

directors, with the intention that Mugglestone temporarily serve as the company’s

Chief Executive Officer, and tasked him with preparing a proposal to allocate the

tokens. Id. at 10, 12–13. As directed, Mugglestone prepared a proposal, which he

and one other director then approved (the “Token Allocation”). Id. at 13–14.

Plaintiffs contend that the final Token Allocation was designed to unfairly enrich

Hermida, Gildenberg, and Jessup at the expense of other stockholders. Id. at 16.

      D.     Through the Demand, Plaintiffs seek books and records to value their

interests in Switchboard, investigate Mugglestone’s disinterestedness and

independence, and investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with

(1) Switchboard’s entry into an asset assignment agreement and a loan agreement in

furtherance of the token issuance, and (2) the Token Allocation.

                                          2
      E.     On February 21, 2025, the Court held a one-day trial.            At trial,

Switchboard argued that Plaintiffs lacked a proper purpose for making the Demand,

including because Plaintiffs lacked a credible basis to investigate possible

wrongdoing, and that Plaintiffs’ stated purposes are not their true purposes for

seeking books and records.

      F.     On March 10, the Court issued a forty-page post-trial oral ruling (the

“Bench Ruling”). The Bench Ruling concluded that:

                   a.     Plaintiffs stated facially proper purposes to value their

Switchboard shares and to investigate Mugglestone’s disinterestedness and

independence. BR at 20.

                   b.     Plaintiffs failed to establish a proper purpose to investigate

possible wrongdoing in connection with Switchboard’s entry into the asset

assignment agreement and the loan agreement. Id. at 22–24.

                   c.     Plaintiffs established a proper purpose to investigate

wrongdoing in connection with the Token Allocation by presenting sufficient

evidence suggesting a credible basis from which the Court could infer that

wrongdoing may have occurred. Id. at 27. On this issue, the Bench Ruling

explained:

             [P]laintiffs seek to investigate possible wrongdoing in
      connection with the token allocation. Switchboard contends that
      [P]laintiffs have not established a credible basis for investigation
      because the token allocation was approved by independent directors.
                                          3
      At the time of the allocation, the board comprised Jessup, Mugglestone,
      and Madfes. Jessup received tokens and therefore did not vote on the
      allocation.

             According to Switchboard, Mugglestone and Madfes were both
      independent with respect to the allocation because they did not receive
      tokens. The evidence at trial provides a credible basis to suspect that
      Hermida, Gildenberg, and Jessup, acting together by stockholder
      consent, exercised a majority of the company’s voting power to appoint
      Mugglestone as a director and CEO, and tasked him with developing a
      token allocation proposal. Hermida, Gildenberg, and Jessup then
      participated in Mugglestone’s process, which resulted in Mugglestone
      recommending an allocation that granted Hermida, Gildenberg, and
      Jessup valuable corporate assets in the form of tokens. And as
      Mugglestone undertook that process, the same stockholders who
      appointed him retained the ability to exercise a majority of the
      company’s voting power to remove him from the board and terminate
      him as CEO if they did not support his allocation proposal. Those facts
      satisfy [P]laintiffs’ low burden to demonstrate a credible basis to
      investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the token
      allocation.

            ....

            In an effort to demonstrate a lack of wrongdoing, Switchboard
      argues that similar tiers of allocations for leadership, employees and
      advisors are commonplace in the crypto industry. Switchboard’s
      arguments may well win the day in plenary litigation, but, as Delaware
      Supreme Court precedent makes clear, “a Section 220 proceeding ‘is
      not the time for a merits assessment of Plaintiffs’ potential claims
      against [the corporation’s] fiduciaries.” . . . At this stage, I instead
      must assess whether [P]laintiffs have come forward with some facts
      supporting a credible basis to infer possible wrongdoing, and for the
      reasons I just explained, [P]laintiffs have satisfied that low bar with
      respect to the token allocation.

Id. at 26–27 (quoting AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Lebanon Cty. Empls.’ Ret. Fund,

243 A.3d 417, 437 (Del. 2020)).

                                         4
                    d.     Switchboard did not “satisf[y] its burden to prove, by a

preponderance of the evidence, that [P]laintiffs’ stated purposes are not their true

purposes for seeking books and records.” Id. at 30; see also id. at 27–30.

                    e.     Plaintiffs were entitled to inspect some, but not all, of the

books and records sought in the Demand. 2 Id. at 33–38.

      G.     On March 25, the Court entered a Post-Trial Order and Judgment (the

“Judgment”). Dkt. 94. Under the Judgment, Switchboard must produce books and

records within ten business days of entry of the Judgment. See Dkt. 94 ¶ 1; id. cmts.

(modifying paragraph 1 to require production within ten business days). 3

      H.     On March 26, Switchboard filed a Motion to Stay Pending Appeal (the

“Motion to Stay”). Def.’s Mot. to Stay Pending Appeal [hereinafter Mot.], Dkt. 95.




2
  The Bench Ruling directed Switchboard to produce financial statements, materials
concerning Mugglestone’s appointment, and formal board materials concerning the Token
Allocation, to the extent such documents had not already been produced. BR at 33–35.
The Bench Ruling denied Plaintiffs’ requests for informal director- and officer-level
materials, explaining that, “[a]lthough the company has not produced board meeting
minutes, it has produced detailed board resolutions formally evidencing the directors’
decisions, which, under the circumstances, are effectively the equivalent of board meeting
minutes. Those resolutions, along with the other formal materials provided to the board
(including the Token Allocation Assessment Framework memo), generally are sufficient
to identify ‘the who, what, where, when, and why of the possible wrongdoing.’” Id. at 36–
37.
3
 On April 7, the Court issued a minute order directing that “[d]eadlines under the Post-
Trial Order and Judgment (Dkt. 94) will be held in abeyance until the Court has ruled on
Defendant’s Motion to Stay Pending Appeal (Dkt. 95).” Dkt. 100.
                                            5
In the Motion to Stay, Switchboard represents that it “intends to promptly appeal the

[Final] Order.”4 Id. ¶ 4.

       I.     Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the Motion to Stay on April 1, 2025,

       NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, this 9th day of April

2025, as follows:

       1.     Under Court of Chancery Rule 62(d), “[s]tays pending appeal and stay

and cost bonds shall be governed by article IV, § 24 of the Constitution of the State

of Delaware and by the Rules of the Supreme Court.” Ct. Ch. R. 62(d). “[A] motion

for stay must be filed in the trial court in the first instance. . . . A stay or an injunction

pending appeal may be granted or denied in the discretion of the trial court, whose

decision shall be reviewable by [the Delaware Supreme] Court.” Supr. Ct. R. 32(a).

       2.     In assessing whether to grant a stay, the Court must (1) “make a

preliminary assessment of likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal;”


4
  Although Plaintiffs argue that the Motion to Stay is not ripe because Switchboard has not
yet filed its appeal, Opp’n ¶ 2, this Court has, on prior occasions, decided motions to stay
pending a forthcoming appeal. See, e.g., Inter-Local Pension Fund GCC/IBT v. Calgon
Carbon Corp., 2019 WL 1280753, at *1–2 (Del. Ch. Mar. 20, 2019) (“[T]his action is
stayed pending the outcome of Calgon’s forthcoming appeal . . . .”).
                                              6
(2) “assess whether the petitioner will suffer irreparable injury if the stay is not

granted;” (3) “assess whether any other interested party will suffer substantial harm

if the stay is granted;” and (4) “determine whether the public interest will be harmed

if the stay is granted.” Kirpat, Inc. v. Del. Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm’n, 

741A.2d 356, 357 (Del. 1998) (citing Evans v. Buchanan, 435 F. Supp. 832, 841–42 (D.

Del. 1977)).

      3.       The first Kirpat factor “cannot be interpreted literally or in a vacuum.”

Grand Acq., LLC v. Passco Indian Springs DST, 2016 WL 6199007, at *1 (Del. Ch.

Oct. 21, 2016) (quoting Kirpat, 741 A.2d at 358). Doing so “‘would lead most

probably to consistent denials of stay motions, despite the immediate threat of

substantial irreparable injury to the movant,’ because the trial court would be

required first to confess error in its ruling before it could issue a stay.” Kirpat, 

741A.2d at 357 (quoting Evans, 435 F. Supp. at 843). “If the other three factors strongly

favor interim relief, then a court may exercise its discretion to reach an equitable

resolution by granting a stay if the petitioner has presented a serious legal question

that raises a ‘fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberative investigation.’”

Id. at 358 (quoting Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 

559F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).

      4.       Switchboard has not, in my view, presented a serious legal question that

raises a fair ground for litigation.       Switchboard suggests that its arguments

                                            7
concerning token issuances in the crypto industry present “matters of first

impression,”5 and that at trial, Switchboard “presented evidence that the token

allocation challenged by Plaintiffs was commonplace in the crypto industry and that

the allocation was approved by an undisputedly independent director, whereas

Plaintiffs’ evidence was largely limited to allegations that the Company’s CEO was

appointed by stockholders other than Plaintiffs and could have been removed by the

Company’s Board.” Mot. ¶ 7. In truth, this case does not present any novel legal

issues, nor does the Bench Ruling make broad (or any) pronouncements about

compensation decisions approved by independent directors, as Switchboard

contends.6 Id. The merits factor does not favor a stay.




5
 Mot. ¶ 8. Switchboard does not explain what legal issues it believes raise matters of first
impression.
6
  Switchboard claims that “[t]he Court ruled that a credible basis exists if stockholders who
elected the director making compensation decisions (i) provide information relating to his
decision, (ii) receive compensation as a result of his decision, and (iii) retain the ability to
remove him from the Board—notwithstanding that all available evidence confirmed the
compensation awarded to those stockholders was within industry norms.” Reply ¶ 7. In
fact, the Bench Ruling narrowly concluded that, based on the evidentiary record developed
at trial, Plaintiffs met their burden to demonstrate a credible basis to investigate the Token
Allocation where three stockholders holding a majority of the company’s voting power
acted together to appoint a director with the singular purpose of naming him CEO and
tasking him with developing a proposal on the Token Allocation; those stockholders then
participated in the new CEO’s process to develop that proposal; and the resulting Token
Allocation awarded those three stockholders a disproportionate share of the issued tokens.
Switchboard also states that it “intends to appeal the Court’s ruling that Plaintiffs’ actual
purpose was not improper,” Reply ¶ 7, but the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ stated purposes is a
factual determination unlikely to be overturned on appeal.
                                               8
      5.     Under the second Kirpat factor, “[a] production under Section 220

pending an appeal of that production may constitute irreparable harm . . . .” Inter-

Local Pension Fund, 2019 WL 1280753, at *2. Switchboard argues that it will suffer

irreparable harm in the absence of a stay here because (1) “if the documents at issue

are produced and the Supreme Court then reverses the Order, the Company will be

left with no effective remedy for this harm and will have unnecessarily incurred

expense in carrying out the production order,” and (2) a production of books and

records would moot its appeal. Mot. ¶¶ 9–12. Although Switchboard has identified

some potential irreparable injury, “by this logic, courts would have to grant stays

pending appeal in every case involving the production of books and records[,]” yet

that “is not the law in Delaware.” In re UnitedHealth Gp. Inc., 2018 WL 2110958,

at *2 (Del. Ch. Apr. 27, 2018). As a result, the second Kirpat factor “weighs in favor

of granting the stay, but I am not convinced that it alone weighs ‘strongly’ enough

to warrant a stay.” Id.

      6.     Under the third factor, “[o]rdinarily, a Section 220 petitioner would not

face a threat of substantial harm from a stay pending appeal.” Amalgamated Bank

v. Yahoo! Inc., 2016 WL 866693, at *2 (Del. Ch. Mar. 4, 2016). Plaintiffs argue that

further delay of this summary proceeding will cause irreparable harm, but that

“reasoning would require denial of a stay in any summary or expedited proceeding.”




                                          9
In re UnitedHealth Gp. Inc., 2018 WL 2110958, at *2. “At best, this factor weighs

slightly in favor of denying the stay.” Id.

       7.     Under the fourth factor, “[n]either litigant provides convincing

arguments that the public interest will be harmed if the stay is granted or denied.”

Id. at *3. Although Plaintiffs assert that Switchboard’s “aggressive and dilatory

tactics” militate against a stay,7 I find this factor is neutral.

       8.     Weighing all four factors, even assuming Switchboard’s forthcoming

appeal will present a serious legal question that raises a fair ground for litigation, the

other factors do not weigh “strongly” in favor of granting a stay. “It is possible,

however, that the Delaware Supreme Court disagrees.” In re UnitedHealth Gp. Inc.,

2018 WL 2110958, at *1. “Recognizing that the Delaware Supreme Court may

balance the factors differently, this Court has taken the precaution of granting a

conditional stay pending appeal that preserves the status quo to enable the appellant

to seek a longer stay from the Delaware Supreme Court.” Id. (first citing Ward v.

Schmalhofer, 2017 WL 87478, at *3 (Del. Ch. Jan. 9, 2017) (ORDER); and then

citing Jagodzinski v. Silicon Valley Innovation Co., LLC, 2011 WL 4823569, at *4

(Del. Ch. Aug. 16, 2011)).




7
 Opp’n ¶ 31; see id. ¶ 32 (“[R]ewarding Defendant’s tactics with additional delay would
embolden similar tactics by Section 220 defendants and undermine the very purpose of
Section 220 and public policy.”).
                                            10
       9.      That approach is appropriate here. The effect of the Judgment will be

stayed through the tenth day after Switchboard files its appeal. If Switchboard fails

to move for a stay before the Delaware Supreme Court within that period, the stay

will lift. If Switchboard does file a motion to stay before the Delaware Supreme

Court, then this stay will remain in effect until the Delaware Supreme Court has

ruled on it.

       10.     Finally, Plaintiffs argue that if a stay is entered, the Court should enjoin

Switchboard “from distributing the tokens or otherwise taking any action to alter the

status quo with respect to the token issuance or allocation pending appeal and order

[Switchboard] to post security in the amount of $1,000,000.” Opp’n ¶ 35. Plaintiffs’

opposition to the Motion to Stay is not an appropriate vehicle to seek an injunction,

and a nominal bond of $1,000 is “reasonable in this books and records case.” Grand

Acq., 2016 WL 6199007, at *2. Switchboard shall post a bond in the amount of

$1,000 within ten days of the entry of this Order.

New York State Public Service Commission et al., Respondents.

Earthjustice, New York City (Hillary Aidun of counsel), for appellants.

McShan, J.
Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Richard M. Platkin, J.), entered March 20, 2023 in Albany County, which, among other things, in a combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 and action for declaratory judgment, granted a motion by respondent Public Service Commission to dismiss the petition/complaint against it.
In early 2021, respondent Digihost International, Inc. proposed a transaction to acquire the entire interest in respondent Fortistar North Tonawanda, LLC from respondent North Tonawanda Holdings, LLC (hereinafter collectively referred to as the crypto respondents), including ownership in a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility located in the City of North Tonawanda, Niagara County. Digihost anticipated utilizing the power generated from this facility to operate a cryptocurrency mining operation at a facility it intended on constructing adjacent to the cogeneration facility. In April 2021, Fortistar and Digihost petitioned respondent Public Service Commission (hereinafter the PSC), seeking a declaratory ruling that the proposed transaction did not require further review under Public Service Law §§ 70 and 83 or, alternatively, that the PSC approve the transaction by finding it in the public interest under those statutes. In response, petitioner Sierra Club along with Earthjustice filed a joint comment and petitioner Clean Air Coalition of Western New York, Inc. (hereinafter CACWNY) filed a comment, which both criticized the environmental impacts of allowing Digihost to use the facility for the mining of cryptocurrency and, in relevant part, asserted that the transaction undermined the emission reduction objectives of the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (L 2019, ch 106 [hereinafter CLCPA]). In September 2022, the PSC granted Digihost and Fortistar's petition, finding, in sum and substance, that the proposed transaction did not require further PSC review (hereinafter the declaratory ruling). Relevant here, the PSC also determined that the environmental concerns raised by petitioners and others were outside of the limited scope of the proceeding.
In October 2022, petitioners requested a rehearing pursuant to Public Service Law § 22 and 16 NYCRR 3.7. While the rehearing request was pending, petitioners commenced the instant combined action and proceeding challenging the declaratory ruling on the basis that the PSC unlawfully ignored the requirement of sections 7 (2) and (3) of the CLCPA to consider the impact on the environment and disadvantaged communities when it reviewed the proposed transaction. Petitioners further sought a preliminary injunction from Supreme Court enjoining the transaction pending further disposition. The PSC, as well as the crypto respondents, separately moved pre-answer to dismiss the petition/complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (2). In its motion, the PSC asserted that the declaratory ruling was not ripe for review and that petitioners lacked standing as they did not identify [*2]an injury-in-fact. In the crypto respondents' collective motion to dismiss, they asserted that petitioners' claim is moot due to the closing of the transaction and that petitioners lack standing to challenge the declaratory ruling. Petitioners opposed, and Supreme Court ultimately granted the PSC's motion to dismiss, finding that the declaratory ruling was not ripe for review because of the pending application for a rehearing.[FN1] Petitioners appeal.
We turn first to the parties' arguments pertaining to whether this matter was ripe at the time that Supreme Court considered the petition, and whether it has since been rendered moot by a determination on petitioners' request for a rehearing. To this end, during the pendency of this appeal, the PSC issued a June 2023 written decision denying petitioners' application for a rehearing.[FN2] However, despite having previously requested that the PSC rehear the petition for a declaratory ruling, petitioners now contend that such rehearing was foreclosed by the plain language of State Administrative Procedure Act § 204. We agree.
""A declaratory ruling shall be binding upon the agency unless it is altered or set aside by a court"" by virtue of a CPLR article 78 proceeding (State Administrative Procedure Act § 204 [1]). Particularly relevant here, State Administrative Procedure Act § 204 (1) does not permit an agency to ""retroactively change a valid declaratory ruling,"" only allowing such changes to apply ""prospectively."" Thus, the explicit language of State Administrative Procedure Act § 204 did not allow the PSC to modify its initial ruling with respect to its immediate applicability to petitioners and the crypto respondents regardless of its determination on ""reconsideration."" To this point, we note that petitioners initially requested that the PSC reconsider its declaratory ruling pursuant to Public Service Law § 22, which provides that following the issuance of an ""order"" by the PSC, ""any corporation or person interested therein shall have the right to apply for a rehearing in respect to any matter determined therein."" However, as petitioners have accurately noted on appeal, the right to request a rehearing of an order provided for in Public Service Law § 22 does not apply to declaratory rulings, a position that the PSC has also taken on numerous occasions in other proceedings (see e.g. Petition of National Grid Generation LLC for a Declaratory Ruling, NY PSC Case No. 17-M-0422, 2018 WL 509986 [Jan. 18, 2018]; Joint Petition of First Wind Holdings, LLC, et al., for a Declaratory Ruling, NY PSC Case No. 14-E-0509, 2015 WL 2447254 [May 18, 2015]). Although the PSC contends that the contrary position taken in this proceeding merely reflects a change in its own policy on which this Court may not intrude, that contention is belied by the plain language of the PSC's own regulations, which specifically provide that ""[a] declaratory ruling shall be identified as such, shall be binding on [the PSC], and shall not be retroactively [*3]changed"" (16 NYCRR 8.3), a limitation that is consistent with the general language in State Administrative Procedure Act § 204. In sum, the September 2022 declaratory ruling issued by the PSC is quasi-judicial in nature and, at the moment it was issued, was ""accorded the [same] conclusiveness that attaches to judicial judgments,"" thus rendering it ripe for review (Allied Chem. v Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 129 AD2d 233, 236 [4th Dept 1987] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], affd 72 NY2d 271 [1988], cert denied 488 US 1005 [1989]; see 16 NYCRR 8.1; see also Matter of Daily Star v Board of Trustees of Vil. of Cooperstown, 164 AD2d 531, 532 [3d Dept 1991]). The PSC could have theoretically rendered the matter moot by granting the relief sought by petitioners in their comment to the original request for a declaratory ruling; however, PSC's discretionary determination to reconsider the September 2022 ruling, and ultimately adhere to its original determination, did not have that effect (see Matter of MCI Telecom. Corp. v Public Serv. Commn. of State of N.Y., 231 AD2d 284, 290 [3d Dept 1997]; Matter of Gross v State of N.Y. Pub. Serv. Commn., 195 AD2d 866, 867 [3d Dept 1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 660 [1993]; Matter of Bonar v Shaffer, 140 AD2d 153, 155 [1st Dept 1988], lv denied 73 NY2d 702 [1988]; compare Chase v Board of Educ. of Roxbury Cent. School Dist., 188 AD2d 192, 197 [3d Dept 1993]).[FN3]
As to the crypto respondents' assertion that the appeal is moot because the challenged transaction has been completed, we disagree with that contention based upon the specific facts of this case. ""The jurisdiction of a court extends only to live controversies, and where changed circumstances prevent the court from rendering a decision which would effectually determine an actual controversy between the parties involved, the court will dismiss the appeal"" (Matter of Kopald v New York Pub. Serv. Commn., 204 AD3d 1108, 1109 [3d Dept 2022], lv denied 39 NY3d 957 [2022] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted]). The crypto respondents contend that the completion of the transaction and the degree of construction and improvement to the facilities that Digihost and Fortistar have undertaken since the declaratory ruling was issued cannot be unwound without great cost. The substantial completion of a project may indeed render a case moot ""when the progress of the work constitutes a change in circumstances that would prevent the court from rendering a decision that would effectively determine an actual controversy"" (Matter of Sierra Club v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, 169 AD3d 1485, 1486 [4th Dept 2019] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see Matter of ENP Assoc., LP v City of Ithaca Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 217 AD3d 1285, 1287 [3d Dept 2023], lv denied 40 NY3d 910 [2024]). Respondents correctly note that the failure to seek injunctive relief and maintain the status quo at each stage of litigation would, as a general premise[*4], render this case moot (see Matter of Dreikausen v Zoning Bd. of Appeals of City of Long Beach, 98 NY2d 165, 173 [2002]; Matter of Bothar Constr., LLC v Dominguez, 201 AD3d 1231, 1232-1233 [3d Dept 2022]; Matter of Sierra Club v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, 169 AD3d at 1486). However, a close inspection of the specific relief sought by petitioners in their comments to the original petition for a declaratory ruling suggests the availability of potential relief short of completely unwinding the transaction. To this end, petitioners seek to reverse the declaratory ruling and have the PSC engage in an analysis pursuant to CLCPA § 7 (2), which expressly provides that ""[i]n considering and issuing permits, licenses, and other administrative approvals and decisions, . . . all state agencies . . . shall consider whether such decisions are inconsistent with or will interfere with the attainment of the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits established in [ECL] article 75."" Importantly, that provision further provides that if an inconsistency is found, the agency ""shall provide a detailed statement of justification as to why such limits/criteria may not be met . . . and identify alternatives or greenhouse gas mitigation measures to be required where such project is located"" (CLCPA § 7 [2]). Further consideration by an agency in assessing whether to grant administrative approvals and/or issue decisions ""shall not disproportionately burden disadvantaged communities"" as defined in the relevant section of the Environmental Conservation Law (CLCPA § 7 [3]). While we need not express a definitive position as to whether the unwinding of the transaction is feasible at this juncture, other relief is available, such as the environmental mitigation expressly contemplated in the CLCPA (see Matter of Piagentini v New York State Bd. of Parole, 176 AD3d 138, 140 n 2 [3d Dept 2019], lv denied 35 NY3d 906 [2020]; U.S. Bank N.A. v Martinez, 162 AD3d 528, 528 [1st Dept 2018]; compare Matter of Pillmeier Produce Farms v Commissioner of Agric. & Mkts., 38 AD3d 1092, 1093 [3d Dept 2007]; Matter of Save the Pine Bush v Cuomo, 200 AD2d 859, 860 [3d Dept 1994], lv dismissed 83 NY2d 884 [1994]).[FN4] Under these circumstances, we do not believe the controversy is rendered moot.
Finally, as an alternative ground for affirmance, the crypto respondents argue that petitioners lack standing to challenge the declaratory ruling because they failed to demonstrate an injury-in-fact stemming directly from such ruling. We disagree. ""To establish standing to challenge respondent's governmental action, . . . [petitioners must] demonstrate both that [they] might suffer an injury in fact — i.e., actual harm by the action challenged that differs from that suffered by the public at large — and that such injury falls within the zone of interests"" of the legislation or statute through which the government acted (Matter of Saratoga Lake Protection & Improvement Dist. v Department of Pub[*5]. Works of City of Saratoga Springs, 46 AD3d 979, 981 [3d Dept 2007] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted], lv denied 10 NY3d 706 [2008]; see Matter of Schwartz v Morgenthau, 7 NY3d 427, 432 [2006]; Matter of Jorling v Adirondack Park Agency, 214 AD3d 98, 102 [3d Dept 2023]; Made From Scratch v City of New York, 200 AD2d 439, 439 [1st Dept 1994], lv denied 83 NY2d 755 [1994]). Here, petitioners seek to have the PSC engage in an additional review process pursuant to the CLCPA in connection with Digihost and Fortistar's petition seeking the written consent of the PSC to complete its purchase of the facility in question (see Public Service Law §§ 70, 83). In doing so, petitioners rely on the impact of the transaction on the disadvantaged communities of which their members are a part as well as the proximity of several of its members to the facility, noting the potential increase in emissions. As with other analogous proceedings that are premised upon environmental harm, petitioners must allege something more than generalized concerns (see Matter of Save Our Main St. Bldgs. v Greene County Legislature, 293 AD2d 907, 908 [3d Dept 2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 609 [2002]; compare Matter of Soule v Town of Colonie, 95 AD2d 979, 979-980 [3d Dept 1983]). Moreover, proximity alone is generally insufficient to raise an environmental challenge (see Matter of Creda, LLC v City of Kingston Planning Bd., 212 AD3d 1043, 1046 [3d Dept 2023]). Nevertheless, as articulated in the petition, by virtue of petitioners' members' proximity to the facilities, the proposed increase in use of those facilities will affect them differently than other members of the public, thus conferring standing under the specific facts of this case (see Matter of Save the Pine Bush, Inc. v Common Council of City of Albany, 13 NY3d 297, 305-306 [2009]; Society of Plastics Indus. v County of Suffolk, 77 NY2d 761, 779 [1991]; Matter of Town of Coeymans v City of Albany, 284 AD2d 830, 833-834 [3d Dept 2001], lvs denied 97 NY2d 602 [2001], 97 NY2d 602 [2001]; compare Matter of Clean Water Advocates of N.Y., Inc. v New York State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, 103 AD3d 1006, 1008 [3d Dept 2013], lv denied 21 NY3d 862 [2013]). Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of the petition and remit for further proceedings. The parties' remaining arguments, to the extent not addressed, have been considered and found unavailing.
Garry, P.J., Egan Jr., Aarons and Reynolds Fitzgerald, JJ., concur.
ORDERED that the judgment is reversed, on the law, without costs, respondent Public Service Commission's motion denied, and matter remitted to the Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's decision.
Footnotes

Footnote 1: Supreme Court denied petitioners' request for an injunction. Petitioners did not seek an injunction from this Court and the parties represent that the transaction has since been completed.

Footnote 2: At oral argument, the parties confirmed that petitioners have commenced a separate CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the June rehearing determination.

Footnote 3: We note that the PSC has offered its concession that the proceeding that petitioners have commenced challenging its June 2023 determination is timely. Nevertheless, we are called upon to address the import of the initial decision and, in that respect, that issue is largely irrelevant to our analysis.

Footnote 4: Notably, the PSC has undertaken an analysis pursuant to CLCPA § 7 (2) and (3) in assessing a petition seeking amendment to a certificate of public convenience and necessity (see Petition of Liberty Util. [St. Lawrence Gas] Corp. for an Expedited Modification to Its Certificate of Pub. Convenience and Necessity, NY PSC Case No. 22-G-0205, 2022 WL 14782575 [Oct. 17, 2022]).

                             Opinion by Justice Carlyle

       Day Trader Paradise, LLC and its founder and principal John Matthew Cowart

(collectively, DTP) appeal the trial court’s order denying their TCPA1 motion to

dismiss a legal action brought against them by EGI Ecclesiastes Global Investment

Technologies, LLC and its founder and principal Vincent Marchi (collectively, EGI).




   1
     The Texas Citizens Participation Act, TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 27.001–.011 (“Actions
Involving the Exercise of Certain Constitutional Rights”).
Because we conclude EGI’s legal action is exempt from TCPA coverage, we affirm

in this memorandum opinion. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.4.

Background

      In its live petition, EGI stated it is “in the business of Algorithmic Trading

Software & Educational Services for the futures, forex, crypto, and stocks trading

community.” EGI operates a YouTube channel on which Mr. Marchi, who is not a

licensed professional stock trader or advisor, “demonstrat[es] opportunities for

trades using his algorithmic trading platform” and “offers his thoughts” on trading-

related topics, including “other companies, day traders and YouTubers who claim to

offer alternative trading platforms.” According to the petition, “Mr. Cowart and Day

Trader Paradise, LLC run a competing YouTube channel offering similar trading

related software and educational services as [EGI], and they are in direct competition

for the same customers.”

      The petition stated EGI has “third party synergistic partnerships” with

“software platform providers” and “trading brokers for trade execution” including

NinjaTrader and AMP Global Clearing. Those entities have advertised on EGI’s

YouTube channel and EGI “has used them as the official brokers for those who wish

to trade in various trading instruments.” EGI’s relationships with those entities “are

key to the continued operation of [EGI], as without them, no referrals can be made

to their platform and no profit can be made therefrom.”



                                         –2–
      According to the petition, despite previously having had “many fractious

communications,” DTP and EGI engaged in discussions “concerning Plaintiffs’

business model, licensing, brokers, and their third-party relationships, such as

NinjaTrader and AMP, all with the understanding that such discussions were private

and not meant for public disclosure or disclosure to any third party.” The petition

stated, “Many client relationships and trade secrets were discussed with Mr. Cowart

with the intent that they develop a synergistic business together or so Mr. Marchi

was led to believe.”

      The petition alleged that at some point Mr. Cowart “broke off negotiations

abruptly.” Soon after that, Mr. Marchi (1) “received a notice from NinjaTrader that

they had received complaints from unknown clients and or third parties about his

business and personal affairs that therefore [sic], they would cease doing business

with him immediately,” and (2) “received notice from his AMP Broker that

complaints were received by third parties about his business and personal affairs that

were ‘unbecoming’ and that they would immediately cease all business with him and

his company.” The petition stated Mr. Marchi obtained information from AMP

showing the complaints “were alleged to be made by an ‘ADAM W,’ a pseudonym

of misleading affiliation and misdirection,” who allegedly was familiar with Mr.

Marchi’s business and “assert[ed] that [Mr. Marchi] was engaging in illegal trading

conduct, that he was improperly giving investment advice, was an abuser of children

and was a racist, all claims which are patently untrue.” According to the petition,

                                         –3–
“many of the claims were based on knowledge from communications [Mr. Marchi]

had solely with [Mr. Cowart] . . . in personal, private communications between the

two of them” concerning “their discussions of the nature of mutual synergistic

business opportunities together” and “could come from no other source.”

      The petition stated, “It is clear to Plaintiffs that Defendants are attempting to

threaten and harm the Plaintiffs, to intentionally interfere with their business, with

the intent to drive them from their business, steal their clients and cease broadcasting

on YouTube.” EGI asserted claims for statutory and common law misappropriation

of trade secrets, tortious interference with existing and prospective contracts, and

fraud, all of which incorporated the above-described allegations by reference.

      DTP generally denied the allegations and filed a motion to dismiss under the

TCPA and Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE

§ 27.003 (procedure for dismissal of legal action based on or in response to exercise

of right of free speech); TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a (“Dismissal of Baseless Causes of

Action”). DTP asserted that “[b]ecause Plaintiffs’ claims are based exclusively on

‘communication made in connection with a matter of public concern,’—i.e., the

racist and criminal conduct of a YouTube personality and trading software vendor—

Plaintiffs’ own First Amended Petition establishes applicability of the TCPA.” DTP

also contended:

      To the extent that Plaintiffs may argue that their fraud and trade secrets
      claims are exempt from the TCPA, that argument will likewise
      fail. . . . Plaintiffs’ fraud claim is actually a defamation claim for which

                                          –4–
      the statute of limitations has run. And Plaintiffs’ trade secret claims are
      not of the type exempted as they are not “a legal action arising from an
      officer-director, employee-employer, or independent contractor
      relationship.”

      EGI filed a response asserting, among other things, (1) the TCPA is

inapplicable because “there is no matter of public concern [and] no matter affecting

the Defendants’ right of free speech’”; (2) “[r]ather, the causes of action arise from

the personal and business relationships of the parties, and the Defendants’ improper

use of that information to the detriment of the Plaintiff”; and (3) the petition “does

not state or pursue any matter related to Section 27.010(b) of the Texas Civil Practice

& Remedies Code which would entitle the Defendant to relief under this section.”

Additionally, as to its fraud claim, EGI asserted “Defendants fraudulently entered

into business discussions with Plaintiffs with the intent to learn the business and

trade secrets of the Plaintiffs, and to interfere with their existing and prospective

contracts with vendors and customers for the benefit of Defendants,” and “Plaintiffs

relied on the representations made by the Defendants to their detriment.”

      At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, DTP argued EGI’s action was “filed

in retaliation . . . for [DTP] informing Plaintiffs’ trading platform that he was

breaking the rules,” which is “a matter of public concern” and “precisely the speech

the TCPA is meant to protect.” EGI’s counsel contended (1) “[t]his is a meritorious

claim against a person who entered into negotiations with my client deceptively in

order to steal his secrets” and (2) this lawsuit “falls right within” the exemption in


                                         –5–
TCPA section 27.010(a)(5) regarding actions seeking recovery for trade secret

misappropriation. Additionally, as to the fraud claim, EGI asserted that its petition

gave fair notice it was contending “[c]ommunications were had between Marchi and

[DTP] to go into business together and that was apparently all the fraud” and “was

entirely to use the information gathered to disrupt his business, disrupt his customer

base, and it was all a way to steal his secrets and harm his company to the advantage

of [DTP].” Following the hearing, the trial court signed a September 19, 2022 order

denying the TCPA motion to dismiss “in its entirety.”2

Analysis

        “The TCPA was designed to protect both a defendant’s rights of speech,

petition, and association and a claimant’s right to pursue valid legal claims for

injuries the defendant caused.” Montelongo v. Abrea, 622 S.W.3d 290, 299 (Tex.

2021); see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.002. Generally, the act provides that

“[i]f a legal action is based on or is in response to a party’s exercise of the right of

free speech, right to petition, or right of association or arises from any act of that

party in furtherance of the party’s communication or conduct described by Section

27.010(b), that party may file a motion to dismiss the legal action,” see TEX. CIV.

PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.003(a), and the trial court “shall dismiss” it. Id.



    2
      With regard to Rule 91a, the trial court’s order (1) granted the Rule 91a motion to dismiss as to EGI’s
common law misappropriation of trade secrets claim; (2) gave EGI leave to replead its fraud claim but did
not dismiss that claim; and (3) otherwise denied the Rule 91a dismissal motion. Those rulings are not at
issue in this interlocutory appeal. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 51.014(a)(12).
                                                    –6–
§ 27.005(b); see also id. § 27.001(3) (“‘Exercise of the right of free speech’ means

a communication made in connection with a matter of public concern.”). The party

bringing the legal action can avoid dismissal if it “establishes by clear and specific

evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question.” Id.

§ 27.005(c). But notwithstanding section 27.005(c), “the court shall dismiss a legal

action against the moving party if the moving party establishes an affirmative

defense or other grounds on which the moving party is entitled to judgment as a

matter of law.” Id. § 27.005(d).

      Section 27.010(a) describes types of actions exempt from the TCPA,

including, among other things,

           (5) a legal action arising from an officer-director, employee-
      employer, or independent contractor relationship that:
                  (A) seeks recovery for misappropriation of trade secrets or
                  corporate opportunities; or
                  (B) seeks to enforce a non-disparagement agreement or a
                  covenant not to compete; [or]
      ....
           (12) a legal action based on a common law fraud claim.

Id. § 27.010(a). However, notwithstanding those exemptions, section 27.010(b)

provides that the TCPA applies to legal actions against a person (1) arising from an

act related to gathering or processing information “for communication to the public”

for the creation or promotion of a journalistic or artistic work, see id. § 27.010(b)(1),

or (2) “related to the communication, gathering, receiving, posting, or processing of

consumer opinions or commentary, evaluations of consumer complaints, or reviews


                                          –7–
or ratings of businesses,” see id. § 27.010(b)(2). The nonmovant bears the burden of

proving a statutory exemption. See Kirkstall Rd. Enters., Inc. v. Jones, 

523 S.W.3d251, 253 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2017, no pet.) (citing Tervita, LLC v. Sutterfield, 

482S.W.3d 280, 282 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2015, pet. denied)).

      Whether the TCPA applies to a legal action is an issue of statutory

interpretation we review de novo. Temple v. Cortez Law Firm, PLLC, 657 S.W.3d

337, 341–42 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2022, no pet.); see Creative Oil & Gas, LLC v. Lona

Hills Ranch, LLC, 591 S.W.3d 127, 132 (Tex. 2019). Consistent with general rules

of statutory construction, we ascertain and give effect to the legislature’s intent as

expressed in the statutory language, considering the specific language at issue and

the TCPA as a whole, and we construe the statute’s words according to their plain

and common meaning unless a contrary intention is apparent from the context or

unless such a construction leads to absurd results. Temple, 657 S.W.3d at 342. We

consider, in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the pleadings, evidence a

court could consider under rule of civil procedure 166a, and supporting and opposing

affidavits stating the facts on which the liability or defense is based. Id.; TEX. CIV.

PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.006(a). A claimant’s pleadings are usually “the best and

all-sufficient evidence of the nature of the action.” Hersh v. Tatum, 

526 S.W.3d 462,467 (Tex. 2017).

      In two issues, DTP contends (1) the trial court erred by denying the TCPA

motion to dismiss because DTP showed its “alleged actions and speech” are

                                         –8–
protected by the TCPA and “[EGI] failed to present clear and specific evidence of a

prima facie case” as to any of its claims, and (2) this case should be remanded to the

trial court for consideration of attorney’s fees to DTP “in relation to the dismissal of

[EGI’s] claims under the TCPA.” According to DTP,

      Here, [EGI] did not deny that the communications at issue were related
      to criminal conduct—a matter of public concern. . . . [EGI] replied only
      to argue that the exception presented in Tex. Prac. & Rem. Code
      §27.010(a)(5) is applicable here. However, that section excepts from
      coverage under the TCPA “a legal action arising from an officer-
      director,    employee-employer,      or    independent        contractor
      relationship”—which is not at issue here whatsoever.

DTP asserts that “to the extent that [EGI] may argue that other exceptions under Tex.

Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §27.010 may apply,” those arguments “were not raised in

the court below” and thus have been “waived.”

      EGI argues the TCPA is inapplicable because, among other reasons, several

of section 27.010(a)’s exemptions apply, including section 27.010(a)(12). EGI

asserts:

      [T]he legal action seeks recovery of damages for the fraudulent conduct
      of the Defendants in seeking to enter into discussions to conduct
      business under false pretenses, and false statements made to established
      contracted vendors of the Plaintiff in an attempt to sabotage the
      established and future contracted relationships with such vendors. This
      is an exception to the [TCPA], which the trial court properly applied in
      denying this motion to dismiss.

Additionally, EGI contends both of section 27.010(b)’s exceptions to the act’s

exemptions are inapplicable and DTP has “not proved the relevance of either.”



                                          –9–
      When a TCPA movant’s burden to show applicability and a nonmovant’s

burden to prove an exemption are both challenged, this Court may consider the

nonmovant’s exemption first if it chooses to do so. Temple, 657 S.W.3d at 346 (citing

TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1). Here, for efficiency purposes, we start with the TCPA’s fraud

exemption. See id.; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 27.010(a)(12).

      First, we address DTP’s contention that this exemption was “not raised in the

court below” and thus was “waived.” EGI’s petition asserted (1) “[m]any client

relationships and trade secrets were discussed with Mr. Cowart with the intent that

they develop a synergistic business together or so Mr. Marchi was led to believe”

and (2) the business discussions “were private and not meant for public disclosure

or disclosure to any third party” but were later disclosed by DTP for its benefit.

DTP’s motion to dismiss stated “[t]o the extent that Plaintiffs may argue that their

fraud . . . claims are exempt from the TCPA,” that argument lacked merit because

the fraud claim “is actually a defamation claim for which the statute of limitations

has run.” In response to DTP’s motion to dismiss, EGI asserted DTP “fraudulently

entered into business discussions with Plaintiffs with the intent to learn the business

and trade secrets of the Plaintiffs, and to interfere with their existing and prospective

contracts with vendors and customers for the benefit of Defendants,” and “Plaintiffs

relied on the representations made by the Defendants to their detriment.”

Additionally, at the hearing, EGI asserted that its claims were based on DTP entering

into negotiations “deceptively” to steal EGI’s secrets.

                                         –10–
      On this record, we conclude EGI’s argument regarding the TCPA’s fraud

exemption was preserved for this Court’s review. See Adams v. Starside Custom

Builders, LLC, 547 S.W.3d 890, 896–97 (Tex. 2018) (concluding argument was

preserved for appellate review where party addressed concerns at TCPA hearing);

see also Greene v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 446 S.W.3d 761, 764 n.4 (Tex. 2014) (parties

may construct new arguments on appeal in support of issues raised below).

      Next, as described above, section 27.010(a)(12) states the TCPA does not

apply to “a legal action based on a common law fraud claim.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. &

REM. CODE § 27.010(a)(12). EGI asserted repeatedly in the trial court that its claims

were premised on DTP fraudulently entering into business discussions to obtain

information it then used to harm EGI. Thus, the record demonstrates EGI’s lawsuit

is “a legal action based on a common law fraud claim.” See Baylor Scott & White v.

Project Rose MSO, LLC, 633 S.W.3d 263, 285 & n.13 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2021, pet.

denied) (concluding fraud claim and all claims “based on the alleged fraudulent

scheme” were exempt from TCPA under § 27.010(a)(12)). DTP does not challenge

or address EGI’s assertion that section 27.010(b)’s exceptions are inapplicable, nor

does the record show either of those exceptions applies. We conclude EGI met its

burden to show its legal action is exempt from the TCPA pursuant to section

27.010(a)(12). Thus, the trial court did not err by denying the TCPA motion to

dismiss. We need not address DTP’s remaining issue. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.

Lead Opinion by Black

BLACK, Judge.
Jordan Marcum, her vicariously-liable employer, Artistic Pools of Florida Inc. (“Artistic Pools”), and her liability insurer, Allstate Insurance Company (“Allstate”), appeal an adverse judgment resulting from an automobile accident allegedly causing personal injuries to Angela Hayward.1 Three issues were raised on appeal; we find the first issue to be dispositive, and as a result, we do not reach the other two. Because it is undisputed that Ms. Marcum lost consciousness while driving due to a seizure, resulting in the accident, and because Ms. Marcum’s loss of consciousness was unforeseeable, the trial court should have directed a verdict for the defense. Therefore, we reverse.
I. Background
On the day of the accident, Ms. Marcum, assistant manager of Artistic Pools, was driving a company vehicle within the course and scope of her employment. Her coworker, Charles Heninger, was riding in the passenger seat. Ms. Marcum testified that she felt as though she momentarily blacked out, woke up briefly, and then blacked out again. Her next recollection was after the accident when the paramedics were present. According to Mr. Hen-inger, Ms. Marcum stated that she felt as though she had blacked out, stated that she did not feel well, asked where they were going, and then she suddenly lost consciousness. Mr. Heninger testified that he tried to stop the vehicle by depressing the brake pedal with his hand, but he was unable to reach it because of his seatbelt restraint. He testified that he was down on the floorboard when he felt an impact. Mr. Heninger estimated that at most fifteen seconds elapsed between the time Ms. Marcum indicated that she may have blacked out and the time of impact.
Ms. Hayward testified that she was stopped at a red light and saw the Artistic Pools vehicle in her rearview mirror. When she realized that the vehicle was not going to stop, she braced for impact, and the vehicle struck her car from behind. Ms. Hayward testified that after she was struck, she exited her car and walked toward the Artistic Pools vehicle, at which time she observed Ms. Marcum having a seizure. Ms. Hayward retrieved a blanket from her car and helped reposition Ms. Marcum so that she would not swallow her tongue.
Doctor Denise Griffin, a board certified neurologist, testified that Ms. Marcum could not have anticipated the seizure.
[Counsel:] Is there any way that Jordan Marcum should have anticipated that this type of event was going to occur?
[Dr. Griffin:] No, sir, not to my knowledge.
[Counsel:] And if there was some sort of warning sign, is that something you would expect a lay person to recognize as an oncoming seizure?
[Dr. Griffin:] No, sir, I couldn’t — I couldn’t tell if I were going to have a *697seizure, and I see seizure [sic] every day, because sometimes there is no warning, and if there is a warning, it can be just be as — as vague as a weird feeling, a funny taste in your mouth. It’s just very nonspecific and it doesn’t even need to be there.
[[Image here]]
[Counsel:] And is it fair to describe your opinion related to the seizure as it was one of [a] sudden and unexpected nature?
[Dr. Griffin:] Yes, sir.
Dr. GrifSn defined the seizure as “crypto-genic,” which by definition has no known cause.
Ms. Hayward did not offer opposing expert testimony regarding the seizure. Her only expert witness was an orthopedic surgeon who provided testimony about her injuries. In response to Ms. Marcum’s defense, Ms. Hayward argued that the episode was neither sudden nor unexpected. Ms. Hayward argued that when Ms. Mar-cum described a “funny feeling” prior to blacking out, she was experiencing what is known in neurologic terms as an “aura” which should have alerted her to pull over. Dr. Griffin explained that “[i]f a person feels an aura that they recognize is their epileptic aura ... they can, you know, sit down in a safe place.” However, Ms. Mar-cum testified that she had never experienced a seizure prior to the one that resulted in the accident.
Ms. Marcum argued that she experienced a sudden and unexpected seizure and that there was insufficient time between the onset of the seizure and the collision for her to take preventative action. Accordingly, she moved for a directed verdict. After hearing argument, the trial court denied Ms. Marcum’s motion, ruling that factual questions remained for jury determination as to whether Ms. Mar-cum could have avoided the impact.
II. Discussion
The standard of review on appeal of a trial court’s ruling on a motion for directed verdict is de novo. Fell v. Carlin, 6 So.3d 119, 120 (Fla. 2d DCA 2009). Here, we must determine if there is sufficient record evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Hayward to permit the jury to decide if Ms. Marcum was negligent or if Ms. Marcum’s sudden loss of consciousness defense required the verdict to be directed in her favor. See id. (quoting Sims v. Cristinzio, 898 So.2d 1004, 1005 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005)).
“It is well settled that negligence is not chargeable against the operator of a motor vehicle who, while driving, suffers a sudden loss of consciousness from an unforeseen cause.” Tropical Exterminators, Inc. v. Murray, 171 So.2d 432, 433 (Fla. 2d DCA 1965); see also Bridges v. Speer, 79 So.2d 679, 681 (Fla.1955) (“It is not even simple negligence if one has a sudden attack, loses control of his car and causes an accident if he had no premonition or warning.”); Feagle v. Purvis, 891 So.2d 1096, 1098-99 (Fla. 5th DCA 2004) (“As a general rule, the operator of an automobile, vessel or other mode of transportation who unexpectedly loses consciousness or becomes incapacitated is not chargeable with negligence as a result of his or her loss of control.”). To establish this defense, a defendant is required to prove the following:
1. The defendant suffered a loss of consciousness or capacity. See, e.g., Bridges v. Speer, 79 So.2d 679, 681 (Fla. 1955); Wilson v. The Krystal Co., 844 So.2d 827[, 828] (Fla. 5th DCA 2003).
2. The loss of consciousness or capacity occurred before the defendant’s purportedly negligent conduct. See Malcolm v. *698Patrick, 147 So.2d 188, 193 (Fla. 2d DCA 1962).
3. The loss of consciousness was sudden. See, e.g., Baker v. Hausman, 68 So.2d 572, 573 (Fla.1953); Malcolm [, 147 So.2d at 193].
4. The loss of consciousness or capacity was neither foreseen, nor foreseeable. See, e.g., Baker [, 68 So.2d at 573]; Wilson [, 844 So.2d at 828]; Wingate [v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 480 So.2d 665, 666 (Fla. 5th DCA 1985) ]; Malcolm [, 147 So.2d at 193].
Feagle, 891 So.2d at 1099.
Ms. Marcum successfully established her defense. It is undisputed that Ms. Marcum lost consciousness while driving as a result of a cryptogenic seizure. Her testimony, along with that of Mr. Heninger, established that she lost consciousness before the impact occurred. Further, she had never experienced a seizure before this incident, and there was no evidence that she had notice of being at risk for a seizure. Dr. Griffin testified that Ms. Marcum would have had no way to anticipate the onset of the cryptogenic seizure. Finally, the testimony of Ms. Marcum and Mr. Heninger established that there was insufficient time between the onset of the seizure and the impact with Ms. Hayward’s vehicle for her to take any evasive maneuvers.
“[F]oreseeability is the foundation for establishing the incapacity or loss of consciousness of a defendant .... ” Feagle, 891 So.2d at 1099. The fact that Ms. Marcum indicated to Mr. Heninger that she did not feel well, a sensation she later described as a “funny feeling,” shortly before losing consciousness, resulting in the accident, did not show that the impending seizure was foreseen. See Baker, 68 So.2d at 573 (holding that a showing that the driver was not feeling well shortly before the accident did not demonstrate a premonition of a stroke); Wingate, 480 So.2d at 666 (holding that driver’s statement made shortly before the accident that he was not feeling well did not demonstrate a premonition of a heart attack).
Accordingly, we reverse the final judgment and remand with instructions that judgment be entered in favor of Ms. Mar-cum, Artistic Pools, and Allstate.
Reversed and remanded with instructions.
KELLY and WALLACE, JJ„ Concur. 
. On August 23, 2012, the trial court rendered an order granting Ms. Hayward’s motion to join Allstate as a party defendant to the final judgment pursuant to section 627.4136(4), Florida Statutes (2012).

                   COURT OF APPEALS

            THIRTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS

             CORPUS CHRISTI – EDINBURG


FRANK AHLGREN III AND
THE COPERNICAN, LLC,                                     Appellants,

                                 v.

FRANK AHLGREN JR. AND
ELISE LEAKE, AS CO-TRUSTEES
OF THE AHLGREN MANAGEMENT
TRUST,                                                    Appellees.


            On appeal from the 261st District Court
                  of Travis County, Texas.


             MEMORANDUM OPINION ON
           ORDER REVIEWING SUPERSEDEAS

         Before Justices Longoria, Hinojosa, and Silva
          Memorandum Opinion by Justice Hinojosa
        Appellants Frank Ahlgren III (Paco)1 and The Copernican, LLC have appealed a

judgment in favor of appellees Frank Ahlgren Jr. (Nim) and Elisa Leake, in their capacity

as co-trustees of the Ahlgren Management Trust. Before the Court is appellants’ motion

to modify the trial court’s supersedeas order. 2 See TEX. R. APP. P. 24.4. We grant the

motion in part.

                                           I.       BACKGROUND

        Appellees sued appellants for various causes of action, alleging that Paco and his

company The Copernican “absconded” with assets that were held in trust for the benefit

of Paco’s father Nim. Appellees alleged that Paco commingled the trust assets with his

own and that Paco “accumulated substantial wealth, mainly through purchases of

cryptocurrency[3] made possible by Nim’s contributions . . . .” Appellees claimed that Paco

breached his fiduciary duty when he refused Nim’s request to return his share of the

assets in October of 2019.

        The case proceeded to trial, and a jury found in favor of appellees on their claims

for breach of trust, breach of informal fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. The jury found

that Paco used trust funds to acquire the following assets: (1) Bitcoin; (2) a Park City,

Utah property; (3) an Austin, Texas property; and (4) gold. The jury found that Paco



        1 To distinguish between the Ahlgren parties, who are father and son, we will refer to each by their
preferred names as set out in the parties’ filings.
       2 This cause is before the Court on transfer from the Third Court of Appeals in Austin pursuant to

a docket-equalization order issued by the Supreme Court of Texas. See TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 73.001.
          3 “A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium

of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government
or bank, to uphold or maintain it.” Cryptocurrency, WIKIPEDIA, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency
(last visited Apr. 8, 2022). “Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized
cryptocurrency.” Id.
                                                       2
obtained fifty percent of the foregoing assets with his own funds. It found that the value

of Nim’s share of the assets at the time of Paco’s breach was as follows: (1) $9,074,390 4

in Bitcoin; (2) $1,900,000 for the Park City property; and (3) $375,000 for the Austin

property. The jury was not asked to value Nim’s interest in gold. Finally, the jury found

that Paco earned a $29,329,378 profit resulting from his breach.

         Appellees filed a motion for entry of judgment, electing to recover on its breach of

trust claim. They requested monetary damages in the amount of $29,329,378 as well as

a constructive trust awarding a fifty percent interest in the aforementioned assets.

Appellees asserted that its request for money damages represented Paco’s “ill-gotten

gains/profit in breach of his fiduciary duties.” Appellees further requested a permanent

injunction to prevent the dissipation of assets that would be subject to the constructive

trust.

         The trial court signed a final judgment awarding $29,329,378 in damages and a

constructive trust over the following property: (1) 1,079 Bitcoins (fifty percent of the 2,158

Bitcoins held by Paco); (2) a fifty percent interest in the Park City property; (3) a fifty

percent interest in the Austin property; and (4) a fifty percent interest in gold held by Paco.

The final judgment contains a detailed calculation of the jury’s finding that Paco profited

$29,329,378 from his breach. It explains that the amount is based on the appreciation in

Bitcoin from the time of Paco’s breach to the date of trial. In particular, the value of a

single Bitcoin increased by $27,182 during this period. As explained in the judgment, the

jury’s profit calculation represents this appreciation multiplied by 1,079—the number of


         As we discuss later, the value of Bitcoin appreciated considerably between the time of Paco’s
         4

breach and the commencement of trial.
                                                  3
Bitcoins that the jury determined belonged to Paco.

       The final judgment included a permanent injunction restraining appellants from

“selling, transferring, or encumbering” the constructive trust assets. It also restrained

appellants from:

       selling, transferring, or encumbering any cryptocurrency, including [B]itcoin,
       (i) under the direct or indirect control or ownership of [appellants] as of the
       date of this judgment (including the proceeds of any such
       cryptocurrency . . .) or (ii) received from [appellants] after March 13, 2020
       [the date appellees filed suit], except as provided in Paragraph 5 [of the
       permanent injunction.]

Paragraph 5 of the permanent injunction permits appellants to sell cryptocurrency under

certain circumstances, conditioned upon appellees’ prior written consent and that the sale

be “for fair market value in an arm’s length transaction” with half of the proceeds to be

deposited in the registry of the trial court or at appellees’ direction.

       After appellees engaged in efforts to collect on the judgment, appellants filed an

emergency motion to set security for strictly the monetary portion of the judgment. In their

motion, appellants maintained that the $29,329,378 award was not compensatory

damages and that they need only post security in the amount of court costs. See TEX.

CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 52.006(a) (limiting the amount to supersede a money

judgment to compensatory damages, post-judgment interest, and costs); TEX. R. APP. P.

24.2(a)(1) (same). Appellees responded to the motion, requesting that the trial court set

security for the monetary award at the maximum amount of $25,000,000. Appellees filed

a counter motion requesting the trial court to set separate security of $45,504,235.40 5 to



       This amount represents the value of the 1,079 Bitcoins awarded to appellees as measured at the
       5

commencement of trial.
                                                 4
collectively supersede the constructive trust and permanent injunction parts of the

judgment. Appellees also requested that the trial court enter a post-judgment injunction,

maintaining that appellants were likely to transfer or dissipate assets to avoid satisfaction

of the judgment. Appellees cited evidence that Paco previously sold large quantities of

Bitcoin in violation of the trial court’s earlier temporary injunction and that he has engaged

in efforts to conceal his Bitcoin transactions.

       The trial court signed an order setting the amount of security as follows:

(1) $25,000,000 for the monetary award; and (2) $45,504,235.40 for the constructive trust

and permanent injunction collectively. The trial court found that “allowing [appellants] to

supersede only the monetary portion of the final judgment without also superseding the

constructive trust and injunctive portions of the final judgment as set forth herein will not

adequately protect [appellees] from any loss or damage that the appeal might cause.”

Thus, the trial court ordered “that the district clerk shall not accept any security attempting

to supersede the monetary portion of the final judgment in an amount less than set forth

herein unless security is also posted for the constructive trust . . . and the injunctive

portion of the final judgment.” The trial court ordered that if appellants were to post

security for $45,504,235.40, that such security “shall be sufficient to satisfy . . . the

monetary portion of the judgment.” The trial court issued the following post-judgment

injunction:

       [Appellants] are ENJOINED from dissipating or transferring assets subject
       to the constructive trust and/or permanent injunction without the prior written
       consent of [appellees] until such time as the security set forth herein has
       been posted in full or the judgment has been fully satisfied; provided,
       however, that neither this post-judgment injunction nor the constructive trust
       or permanent injunction in the final judgment prevents [appellees] from

                                              5
       satisfying all or part of the final judgment through execution, turnover, or
       other means in accordance with applicable law, including but not limited to
       execution on the Park City [p]roperty.

       Subsequently, appellants filed with this Court an emergency motion for temporary

relief seeking to stay enforcement of the judgment until which time we could review the

trial court’s supersedeas order. After receiving a response from appellees, we granted

the motion in part, temporarily staying execution or enforcement of the judgment pending

further order of this Court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 24.4(c).

       In their motion to review the trial court’s supersedeas order, appellants argue:

(1) the trial court set the wrong amount of security for the monetary award; (2) the trial

court failed to properly apply Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 24.2(a) in setting the

amount of security for the constructive trust and permanent injunction; and (3) the post-

judgment injunction should be vacated or modified. Appellees filed a response, generally

contending that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting security as it did.

                                     II.     DISCUSSION

A.     Standard of Review & Applicable Law

       A judgment debtor is entitled to supersede and defer payment of the judgment

while pursuing an appeal. Miga v. Jensen, 299 S.W.3d 98, 100 (Tex. 2009). Texas Rule

of Appellate Procedure 24.4 authorizes an appellate court to engage in a limited

supersedeas review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 24.4. On any party’s motion, we may review:

(1) the sufficiency or excessiveness of the amount of security, (2) the sureties on a bond,

(3) the type of security, (4) the determination whether to permit suspension of

enforcement, and (5) the trial court’s exercise of discretion in ordering the amount and


                                               6
type of security. See id. R. 24.4(a). We may require that the amount of a bond be

increased or decreased and that another bond be provided and approved by the trial court

clerk. See id. R. 24.4(d). We may also require other changes in the trial court’s order and

remand for entry of findings of fact or for the taking of evidence. See id.
       We review trial court’s supersedeas ruling using an abuse of discretion standard.

See EnviroPower, L.L.C. v. Bear, Stearns & Co., 265 S.W.3d 1, 2 (Tex. App.—Houston

[1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). A trial court “abuses its discretion when it renders an

arbitrary and unreasonable decision lacking support in the facts or circumstances of the

case,” or “when it acts in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner without reference to guiding

rules or principles.” Samlowski v. Wooten, 332 S.W.3d 404, 410 (Tex. 2011).

       Rule 24.1 provides that a judgment debtor may supersede the judgment by filing

a “good and sufficient bond” or “making a deposit with the trial court clerk in lieu of a

bond”—the amount of which is determined by Rule 24.2. TEX. R. APP. P. 24.1(a), (b).

Under Rule 24.2, the amount of the bond depends on the type of judgment, which could

either be a recovery of money, interest in property, or “something other than money or an

interest in property.” Id. R. 24.2(a)(1)–(a)(3). Rule 24.2 also permits the trial court to

“enjoin the judgment debtor from dissipating or transferring assets to avoid satisfaction of

the judgment.” Id. R. 24.2(d). However, “the trial court may not make any order that

interferes with the judgment debtor’s use, transfer, conveyance, or dissipation of assets

in the normal course of business.” Id.
B.     Monetary Award

       Appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion in setting the amount of


                                             7
security for the monetary award at $25 million because the award constituted an equitable

remedy and was not for compensatory damages. Accordingly, appellants maintain they

are entitled to supersede the monetary award by posting security for costs.

      “When the judgment is for money, the amount of the bond, deposit, or security

must equal the sum of compensatory damages awarded in the judgment, interest for the

estimated duration of the appeal, and costs awarded in the judgment.” Id. R. 24.2(a)(1);

see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 52.006(a). “[T]he [security] amount must not

exceed the lesser of: (A) 50 percent of the judgment debtor’s current net worth; or (B) 25

million dollars.” TEX. R. APP. P. 24.2(a)(1); see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.

§ 52.006(b). In other words, with respect to money judgments, a judgment debtor is only

required to post security for compensatory damages, interest, and costs. In re Longview

Energy Co., 464 S.W.3d 353, 358 (Tex. 2015) (orig. proceeding). “Compensatory

damages” include damages intended to compensate a claimant for an “actual economic

or pecuniary loss.” Imagine Auto. Grp., Inc. v. Boardwalk Motor Cars, LLC, 

356 S.W.3d716, 718 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.) (quoting BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 416 (8th ed.

2007)); cf. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 41.001(4) (under Chapter 41,

compensatory damages include “damages intended to compensate a claimant for actual

economic or pecuniary loss”). The judgment’s description of damages is not definitive as

to the type of damages awarded. Eagle Oil & Gas Co. v. Shale Expl., LLC, 

510 S.W.3d92, 95 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, no pet.). “Rather, when the characterization

of an amount as ‘compensatory’ is challenged by the judgment debtor in the context of

determining the bond amount, then the judgment creditor must respond beyond the


                                            8
characterization of the award in the judgment.” Id.
       Here, the judgment awards appellees $29,329,378, which corresponds to the jury’s

finding that Paco profited in this amount as a result of his breach of duty as trustee. The

final judgment meticulously recreates the jury’s profit calculation, explaining that the

amount represents the appreciation in Paco’s fifty percent share of Bitcoin from the date

of his breach to the commencement of trial. By virtue of the constructive trust awarding

the remaining fifty percent interest in the Bitcoin, appellees realized the same appreciation

in value. In other words, the final judgment awards appellees fifty percent of the disputed

Bitcoin holdings plus the appreciation in value of Paco’s fifty percent interest.

       We conclude that the monetary award constitutes the equitable remedy of profit

disgorgement. This classification tracks the judgment’s explanation of the award,

appellees’ pleadings which sought “profit disgorgement,” and appellees’ representation

to the trial court that the award represented Paco’s “ill-gotten gains/profit in breach of his

fiduciary duties.” “Disgorgement is an equitable forfeiture of benefits wrongfully obtained

. . . .” Longview Energy, 464 S.W.3d at 361. Such a remedy is available where, as here,

“a person who renders service to another in a relationship of trust . . . breaches that trust.”

Id. (quoting Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d 229, 237 (Tex. 1999)). “[E]quitable forfeiture ‘is

not mainly compensatory . . . nor is it mainly punitive’ and ‘cannot . . . be measured by

. . . actual damages.’” Id. (quoting Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 240). “The main purpose of

forfeiture is not to compensate an injured principal, . . . [it] is to protect relationships of

trust by discouraging agents’ disloyalty.” Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 238. 6


       6  We disagree with appellees that the availability of profit disgorgement as a statutory remedy
under the Texas Trust Code changes the nature of the award to compensatory damages. See TEX. PROP.
                                                  9
        Because the monetary award does not constitute compensatory damages,

appellants are not required to post security for that amount. See Longview Energy, 

464S.W.3d at 361 (concluding that judgment debtor was not required to post security for profit

disgorgement awarded in final judgment). Rather, to supersede this portion of the

judgment, appellants are only required to post security in the amount of costs awarded in

the judgment. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 52.006(a); TEX. R. APP. P.

24.2(a)(1). Therefore, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion by requiring

$25,000,000 as security for the monetary award. See EnviroPower, 265 S.W.3d at 2.

        We also note that the trial court’s order appears to make superseding of the

monetary award contingent upon appellants superseding other parts of the judgment. The

trial court’s order requires appellants “to supersede the monetary relief, the constructive

trust, and the injunctive relief” if they “wish to supersede the final judgment.”

        In 2003, the Texas Legislature enacted § 52.006 of the civil practice and remedies

code, which explicitly entitles a judgment debtor to supersede a money judgment,

requiring security only for compensatory damages, interest, and costs. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &

REM. CODE ANN. § 52.006 (“Amount of Security for Money Judgment”). The Texas

Supreme Court then amended Rule 24.2 of the rules of appellate procedure to track the

new statute, while also providing the means to supersede other types of awards. See

Longview Energy, 464 S.W.3d at 359 (“We amended Rule 24.2 . . . to track [§] 52.006[.]”).

Read together, § 52.006 and Rule 24.2 permit a judgment debtor to separately supersede

the monetary portion of the judgment and impose a maximum amount for that security.



CODE. ANN. § 114.001 (addressing liability of trustee to beneficiary for breach of trust).
                                                     10
See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 52.006(a); TEX. R. APP. P. 24.2(a)(1)–(3);

Longview Energy, 464 S.W.3d at 362 (holding that the defendant was “entitled to

supersede the money award in the judgment”); see also Mathis v. Benavides, 

511 S.W.3d294, 297 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2016, order) (“A judgment debtor is entitled to

supersede a money judgment.”); Kanan v. Plantation Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc., No. 13-

11-00282-CV, 2012 WL 593067, at *3 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg Feb. 21,

2012, order) (mem. op.) (discussing the varying security requirements under Rule 24.2).

Therefore, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in conditioning the

suspension of the monetary award on appellants’ posting of security for other portions of

the judgment. See EnviroPower, 265 S.W.3d at 2.

C.     Constructive Trust

       We next address appellants’ challenge to the security required for the constructive

trust portion of the judgment. Here, the constructive trust awards appellees an interest in

both real property (real estate) and personal property (Bitcoin and gold). Appellants argue

that the trial court erred in not requiring a separate security amount for each portion of the

constructive trust. We disagree.

       Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 24.2(a)(2) provides:

       When the judgment is for the recovery of an interest in real or personal
       property, the trial court will determine the type of security that the judgment
       debtor must post. The amount of that security must be at least:

              (A)    the value of the property interest’s rent or revenue, if the
                     property interest is real; or

              (B)    the value of the property interest on the date when the court
                     rendered judgment, if the property interest is personal.

TEX. R. APP. P. 24.2(a)(2). Unlike the provisions governing security for money judgments,
                                             11
Rule 24.2(a)(2) provides the trial court with considerable discretion to determine the

amount and “the type of security that the judgment debtor must post.” Id. In further

contrast, the Rule sets no ceiling on the amount of security that the trial court can require.

See id. Rather, the Rule sets a floor, which is determined by the nature of the property

interest. See id.; see also In re Port Isabel Logistical Offshore Terminal, Inc., No. 13-21-

00368-CV, 2022 WL 709472, at *14 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg Mar. 10, 2022,

no pet. h.) (combined app. & orig. proceeding) (“The rule states that the amount of security

must be ‘at least’ the property’s value but it does not, explicitly or implicitly, restrict the

trial court from ordering security in excess of that amount.”). Here, the record establishes

that, among the constructive trust assets, the Bitcoin holdings were the most valuable.

Appellees suggested to the trial court that the value of appellees’ interest in Bitcoin at the

time of trial—$45,504,235.40 7 —would be adequate security for the entirety of the

constructive trust. Thus, this amount served as a floor for the amount of security required.

While the trial court could have required more security, it could not have required less.

Further, appellants cite no authority, nor have we found any, requiring the trial court to

set separate security amounts for each part of a constructive trust. See TEX. R. APP. P.

38.1(i). Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting

the amount of security based on the value of appellees’ interest in Bitcoin. See

EnviroPower, 265 S.W.3d at 2.

D.     Permanent Injunction

       Next, appellants argue that the trial court’s order erroneously prohibits appellants


       7   Appellants do not dispute this valuation.
                                                       12
from superseding the permanent injunction without requiring appellees to post

countersecurity. The amount of security required to suspend an injunction is governed by

Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 24.2(a)(3), which provides:

       When the judgment is for something other than money or an interest in
       property, the trial court must set the amount and type of security that the
       judgment debtor must post. The security must adequately protect the
       judgment creditor against loss or damage that the appeal might cause. But
       the trial court may decline to permit the judgment to be superseded if the
       judgment creditor posts security ordered by the trial court in an amount and
       type that will secure the judgment debtor against any loss or damage
       caused by the relief granted the judgment creditor if an appellate court
       determines, on final disposition, that that relief was improper.

TEX. R. APP. P. 24.2(a)(3). We reject appellants’ contention that the trial court prohibited

them from superseding the permanent injunction. Rather, the trial court merely tied the

amount of security for the permanent injunction to the amount required for the

constructive trust. The trial court found that this amount would “act as an adequate

security for the injunctive relief granted in the final judgment” and would “adequately

protect [appellees] in respect to the loss or damage an appeal might cause.”

       We also disagree with appellants’ argument that the trial court was prohibited from

setting an amount of security to collectively supersede the constructive trust and

permanent injunction. Rule 24.2(a)(3) again affords the trial court broad discretion to “set

the amount and type of security that the judgment debtor must post.” Id. The permanent

injunction restrained appellants from “selling, transferring, or encumbering” the

constructive trust assets as well as other cryptocurrency held by Paco that were not

awarded to appellees. Given the broad scope of the permanent injunction and the value

of the assets at issue, we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion


                                            13
by requiring security of $45,504,235.40 to collectively supersede the permanent injunction

and constructive trust. See EnviroPower, 265 S.W.3d at 2. Accordingly, we deny

appellants’ challenge to this portion of the trial court’s supersedeas order.

E.     Post-Judgment Injunction

       Finally, appellants argue that the post-judgment injunction is erroneous. “The trial

court may enjoin the judgment debtor from dissipating or transferring assets to avoid

satisfaction of the judgment, but the trial court may not make any order that interferes with

the judgment debtor’s use, transfer, conveyance, or dissipation of assets in the normal

course of business.” TEX. R. APP. P. 24.2(d).

       Here, the post-judgment injunction prohibits appellants from “dissipating or

transferring assets subject to the constructive trust and/or permanent injunction without

the prior written consent of [appellees] until such time as the security set forth herein has

been posted in full or the judgment has been fully satisfied[.]” Functionally, the post-

judgment injunction simply incorporates the provisions of the permanent injunction.

Should appellants post security for the permanent injunction, the restrictions of both the

permanent injunction and the post-judgment injunction are lifted. Accordingly, we view

appellants’ complaints about the scope of the post-judgment injunction as a premature

challenge to the merits of the permanent injunction, and we decline to reach those

arguments at this time. See TEX. R. APP. P. 24.4; see also BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Red Deer

Res., LLC, No. 07-14-00032-CV, 2014 WL 3419496, at *2 (Tex. App.—Amarillo July 11,

2014, order) (mem. op.) (“The merits of an appeal are not addressed through a [R]ule 24




                                             14
review.”). 8

        Next, appellants argue that the post-judgment injunction improperly permits

appellees “to satisfy[] all or part of the final judgment through execution, turnover, or other

means in accordance with applicable law, including but not limited to execution on the

Park City [p]roperty.” Appellants maintain that this language exceeds the trial court’s

jurisdiction because it modifies the final judgment. In particular, appellants state that this

provision allows appellees to destroy appellants’ fifty percent interest in the Park City

property to satisfy the money award in the judgment. We agree.

        A trial court retains “continuing jurisdiction to modify the amount and type of

security required to . . . suspend execution of the judgment, even after the trial court’s

plenary power has otherwise expired.” Whitmire v. Greenridge Place Apartments, 

333S.W.3d 255, 260 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. dism’d) (citing TEX. R. APP.

P. 24.3(a); Lowe v. Monsanto Co., 965 S.W.2d 741, 742 n.8 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1998,

pet. denied)). However, this authority does not permit a trial court to alter or modify the

final judgment. Id. By permitting appellees to obtain a 100% interest in the Park City

property and potentially other parts of the constructive trust to satisfy the judgment’s

monetary award, the trial court’s supersedeas order improperly modifies the judgment

after the expiration of its plenary power. Therefore, we strike this provision of the

supersedeas order as void. See Malone v. Hampton, 182 S.W.3d 465, 468 (Tex. App.—


        8  We further reject appellants’ contention that there was insufficient evidence before the trial court
to justify a post-judgment injunction. In their counter motion to set security, appellees cited to various
attached exhibits as well as records on file with the trial court, from which the trial court could have
determined that appellants would likely make transfers to avoid satisfaction of the judgment. See TEX. R.
APP. P. 24.2(d). This record demonstrated that Paco engaged in several transfers of Bitcoin in violation of
a prior temporary injunction by liquidating over $1.4 million in Bitcoin.

Dallas 2006, no pet.) (noting that judicial actions taken after expiration of court’s plenary

power are nullities, and orders signed outside the court’s plenary jurisdiction are void).

                                    III.    CONCLUSION

       We grant in part appellant’s motion to review supersedeas. We order that the

amount of security for the monetary portion of the judgment be set at the amount of costs

awarded in the final judgment. We further order that appellants’ ability to supersede the

monetary portion of the judgment is not conditioned on whether appellants also

supersede the other portions of the judgment. We strike as void the following language in

the post-judgment injunction:

       provided, however, that neither this post-judgment injunction nor the
       constructive trust or permanent injunction in the final judgment prevents
       Plaintiff from satisfying all or part of the final judgment through execution,
       turnover, or other means in accordance with applicable law, including but
       not limited to execution on the Park City Property.

We leave undisturbed the remainder of the trial court’s supersedeas order. We lift the

stay previously imposed by our March 8, 2022 order. Should appellants fail to post the

amended supersedeas bond twenty days after the date of this order, the judgment may

be enforced. See TEX. R. APP. P. 24.4(e).
